The ImageTerrier Image Retrieval Platform

  Welcome to the home of ImageTerrier, the terabyte retriever for images. 

  ImageTerrier is an open-source, scalable, high-performance search engine platform for content-based image retrieval applications. The ImageTerrier platform provides a comprehensive test-bed for experimenting with image retrieval techniques. The platform incorporates a state-of-the-art implementation of the single-pass indexing technique for constructing inverted indexes and is capable of producing highly compressed index data structures. ImageTerrier is written as an extension to the open-source {{{http://www.terrier.org}Terrier test-bed platform for textual information retrieval research}}. 

  ImageTerrier is available as a modular set of Jars and the source is also available (under the terms of the {{{./license.html}Mozilla Public License}}). For more information about installing the source code, integrating the jars with your java project or using the command line tools please consult the {{{http://www.sf.net/p/imageterrier/wiki}wiki}}. ImageTerrier's sister project {{{http://www.openimaj.org}OpenIMAJ}} provides numerous implementations of image features that can be indexed using ImageTerrier.
