 * Class capable of extracting local descriptors from an interest point {@link InterestPointData} from an interest point detector {@link InterestPointDetector}. 
 * The actual feature extracted is determined by the {@link GradientFeatureProvider} that
 * is provided by the {@link GradientFeatureProviderFactory} set during
 * construction.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The GradientFeatureExtractor first calculates the dominant orientation
 * of the image patch described by the {@link InterestPointImageExtractorProperties}
 * and then iterates over the pixels in an oriented square, centered on the
 * interest point, passing the gradient and magnitude values of the respective
 * pixel to the {@link GradientFeatureProvider}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The size of the sampling square is exactly equal to the patch in the properties, this is in turn controlled
 * by the interest point's scale and possibly its shape. For some types of feature provider, this number
 * might need to be set based on the internal settings of the provider.
