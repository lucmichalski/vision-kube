The libraries and headers required are all included so it should all just be a matter of compile and go. 
if it isnt' which it never is, you need to go download videoInclude and build that again. There were massive problems but the main issue came from videoInclude not
being compilable on visual studios 10, it needs 2008. No exception. so yeah. that.
