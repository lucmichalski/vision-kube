/**
 * 	A super class for classes which are able to process videos. This class
 * 	can be used in two ways: one as a stand-alone video processor and another
 * 	as a chainable video processor.
 * 	<p>
 * 	As a stand-alone processor it may be used as such:
 * 	{@code
 * 		MyVideoProcessor vp = new MyVideoProcessor();
 * 		vp.process( myVideo );
 * 	}
 * 	<p>
 * 	As a chainable processor it may be used as so:
 * 	{@code
 * 		MyVideoProcessor vp = new MyVideoProcessor( myVideo );
 * 		MyOtherProcessor op = new MyOtherProcessor( vp );
 * 		AnotherProcessor ap = new AnotherProcessor( op );
 * 		ap.process();
 * 	}
 * 	<p>
 * 	If any of the chain-based functions are called when the video has not
 * 	been set, an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} is thrown.
 * 	<p>
 * 	In the same way that {@link ImageProcessor}s are expected to change the
 * 	image content, video processors should change the video frame content
 * 	in place, returning new altered frames. If you do not need to do this
 * 	then use the VideoAnalyser.
