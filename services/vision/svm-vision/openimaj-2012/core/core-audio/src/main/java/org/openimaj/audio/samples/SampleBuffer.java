/**
 * 	This class provides a consistent API for access samples of different
 * 	sizes (e.g. 8-bit and 16-bit). Subclasses implement get and set methods 
 * 	for samples in a sample byte buffer. The getters and setters return and 
 * 	take floats in all cases, so it is up to the implementing class to decide
 * 	how best to convert the incoming value to an appropriate value for the
 * 	sample buffer. The values given and expected should be normalised between
 * 	{@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} and {@link Integer#MIN_VALUE}. Despite using
 * 	floats, this allows us to detect clipping. Return values are signed such
 * 	that no signal has sample value 0. If the audio has multiple channels
 * 	they will occur in the same order as the original file (likely to be
 * 	multiplexed - so <c>get(0)</c> will be channel 1 and <c>get(1)</c> 
 * 	will be channel 2, etc.).
