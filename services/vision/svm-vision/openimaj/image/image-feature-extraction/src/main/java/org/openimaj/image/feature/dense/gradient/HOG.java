/**
 * Implementation of an extractor for the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
 * feature for object detection. This implementation allows any kind of spatial
 * layout to be used through different implementations of
 * {@link SpatialBinningStrategy}s. HOG features can be efficiently extracted
 * for many windows of the image.
 * <p>
 * The actual work of computing and normalising the descriptor is performed by
 * the {@link SpatialBinningStrategy} (i.e. a {@link FixedHOGStrategy} or
 * {@link FlexibleHOGStrategy}); this class just provides the objects required
 * for efficient histogram computation (namely a
 * {@link GradientOrientationHistogramExtractor}) for the image being analysed.
 * <p>
 * Normally, HOG features are computed using all gradients in the image, but
 * this class makes it possible to only consider gradients at the edges using
 * the {@link #analyseImage(FImage, FImage)} method.
