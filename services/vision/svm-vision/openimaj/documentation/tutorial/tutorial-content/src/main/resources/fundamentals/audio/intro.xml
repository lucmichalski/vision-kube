	OpenIMAJ started as a library for image processing, then expanded to video processing.
	The natural extension to dealing with videos is audio processing and has an important
	role in many applications of multimedia understanding. In this chapter we'll go through
	the basic audio subsystem in OpenIMAJ and show how to extract features from audio that
	can then be used in the various other tools in OpenIMAJ.
