# Backend #

- make face recognisers have methods to load/save themselves (not using serialisable!!)

# Commandline #
Tool for constructing a recogniser from a set of images
Tool for loading a recogniser and querying it

# Web Services #
- Face Detection
 - Given image return list of detections, eye locations, etc
- Face Recognition
 + training
 + querying


# Done # 
- add the concept of a facial comparator that can e.g. return probabilities, etc
- Refactor DetectedFace
 + Allow for different alignment techniques; perhaps detected face should just contain a single image - that of the actual detected face in the image, then other reps can be extracted as required...
