"""Interface to the model learning part of LibARTOS.

Provides the ModelLearner class on the one hand, which can be used to learn WHO models based on image data
from ImageNet, from file or from PIL.Image.Image objects.
On the other hand, this module contains the ModelManager and Model classes, which can be used to list,
modify and visualize the learned models.
