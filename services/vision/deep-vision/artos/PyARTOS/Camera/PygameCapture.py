"""Camera abstraction layer for Linux using pygame.

The Capture class provided from this module uses the pygame package
for Python to access video devices. This is intended to be used on Linux
systems, since pygame itself falls back to the VideoCapture package on
Windows, which can be used directly by the WinCapture camera abstraction layer.
