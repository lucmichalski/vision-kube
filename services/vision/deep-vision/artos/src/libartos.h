* Procedural C-style interface to ARTOS, the Adaptive Real-Time Object Detection system.
*
* This file provides a procedural interface to the object detection, whitened HOG model learning
* and image retrieval functionalities of ARTOS for integrating libartos into other projects
* created with any programming language.
*
* The **detection interface** is handle-controlled. First, you create a detector instance by calling
* `create_detector`, which returns a (numerical) handle. Any other detection related functions take
* this handle as first parameter and will operate on that detector instance.  
* Add some models to the detector using either `add_model` or `add_models` and run the detector on
* your images with one of the `detect_*` functions.  
* Don't forget to destroy the detector instance using `destroy_detector` if you don't need it any more.
*
* To **learn new models** either the all-in-one short-cut functions like `learn_imagenet` or `learn_files_jpeg`
* can be used or the handle-controlled learner interface, which is more complex, but gives you more control
* over the details of the model learning process. A learner instance is created by calling `create_learner`.
* After that, samples can be added either from ImageNet, from file or from raw pixel data using one of the
* `learner_add_*` functions. The actual learning step is performed by `learner_run` and, optionally,
* `learner_optimize_th`. Finally, the learned model can be saved with `learner_save`.  
* The all-in-one short-cut functions mentioned above handle all those steps with just one function call.
*
* The **ImageNet interface** provides functionality for searching synsets and extracting whole images
* as well as samples of objects from them to disk. In-memory extraction as provided by the object-oriented
* interface, `ImageRepository` and it's related classes, is not supported in this C-style library interface.  
* In the default implementation, all images and annotations from ImageNet have to be downloaded and made
* available on the filesystem (that are some terabytes of data). See the documentation of the `ImageRepository`
* class for how to structure your local copy of ImageNet.

//     Background Statistics
//-------------------------------

/**
* Learns a negative mean and a stationary covariance matrix as autocorrelation function from ImageNet samples.
* Both are required for learning WHO models. This expensive computation has only to be done once and the default
* background statistics shipped with ARTOS should be sufficient for most purposes.
* @param[in] repo_directory The path to the image repository directory.
* @param[in] bg_file Path to save the learned background statistics to.
* @param[in] num_images Number of ImageNet samples to extract features from for learning background statistics.
* @param[in] max_offset Maximum available offset in x or y direction of the autocorrelation function to be learned.
*                       Determines the maximum size of the reconstructible covariance matrix, which will be `maxOffset + 1`.
* @param[in] progress_cb Optionally, a callback which is called between the steps of the learning process to populate the progress.  
*                        The first parameter to the callback will be the number of steps performed in the entire process,
*                        the second one will be the total number of steps. To date, the entire process is divided into just two steps:
*                        Learning a negative mean and learning an autocorrelation function.  
*                        The third and fourth parameters will be the number of processed images and the total number of images (equal
*                        to `numImages`) of the current sub-procedure.  
*                        The callback may return false to abort the operation. To continue, it must return true.
* @param[in] accurate_autocorrelation By default, this function uses an efficient method of computing an autocorrelation function,
*                                     which leverages the Fourier transform. By setting this parameter to true, the original, inefficient
*                                     method, adapted from the original code of Hariharan et al., will be used. It is orders of magnitude slower
*                                     and will take very, very long, but gives results with higher accuracy.
*                                     That inaccuracy of the fast method results in a slight decrease of the performance of models learnt with
*                                     the efficiently computed statistics (the deviation will be around 5% of the average precision of the other
*                                     model, e. g. from 20% to 19%).
