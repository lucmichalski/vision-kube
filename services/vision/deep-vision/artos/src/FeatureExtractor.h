/**
* @file
* Defines the default feature extractor (usually HOGFeatureExtractor) and a feature pyramid class based on that extractor.

* If you want to use your own feature extractor by default, provide a class with at least the
* same interface as HOGFeatureExtractor, include it here and re-define `FeatureExtractor` in this file.
* Such a custom feature extractor will then be used for model learning and estimation of background statistics,
* but not for the FFLD-based object detection, which always uses HOG features.
