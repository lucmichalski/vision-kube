/**
* Handles learning of WHO (*Whitened Histogram of Orientations* [Hariharan et. al.]) models using
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
*
* Here's our **learning method** in a nutshell: \f$m = \Sigma^{-1} \cdot (\mu_{pos} - \mu_{neg})\f$
*
* Average the HOG (*Histogram of Oriented Gradients* [Dalal & Triggs]) features of each positive sample,
* centre them by subtracting the previously learned negative mean `neg` and decorrelate ("whiten") them with
* the also previously learned covariance matrix `S`.
*
* The typical **work-flow** for using this class is as follows:
*   1. Create a new model learner and pass in background statistics as StationaryBackground object or file name.
*   2. Add some positive samples, i. e. JPEG images of the object to be learned.
*   3. Call learn() to perform the actual learning step.
*   4. (*Optional*) Call optimizeThreshold() to determine an appropriate threshold for the learned model.
*   5. Write the model to file using save().
