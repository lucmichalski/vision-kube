/**
* Class for reading and writing stationary background statistics, i. e. general mean and covariance, from/to a binary file.
*
* Beyond that, this class is also capable of reconstructing a covariance matrix of a specific size from the stationary
* autocorrelation function read before.  
* The great deal behind this: Each covariance between two cells \f$x_{i,j}\f$ and \f$x_{m,n}\f$ only depends on the offset \f$(m-i, n-j)\f$.
* Since there are only N offsets given a total of N cells, the autocorrelation function only has to come up with
* \f$\mathcal{O}(N \cdot num\_features^2)\f$ instead of \f$\mathcal{O}(N^2 \cdot num\_features^2)\f$, which the full covariance matrix needs.  
* Therefore, N, i. e. the number of spatial offsets used for learning the statistics, is the upper bound for the number
* of rows and columns of reconstructed covariance matrices.
*
* This class may also be used to learn such statistics from ImageNet images using learnMean() and learnCovariance().

    * Learns a spatial autocorrelation function from features extracted from different positions at various scales
    * of a set of images. Use writeToFile() to save the learned statistics afterwards.
    *
    * To compute the autocorrelation function of two feature planes \$fI\$f and \$fJ\$f, this function leverages the
    * Fourier transform and computes:
    *
    * \f[ \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left ( \overline{\mathcal{F} \left(I \right) } \circ \mathcal{F} \left(J \right) \right ) \f]
    *
    * This is an order of magnitude faster than the method originally used by Hariharan et al., which is provided by
    * learnCovariance_accurate(). Since the Fourier transform implies a cyclic model at the borders of the image, the
    * autocorrelation function computed with this efficient method won't exactly equal the one computed by `learnCovariance_accurate()`.
    * This inaccuracy results in a slight decrease of the performance of models learnt with the efficiently computed statistics
    * (the deviation will be around 5% of the average precision of the other model, e. g. from 20% to 19%). 
    *
    * @note Computing the covariance matrices requires a mean feature vector, which has to be loaded from file
