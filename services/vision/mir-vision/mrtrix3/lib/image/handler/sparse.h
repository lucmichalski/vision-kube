      // A quick description of how the sparse image data are currently stored:
      // * The data are either after the image data within the same file if extension is .msf, or
      //     in a separate file with the .sdat extension if the image extension if .msh
      // * The image header must store the fields defined in lib/image/sparse/key.h
      //     These are currently verified on construction of the BufferSparse class. This proved to
      //     be simpler than trying to verify class matching on every interaction with the handler
      //     using templated functions.
      // * The raw image data consists of unsigned 64-bit integer values. These values correspond to
      //     an offset from the start of the sparse data (wherever that may be) to the sparse data
      //     stored for that particular voxel.
      // * Wherever sparse data for a voxel is stored, the data begins with a single unsigned 32-bit
      //     integer, which encodes the number of elements in that voxel. The following data is then
      //     a raw memory dump of that many instances of the relevant class type.
      // * When a sparse image is created for writing, a single unsigned 32-bit integer value of 0
      //     is written at the start of the sparse data. This is done so that uninitialised voxels
      //     can have their raw image value set to 0, and if they are dereferenced, the handler will
      //     indicate that there are zero elements for that voxel.
      // * The handler does not attempt any type of endianness conversion of the sparse data, so the
      //     systems that read/write the image files must have the same endianness. Since this can't
      //     be determined from the sparse data alone, the relevant Image::Format instead enforces
      //     the endianness of the image data to be native, and assumes that the sparse data has
      //     the same endianness. If the endianness does not match, the file won't open.
