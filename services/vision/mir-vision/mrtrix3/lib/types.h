/*! \defgroup VLA Variable-length array macros
 *
 * The reason for defining these macros at all is that VLAs are not part of the
 * C++ standard, and not available on all compilers. Regardless of the
 * availability of VLAs, they should be avoided if possible since they run the
 * risk of overrunning the stack if the length of the array is large, or if the
 * function is called recursively. They can be used safely in cases where the
 * size of the array is expected to be small, and the function will not be
 * called recursively, and in these cases may avoid the overhead of allocation
 * that might be incurred by the use of e.g. a std::vector.

/*! \def VLA_MAX
