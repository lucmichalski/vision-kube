This package contains the Matlab codes implemention of Cross-Age Reference Coding in our ECCV paper:

Cross-Age Reference Coding for Age-Invariant Face Recognition and Retrieval

In order to run the code, you first need to download the dataset feature (celebrity2000.mat) from

    http://bcsiriuschen.github.io/CARC/

and put the dataset in the same directory.

    Run main.m to reproduce the result in the paper.
