In October 1876 , it was announced that the three judges all agreed that Woods ' composition was the clear winner .
This proved to help its success when the Premier George Grey visited Lawrence on 11 March 1878 and was welcomed by six hundred local schoolchildren singing what was by then beginning to be labeled as the `` national anthem '' .
By doing this , he composed the tune to what later became New Zealand 's national anthem .
His father was a soldier .
Being a choirmaster , Woods ' focus in composing the melody was to make it simple and easy for children to sing .
He immediately arranged for it to be printed by Hopwood and Crew in London , with Bracken 's blessing .
When Woods was made an Honorary Freeman of New Zealand , he was commended for his `` efficiency , integrity and devotion to duty '' .
The end result was a very poor edition with only one verse , which was thrown out by the Advertiser .
He is best known for winning a competition to set `` God Defend New Zealand '' , a poem by Thomas Bracken , to music .
The prize was ten guineas .
Woods was also the Tuapeka County Council clerk for 55 years .
Woods was known as a good musician .
In 1877 , Woods stopped teaching and became the county clerk for the Tuapeka County Council .
Eight years teaching in New Zealand led to a position as the head teacher of St Patrick 's School in Lawrence , Otago , and he moved there from Invercargill in 1874 .
They were married in September 1874 and had four children together , three sons and a daughter named Mary .
He also organised the decoration of council office buildings to mark Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 .
According to tradition , he usually met the coach that delivered the news in the main street of Lawrence to pick up his paper .
He was also known as an expert on cultivating daffodils , of which his collection was the largest in the area .
It was already 9 pm , but he went straight to his piano and in that one sitting composed the tune for what later became the national anthem .
After teaching in Tasmania for nine years , he came to New Zealand as a young man and worked for a time in Nelson , Christchurch , Dunedin and Invercargill .
He was choirmaster of the local Catholic church , and could play twelve different instruments , though he was best known for his skill on the violin .
Woods was born in Tasmania in 1849 into an Irish family with fourteen other children , seven boys and seven girls .
In 1902 , Woods built a house of brick and wood on the corner of Lismore and Lancaster Streets . He lived there until he died in 1934 .
It is now under the care of the Historic Places Trust , which mounted a plaque on the street-facing back wall to remember his composition of the national anthem .
He was known for working 13-hour days and keeping accounts of such a high standard that he was accepted as a fellow of the Registered Accountants of New Zealand .
Serving in this role , he also became known as an authority on county law , sought out by the council and clerks of other regions .
He entered his composition under the pen name of `` Orpheus '' .
While in Lawrence , Woods taught with an Irish widow called Harriet Conway -LRB- neÃ Plunket -RRB- who already had two sons .
In 1884 , Woods was elected first president of the local choral society .
He was a member of many local clubs and societies .
The Advertiser sent it off with the eleven other submissions to Melbourne , where it was judged .
Singing a solo at his own wedding , Woods showed that he was also a good singer .
John Joseph Woods was a New Zealand teacher and songwriter .
One night in the winter of June 1876 , Woods read about the competition in the Saturday Advertiser .
In a later letter to A.H. Reed , he explained that the words inspired him so much he had to write music for them .
Woods was deeply involved in the affairs of the town .
Bracken did not mean for his poem to become the national anthem , and it was Woods who had always used the word `` anthem '' where Bracken called it a `` hymn '' .
Grey was very taken by the music and immediately sent a telegram to Bracken congratulating him .
When promises of reprint failed to come true , the Advertiser was forced to hand the copyright back over to Woods .
The rules of the competition meant that the copyright of the music would belong to the Saturday Advertiser , which gave the manuscript to the Dunedin-based Charles Begg & Co to publish , but a nine-month delay in sending it to a publisher was followed by two months of waiting for it to be printed .

A meringue is a type of dessert made from whipping egg whites and sugar .
They are more sure that the name meringue was first seen in 1692 , in a cookbook by FranÃ ois Massialot .
There are two English recipe books that have a recipe for meringue , but it is called `` white biskit bread '' in the book of recipes started in 1604 by Lady Elinor Fettiplace , or called `` pets '' in the manuscript of collected recipes written by Lady Rachel Fane .
The word meringue was first used in English in 1706 in an English translation of Massialot 's book .
Meringues are often flavored with vanilla and a small amount of almond or coconut extract .
Some meringue recipes also ask for cream of tartar or cornstarch to hold it together .
People do not agree whether meringue was invented in the Swiss town of Meiringen by an Italian chef named Gasparini .
Meringue is also used as a topping on other desserts , such as angel food cake , pavlova , and baked Alaska .
They are light , airy and sweet .

The Master reveals himself a few stories later , in The Glorious Dead -LRB- DWM 287-296 -RRB- .
The Master in these stories is , nevertheless , recognisably the same person .
In Character Assassin -LRB- DWM 311 -RRB- , the Delgado Master visits the Land of Fiction and steals part of the technology behind it , wiping out several nineteenth century fictional villains as he goes .
A would-be universal conqueror , the Master wants to control the universe -LRB- in The Deadly Assassin his ambitions were becoming `` the master of all matter '' , and in `` The Sound of Drums '' he acknowledges that he chose his own name -RRB- .
In 1996 , the Master was played by Eric Roberts in the TV movie .
The Master has also been featured in spin-offs of the series , which are of unclear canonicity and may not take place in the same continuity .
In `` The Sound of Drums '' -LRB- 2007 -RRB- , a flashback shows the Master at the age of eight , when as part of a Time Lord initiation ceremony he is taken before a gap in the fabric of space and time known as the Untempered Schism , from which one can see into the entire Vortex .
The Master returns in a new body and guise , that of a street preacher , in the previously mentioned Doctor Who Magazine -LRB- DWM -RRB- comic strip story The Fallen , although the Doctor does not recognize him .
The Master had survived the events of the television movie by encountering a cosmic being named Esterath in the time vortex .
Both the Doctor and the Master have been shown to be skilled hypnotists , although the Master 's capacity to dominate â `` even by stare and voice alone â `` has been shown to be far more pronounced .
The Master and the Doctor are shown to have similar levels of intelligence , and were classmates on Gallifrey .
Esterath controls the Glory , the focal point of the Omniversal spectrum which underlies all existence .
In the 2007 episode `` Utopia '' , the Doctor calls the disguised Master a genius and shows an immense admiration for his intellect before discovering who he is .
Afterwards , Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers played a decayed version of the Time Lord , until Anthony Ainley assumed the part in 1981 .
In `` Rise of the Cybermen '' , the Tenth Doctor claims that his TARDIS is the last one in existence although at the time of his saying this , he also thought he was the last Time Lord .
By the time of the new series , it is unclear whether any of the Master 's TARDISes still exist .
He remained until Doctor Whos cancellation in 1989 .
When the Master first appeared in January 1971 he was played by Roger Delgado , who continued in the role until his death in 1973 .
This is mentioned several times in different stories -LRB- The Five Doctors , The Sea Devils and Terror of the Autons -RRB- .
One of the most important of these other appearances is David A. McIntee 's `` Master trilogy '' of novels comprising The Dark Path and First Frontier in the Virgin Publishing lines and The Face of the Enemy for BBC Books , and the Doctor Who audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions , in which Geoffrey Beevers has once agian played the Master .
From December 1944 until he died two years later , Baird lived at a house in Station Road , Bexhill-on-Sea , immediately north of the station .
The old house was knocked down in 2007 .
Some of Baird 's early inventions did not work .
Although lots of inventors helped to make television , Baird was an important person and made big advances .
Later Baird made a glass razor which was did not get rusty , but it shattered .
Baird then started the Baird Television Development Company Ltd , and in 1928 it made the first transatlantic television transmission , from London to Hartsdale , New York , and the first television program for the BBC .
He went to school at Larchfield Academy in Helensburgh and then went to the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College -LRB- which later became the University of Strathclyde -RRB- ; and the University of Glasgow .
Baird died in Bexhill-on-Sea , Sussex , England on 14 June 1946 after a stroke in February 1946 .
Baird was born in Helensburgh , Dunbartonshire , Scotland .
Baird did this by making a better photoelectric cell and making the signal conditioning better .
In his twenties he tried to make diamonds by heating graphite and ruined Glasgow 's electricity supply .
In 1927 , Baird made a signal go over 438 m between London and Glasgow ; Baird sent the world 's first long-distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station .
Especially in Britain , lots of people say that Baird was the first person to make a live , moving , greyscale television picture from reflected light .
John Logie Baird was buried with his mother , father and wife in Helensburgh Cemetery , Dunbartonshire .
In geology and astronomy , the term silicate is used to denote types of rock that consist predominantly of silicate minerals .
A type of plankton known as diatoms construct their exoskeletons , known as tests , from silica .
Living things also contribute to the silicate cycle near the Earth 's surface .
On Earth , a wide variety of silicate minerals occur in an even wider range of combinations as a result of the processes that form and re-work the crust .
The tests of dead diatoms are a major constituent of deep ocean sediment
These processes include partial melting , crystallization , fractionation , metamorphism , weathering and diagenesis .
The most common silicate species consist of silicon with oxygen as the ligand . Silicate anions , with a negative net electrical charge , must have that charge balanced by other cations to make an electrically neutral compound .

The cell is now no longer useful to the virus , therefore it must find a new host .
During this time , the virus will not produce any copies , it will remain inactive until external stimuli -LRB- such as light or stress -RRB- prompts it into activation , or the redtart of the life cycle .
It is only active when reproducing within a host , using a hosts ' resources and food .
One of the ways a virus can be seen as living is that a virus needs to make more of themselves .
A hole forms in the cell membrane , then the virus particle or its genetic contents are released into the host cell , where viral reproduction may start .
Some viruses can `` hide '' inside another cell , either to defend itself against the host cell defenses or immune system , or because it is not in the best interest of the virus to make more copies at the time .
After a virus has made many copies of itself , it usually has used up the cell 's resources .
Permissibility determines how the infection will progress .
Attachment , or adsorption , occurs between the viral part and the host cell membrane .
In order for the virus to make copies and infect , it must enter cells of the host animal and use those cells ' materials .
The process by viral copies are released to find new hosts , is called shedding .
After control is taken by the virus and the environment is set for the virus to begin making copies of itself , replication occurs quickly .
It is usually only after a virus enters a host that it can gain access to cells in order to invade .
It is at this stage a distinction between susceptibility and permissibility of a host cell is made .
Next , a virus must take control of the host cell 's replication mechanisms .
This is the final stage in the viral life cycle .
In order to enter the cells , proteins found on the surface of the virus interact with proteins of the cell .
This hiding is called latency .
A virus can not survive on its own .
Viruses are near the same to living organisms , however there are differences .
Once inside a host , a virus 's main purpose is to make as many copies of itself , and infect other host cells ; everything it does is to benefit its fitness and increase the number of its offspring .
It is found in the region Pays de la Loire in the VendÃ e department in the west of France .

There is an ongoing debate over whether H. floresiensis is indeed a separate species .
Homo erectus lived lived from about 1.8 million to 70,000 years ago .
This was made possible by the evolution of locking knees and a different location of the foramen magnum -LRB- the hole in the skull where the spine enters -RRB- .
In other words , H. floresiensis share a common ancestor with modern humans , but split from the modern human lineage and followed a different evolutionary path .
A consensus on which should count as separate species and which as subspecies has not been reached yet .
Found in 2003 it has been dated to approximately 18,000 years old .
Also , less usual , as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis : there is still some discussion if it was a separate species Homo neanderthalensis , or a subspecies of H. sapiens .
A famous example of Homo erectus is Peking Man ; others were found in Asia -LRB- notably in Indonesia -RRB- , Africa , and Europe .
Then a subsequent migration within and out of Africa eventually replaced the earlier H. erectus .
H. floresiensis is intriguing both for its size and its age . It is a concrete example of a recent species of the genus Homo that shows derived traits not shared with modern humans .
The main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30 years of age .
One line of attack on H. floresiensis is that it was found with tools only associated with H. sapiens .
Many paleoanthropologists are now using the term Homo ergaster for the non-Asian forms of this group . They reserve H. erectus only for those fossils found in the Asian region that meet certain requirements -LRB- as to skeleton and skull -RRB- which differ slightly from ergaster .
In addition H. erectus was the first human ancestor to walk truly upright .
H. sapiens idaltu , from Ethiopia , about 160,000 years ago , is a proposed subspecies .
In this book , Darwin wrote about the idea of evolution in general , rather than the evolution of humans . Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history , was all Darwin wrote on the subject .
Some scientists believe that H. floresiensis was a modern H. sapiens suffering from pathological dwarfism .
Modern humans who live on Flores , the island where the skeleton was found , are pygmies .
Homo floresiensis , which lived about 100,000 â `` 12,000 years ago has been nicknamed hobbit for its small size .
Also , the specimen exhibited short canine teeth , and the position of the foramen magnum was evidence of bipedal locomotion .
Although the brain was small -LRB- 410 cmÂ -RRB- , its shape was rounded , unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas , and more like a modern human brain .
Today , there is only one species in the genus : Homo sapiens .
These adapted traits are a very small component of the Homo sapiens genome and include such outward `` racial '' characteristics as skin color and nose form in addition to internal characteristics such as the ability to breathe more efficiently in high altitudes .
The remains were a remarkably well-preserved tiny skull and a cast of the inside of the individual 's skull .
Homo erectus was first discovered on the island of Java in Indonesia , in 1891 .
Between 400,000 years ago and the second warm period in the Middle Pleistocene , around 250,000 years ago , its skull grew and more sophisticated technologies based on stone tools developed . One possibility is that a transition between H. erectus to H. sapiens occurred .
called Homo ergaster , or Homo erectus ergaster ' .
In 1924 , Raymond Dart described Australopithecus africanus .
The australopithecines were originally classified as either gracile or robust .
It was not until the 1920s that hominid fossils were discovered in Africa .
The discoverer , Eugene Dubois originally called it Pithecanthropus erectus based on its morphology that he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and apes .
While the debate remains unsettled , evidence from mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomal DNA sequencing indicates that little or no gene flow occurred between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens , and , therefore , the two were separate species .
Homo sapiens has lived from about 250,000 years ago to the present .
Both australopithecines and Homo sapiens are part of the tribe Hominini , but recent data has brought into doubt the position of A. africanus as a direct ancestor of modern humans ; it may well have been a cousin .
This list is in chronological order by genus .
The evidence of Java Man suggests there was an initial migration of H. erectus out of Africa . Then , much later , a further development of H. sapiens from H. erectus in Africa .
In the Early Pleistocene , 1.5 â `` 1 mya , in Africa , Asia , and Europe , presumably , some populations of Homo habilis evolved larger brains and made more elaborate stone tools ; these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species , H. erectus .
The DNA of individuals is more alike than usual for most species . This may have resulted from their relatively recent evolution or from the Toba catastrophe .
They may have used fire to cook their meat .
All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung baby was a bipedal human ancestor , a transitional form between apes and humans .
In some cases this is because there are very few fossils , in other cases it is due to the slight differences used to classify species in the Homo genus .
Even some of Darwin 's supporters -LRB- such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell -RRB- did not like the idea that human beings have evolved their impressive mental capacities and moral sensibilities through natural selection .
In 1997 , Dr. Mark Stoneking , then an associate professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University , stated : `` These results -LRB- based on mitochondrial DNA extracted from Neanderthal bone -RRB- indicate that Neanderthals did not contribute mitochondrial DNA to modern humansâ Neanderthals are not our ancestors . ''
The australopithecines are now thought to be immediate ancestors of the genus Homo , the group to which modern humans belong .
The Giant Armadillo -LRB- Priodontes maximus -RRB- , colloquially Tatou , Ocarro , Tatu-canastra or TatÃ Carreta , is the largest living species of armadillo .
It was once found widely throughout the tropical forests of eastern South America and now ranges throughout varied habitat as far south as northern Argentina .

In 2006 , Daniel Harding became the co-principal guest conductor together with Michael Tilson Thomas .
The LSO was the first British orchestra to play overseas when it went to Paris in 1906 .
Hearst sailed to Cuba , when the invasion began , as a war correspondent , providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting .
The most famous example of the exaggeration is the story , which probably is not actually true , that artist Frederic Remington sent Hearst a telegram to tell him that not much was going on in Cuba and `` There will be no war . ''
The island was in a bad economic depression , and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler , sent to crush the rebellion , herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps leading hundreds of Cubans to their deaths .
Leaping Higher , Higher , Higher , With Desperate Desire .
Hearst could be hyperbolic in his crime coverage ; one of his early stories , about a `` band of murderers , '' attacked the police for forcing Examiner reporters to do their work for them .
Charles Anderson Dana Charles Dana , editor of the New York Sun , attacked The World and said Pulitzer was `` deficient in judgment and in staying power . ''
Pulitzer , although he did not have Hearst 's resources , kept the story on his front page .
Just two years after Pulitzer took it over , the World sold more copies than any other newspaper in New York . Part of this was because he was connected to the Democratic Party .
Hearst then hired many people who were working for World in 1896 .
The most important part of this fight was from 1895 to about 1898 .
Hearst did not know of Bierce 's column and claimed to have pulled Brisbane 's after it ran in a first edition , but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life and all but destroyed his dream to be president .
These were Joseph Pulitzer 's and the New York World and William Randolph Hearst with the New York Journal .
Having fought for a fight for two years , Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came : A week after the United States declared war on Spain , he ran `` How do you like the Journal 's war ? ''
Arrival of the Unfortunate Victims on the Morning 's Train â '' A History of Hotel del Monte â '' The Plans for Rebuilding the Celebrated Hostelry â '' Particulars and Supposed Origin of the Fire .
He later ran for mayor and governor and even tried to get nominated for president , but his reputation was hurt in 1901 after columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that suggested that President William McKinley be assassinated .
on his front page .
Both were Democratic , both took the side of organized labor and immigrants -LRB- unlike publishers like the New York Tribune 's Whitelaw Reid , who blamed their poverty on moral defects -RRB- , and both spent a lot of money making their Sunday publications , which were like weekly magazines , going beyond just daily journalism .
You furnish the pictures and I 'll furnish the war . ''
Pulitzer believed that newspapers were important and had a duty to make society better , and he tried to do this with his newspaper .
But Hearst did want the United States to go to war after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in 1895 .
The Journal and the World were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers , and their stories did not catch people 's attention outside New York City .
Joseph Pulitzer bought the New York World in 1883 after making the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the biggest daily newspaper in that city .
While the stories were probably not very accurate , the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not expect , or necessarily want , his stories to be pure nonfiction .
They Leap Madly Upon the Splendid Pleasure Palace by the Bay of Monterey , Encircling Del Monte in Their Ravenous Embrace From Pinnacle to Foundation .
The story -LRB- a version of which appears in the Hearst-inspired Orson Welles film Citizen Kane -RRB- first showed up in the memoirs of reporter James Creelman in 1901 , and there is no other source for it .
However , most of Americans did not live in New York City , and the decision makers who did live there probably read less sensationalist newspapers like the Times , The Sun or the Post .
Historian Michael Robertson has said that `` Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact-based reporting , opinion and literature . ''
Hearst was a well-known Democrat who promoted William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896 and 1900 -LRB- Bryan did not win either election -RRB- .
Pulitzer tried to make the New York World fun to read , and filled his paper with pictures , games and contests that brought in new readers .
Hearst read the World while studying at Harvard University and decided to try to make the Examiner as bright as Pulitzer 's paper .
William Randolph Hearst , a mining heir who bought the San Francisco Examiner from his father in 1887 , noticed what Pulitzer was doing .
In one story , Examiner reporter Winifred Black went into a San Francisco hospital as a patient and discovered that the women there were treated with `` gross cruelty . ''
Yellow journalism or the yellow press is a type of journalism that does not report much real news with facts . It uses shocking headlines that catch people 's attention to sell more newspapers .
Hearst responded `` Please remain .
When Hearst hired Outcault away , Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue drawing the strip with his characters , giving the city two Yellow Kids .
and `` Screaming for Mercy . ''
The Examiner Sends a Special Train to Monterey to Gather Full Details of the Terrible Disaster .
While there were many sensational stories in the New York World , they were by no means the only stories , or even the biggest ones .
When McKinley was shot on September 6 , 1901 , critics accused Hearst 's Yellow Journalism of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed .
Hogan 's Alley , a comic strip about a bald child in a yellow nightshirt -LRB- nicknamed The Yellow Kid -RRB- , became very popular when cartoonist Richard F. Outcault began drawing it in the World in early 1896 .
says that yellow press newspapers have several columns and front-page headlines about different types of news , such as sports and scandals , using bold layouts -LRB- with large illustrations and perhaps color -RRB- , and stories reported using sources that do n't share their names .
Their Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages , and some think that the term yellow journalism originated there , while as noted above , the New York Press left the term it invented undefined .
Crime stories filled many of the pages , with headlines like `` Was He a Suicide ? ''
While most sources say that Hearst simply offered more money , Pulitzer â '' who had grown more abusive to his employees â '' had become a very difficult man to work for , and many World employees were willing to switch newspapers just to get away from him .
Both papers were accused of sensationalizing the news -LRB- making it seem much more important than it really was -RRB- in order to sell more newspapers , although the newspapers did serious reporting as well .
The New York Press came up with the term `` yellow kid journalism '' in early 1897 after a then-popular comic strip to talk about the newspapers of Pulitzer and Hearst , which both published versions of it during a circulation war .
While he was in charge , the Examiner gave 24 percent of its space to crime , presenting the stories as morality plays , and put adultery and `` nudity '' -LRB- by 19th century standards -RRB- on the front page .
Also , journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism mostly only happened in New York City , and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not do it .
Also , Pulitzer only charged readers two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information -LRB- the only other two cent paper in the city was never longer than four pages -RRB- .
In fact , President William McKinley never read the Journal , and newspapers like the Tribune and the New York Evening Post .
Pulitzer and Hearst are often credited -LRB- or blamed -RRB- for drawing the nation into the Spanish-American War with their sensationalism .
By the time of his death in 1911 , the World was a widely-respected publication , and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931 .
Pulitzer , haunted by what had happened , '' returned the World to its crusading roots as the new century dawned .
But while doing these things , the Examiner also increased its space for international news , and sent reporters out to uncover corruption and inefficiency in the city government .
The use of `` yellow journalism '' as a term for over-the-top sensationalism in the U.S. apparently started with more serious newspapers commenting how far `` the Yellow Kid papers '' went .
The Magnificent Hotel and Its Rich Adornments Now a Smoldering heap of Ashes .
The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the story was printed .
A month after Hearst took over the paper , the Examiner ran this headline about a hotel fire : HUNGRY , FRANTIC FLAMES .
After noticing what Pulitzer had done by keeping his newspaper at two cents , Hearst made the Journal 's only cost one cent , while providing as much information as rival newspapers .
With the Examiner having success by the early 1890s , Hearst began looking for a New York newspaper to buy , and bought the New York Journal in 1895 , a newspaper that sold for oen penny which Pulitzer 's brother Albert had sold to a Cincinnati publisher the year before .

Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for writing about how Spain treated Cuba , arguing , '' no true history of the war ... can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish-American war was due to the enterprise and tenacity of yellow journalists , many of whom lie in unremembered graves . ''
The term was often used to talk about some large New York City newspapers around 1900 as they fought to get more readers than the other newspapers .
Running Madly Riotous Through Cornice , Archway and Facade .
This worked , and as the Journal 's had 150,000 people subscribe to it , Pulitzer cut his price to a penny , hoping to make Hearst -LRB- who was subsidized by his family 's fortune -RRB- run out of money .
Ervin Wardman , publisher of the New York Herald -LRB- which was not `` yellow journalism '' -RRB- came up with the term .

According to Dr. S.K. Kellet-Smith , `` bur '' refers to a storehouse - `` Burhou is just the place where a fisherman would place a depository for his gear '' .
The soil is thin , and spray often goes right over the island , so the soil is very salty .
The island has many puffins and some storm petrels .
`` Between Ortac , Verte TÃ te and Burhou Island , are scattered many dangerous rocks , and ledges among which the streams run with great velocity . ''

Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes :
The calculated interval has fixed endpoints , where Î 1\/4 might be in between -LRB- or not -RRB- .
In statistics , a claim to 95 % confidence simply means that the researcher has seen something occur that only happens one time in twenty or less .
People may speak about the `` 95 % confidence interval '' .
This does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter Î 1\/4 in the calculated interval .
This might be interpreted as : with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter Î 1\/4 between the stochastic endpoints
A machine fills cups with margarine . For the example , the machine is adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250 g of margarine .
The sample shows actual weights x1 , ... , x25 , with mean :
The term confidence has a different meaning in statistics , than it has in common use . This often confuses people and is one of the critiques to the concept of confidence intervals : If they are used by other people than statisticians , the term confidence is misleading .
We can not say : `` with probability -LRB- 1 â ' Î -RRB- the parameter Î 1\/4 lies in the confidence interval . '' We only know that by repetition in 100 -LRB- 1 â ' Î -RRB- % of the cases Î 1\/4 will be in the calculated interval .
The confidence one can therefore have that any of the study 's positive conclusions are correct is only about 32 % , well below the 95 % the researchers have set as their standard of acceptance .
We can not say : `` with probability -LRB- 1 â ' Î -RRB- the parameter Î 1\/4 lies in the confidence interval . ''
Similarly , the finding of a statistical link at 95 % confidence is not proof , nor even very good evidence , that there is any real connection between the things linked .
Each test has a 5 % chance of producing a false positive , so such a study will produce 3 false positives about two times in three .
The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean Î 1\/4 .
There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 of the sample mean within which , if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range , the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual .
We only know that by repetition in 100 -LRB- 1 â ' Î -RRB- % of the cases Î 1\/4 will be in the calculated interval .
We take 1 Î = 0.95 .
When a study involves multiple statistical tests , some laymen assume that the confidence associated with each test is the confidence one should have in the results of the study itself .
As the machine can not fill every cup with exactly 250 g , the content added to individual cups shows some variation , and is considered a random variable X. This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250 g , with a standard deviation of 2.5 g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated , a sample of n = 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random and the cups are weighed .
How do we calculate such an interval ?
Hence it is possible to find numbers â ' z and z , independent of Î 1\/4 , where Z lies in between with probability 1 â ' Î , a measure of how confident we want to be .
We 'll never know ; we are stuck with our interval .
In common usage , a claim to 95 % confidence in something is normally taken as indicating virtual certainty .
In 100 Î % of the cases however it does not .
A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250g .
That 's why we say : `` with confidence level 100 -LRB- 1 â ' Î -RRB- % , Î 1\/4 lies in the confidence interval . ''
Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1 .
In fact , the results of all the statistical tests done during a study must be judged as a whole in order to determine what confidence one may place in the positive links it produces .
In 95 % of the cases Î 1\/4 will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean , but in 5 % of the cases it will not be .
The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula .
If we randomly choose one realisation , the probability is 95 % we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter ; however we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one .
The confidence interval is always given together with the confidence level .
As the desired value 250 of Î 1\/4 is within the resulted confidence interval , there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated .
The weights of margarine are X1 , ... , X25 , a random sample from X.
The appropriate estimator is the sample mean :
And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens .
Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter Î 1\/4 .
If we take another sample of 25 cups , we could easily expect to find values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams .
dependent on the parameter Î 1\/4 to be estimated , but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter Î 1\/4 .
To get an impression of the expectation Î 1\/4 , it is sufficient to give an estimate .
If one were to roll two dice and get double six -LRB- which happens 1\/36th of the time , or about 3 % -RRB- , few would claim this as proof that the dice were fixed , although statistically speaking one could have 97 % confidence that they were .
The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample , so they are statistics , functions of the sample X1 , ... , X25 and hence random variables themselves .
Every time the measurements are repeated , there will be another value for the mean of the sample .
For example , say a study is conducted which involves 40 statistical tests at 95 % confidence , and which produces 3 positive results .
From 486 BC , each playwright also submitted a comedy .
Satyr plays dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies , but in a purely comedic manner .
By the end of the 5th century BC , around the time of the Peloponnesian War , the skÃ nÃ , the back wall , was two stories high .
The theaters were built on a very large scale to accommodate the large number of people on stage , as well as the large number of people in the audience , up to fourteen thousand .
Phrynichus was the first poet known to use a historical subject -- his Fall of Miletus , 493 , told the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians .
They were tall arches that opened onto the orchestra , through which the performers entered .
Some theaters also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion .
Some think early Greek religion and theater were influenced by Central Asian shamanistic practices .
The power of Athens declined following its defeat in the Peloponnesian War against the Spartans .
The only playwright from the period whose work has survived is Menander .
An actor could appear and reappear in different roles , since the audience did not identify the actor with one character .
Most of the evidence comes from a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC which depict actors preparing for a Satyr play .
Theatre was part of a festival called the Dionysia , which honored the god Dionysus .
The theater of ancient Greece was at its best from 550 to 220 BC .
Greek theaters also had entrances for the actors and chorus members called parodoi .
Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors .
Tragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres , and no plays ever merged aspects of the two .
The proskenion -LRB- `` in front of the scene '' -RRB- was columned , and was similar to the modern day proscenium .
The dramatic performances were important to the Athenians â `` this is made clear by the Dionysian festival .
Eli Rozik points out that the shaman can be seen as an early type of actor influencing the rituals of early Greek theater .
By Thespis ' time the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots .
The performance space was a simple semi-circular space , the orchestra , where the chorus danced and sang .
The orchestra was on a flattened terrace at the foot of a hill , the slope of which produced a natural theatron , -LRB- watching place -RRB- .
Thespis 's contribution to drama is unclear , but his name is remembered in the common term for performerâ '' a ` thespian ' .
In 465 BC , the playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall , which hung or stood behind the orchestra , which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes .
Actors ' voices needed to be heard throughout the theater , including the very top row of seats .
They invented the genres of tragedy -LRB- late 6th century BC -RRB- , comedy -LRB- 486 BC -RRB- and satyr plays .
It was known as the skÃ nÃ -LRB- scene -RRB- .
He is also thought to be the first to use female characters -LRB- though not female performers -RRB- .
In a large open-air theater , like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens , the masks brought the characters ' face closer to the audience , as they had exaggerated features and expressions .
The festival was created roughly around 508 BC .
In 425 BC a stone scene wall , called a paraskenia , became a common supplement to skÃ nÃ in the theaters .
Aristotle claimed that Aeschylus added the second actor , and that Sophocles introduced the third .
After the Great Destruction of Athens by the Persian Empire in 480 BC , the town and acropolis were rebuilt , and theater became an even more major part of Athenian culture and civic pride .
This was organized perhaps to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica . These had been recently created by Cleisthenes , who founded Greek democracy .
The main Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but ` New Comedy ' , comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens .
Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote their way of life .
No physical evidence survived : the masks were made of organic materials . They were not considered permanent objects , and were dedicated to the altar of Dionysus after performances .
However , as they were written over a century after the Athenian Golden Age , it is not known whether dramatists such as Sophocles and Euripides would have thought about their plays in the same terms .
The statesman Solon is said to have created poems in which characters speak with their own voice . Spoken recitations , known as rhapsodes , of Homer 's epics were popular in festivals before 534 BC .
The Greeks ' understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art .
Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality , Greek theater continued into the Hellenistic period -LRB- the period following Alexander the Great 's conquests in the fourth century BC -RRB- .
Each submitted three tragedies , plus a satyr play -LRB- a comic , burlesque version of a mythological subject -RRB- .
The centre-piece was the competition between three tragic playwrights at the Theatre of Dionysus , twice a year .
Worn by the chorus , the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity , a sort of multi-voiced persona or single organism .
A large number of Orphic graffiti discovered in Olbia seems to show that the colony was a major point of contact .
It had become a narrative , ballad-like genre .
From that time on , the theater started performing old tragedies again .
Later , the term `` theater '' came to be applied to the whole area of theatron , orchestra , and skenÃ -LRB- scene -RRB- .
One of New Comedy 's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy , an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of Plautus and Terence .
Until the Hellenistic period , all tragedies were unique pieces written in honor of Dionysus and played only once , so that today we only have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when repetition of old tragedies became fashion .
Also , they could show a change in a characterâ s appearance , for example , Oedipus after blinding himself . p70 Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play , such as The Furies in Aeschylusâ Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripidesâ The Bacchae .

One of the most magnificent ones is the marble tomb of Henry II , the founder of the cathedral , and his wife , the empress Cunigunde . It took the famous sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider 14 years to carve : between 1499 and 1513 .
The sculptor has carved his name on the statue .
During the cathedralâ s history people have often made up stories about who he was .
It has a choir at both ends .
This symbolizes the Holy Roman Empire .
The Nazis thought he was a knight who symbolized German perfection , looking towards the east for new lands to conquer .
Every year about 40 concerts are given in the cathedral .
This does not tell us who he was .
The west chancel is dedicated to St. Peter symbolizing the Pope .
He made it when he was about 80 years old .
The cathedral was founded in 1004 by the emperor Henry II , and was consecration in 1012 .
The Romantics thought he was a German emperor from the Hohenstaufen family .
The cathedral first had an organ in 1415 .
He was the local bishop before he became Pope , but he died in 1047 after having been pope for only twelve months .
This meant that his father was never paid for his beautiful work , which was soon moved to Bamberg .
This is why we can see several styles in different parts of the cathedral , particularly Romaneque and Gothic styles .
The one that was built in 1868 gave many problems and had to be rebuilt five years later , but it was kept until 1940 because it made a nice sound .
Between these two styles is the Transitional style , and this is the way the nave was built .
All the organs during the cathedralâ s history were built against the north wall because the sound was best there .
The carvings round the side tell of various episodes in the lives of the imperial couple .
There are lots of sculptures in the cathedral .
The knight on the statue does not , in fact , look east at all .
During the next two centuries it was burnt down twice .
Bamberg Cathedral is the only place in Germany where a pope is buried . He was Pope Clement II .
People have tried to guess for years who this knight on horseback really was .
The organ that we see in the cathedral today was built in 1976 by the organ builder Rieger .
The east chancel is dedicated to St. George .
The building we now see is a late Romanesque building with four big towers .
Modern technology has made it possible for us to know what the original colors were , and this has helped scientists to identify him .
The cathedral is under the administration of the Roman Catholic Church and is the seat of the Archbishop of Bamberg .
This was Nazi propaganda .
The tomb is slightly higher than floor level because below there is a crypt .
His son asked him to build it .
It is now thought that he was probably the 13th century Hungarian king Stephen I. .
His son was a Carmelite prior in the nearby city of NÃ 1\/4 rnberg .
The cathedral is about 94 m long , 28 m broad , 26 m high , and the four towers are each about 81 m high .

This mineral 's metallic lustre and pale-to-normal , brass-yellow color have earned it the nickname fool 's gold because of its resemblance to gold .
Pyrite is the most common of the sulphide minerals .
By Georgius Agricola 's time , the term had become a generic term for all of the sulphide minerals .
In ancient Roman times , this name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when struck against steel ; Pliny the Elder described one of them as being brassy , almost certainly a reference to what we now call pyrite .
Pyrite is usually found associated with other sulphides or oxides in quartz veins , sedimentary rock , and metamorphic rock , as well as in coal beds , and as a replacement mineral in fossils .
The mineral pyrite , or iron pyrite , is an iron sulfide with the formula FeS2 .
Despite being nicknamed fool 's gold , pyrite is sometimes found in association with small quantities of gold .
It can also refer to the business given by a regular customer , and the guardianship of saints .

Hildesheim is one of the oldest cities in North Germany . The city may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the Innerste ford , where it was an important market on the Hellweg trade route .
When Hildesheim got city rights in 1249 , it was one of the biggest cities in Northern Germany .
26.8 % of the houses had no damage .
The first market place was laid out around Saint Andrew 's Church .
As in many cities , priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing , and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings .
The current market place of Hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had about 5,000 people living there .
Originally the market was held on a street called Old Market -LRB- Alter Markt -RRB- , which still exists today .
Fortunately , most of the major churches , two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites , were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war .
It can be reached from Autobahn A7 , which links Kassel , GÃ ttingen and Hannover .

The shanks of the legs were gray other than the long hind wing feathers , and the feet and toes were black .
The coverts -LRB- shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers -RRB- were gray , contrasting the mainly white main wings .
By studying the melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds , the scientists were able to map the colors and patterning present on Anchiornis when it was alive .
Long downy feathers covered almost the entire head and neck , torso , upper legs , and the first half of the tail .
The larger coverts of the wing were also white with gray or black tips , forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing .
Anchiornis also had a more avian wrist than other non-avialan theropods .
Also , Anchiornis had long legs , usually an indication of a strong runner . However , the extensive leg feathers indicate that long legs may be an vestigial trait , because running animals tend to have reduced , not increased , hair or feathers on their legs .
The forewing of Anchiornis was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers .
The forelimbs of Anchiornis were also very long , unusual among troodontids -LRB- which tend to be short-armed -RRB- but similar to dromaeosaurids and early birds , emphasizing its basal -LRB- ` primitive ' -RRB- position among dinobirds .
Anchiornis has long hind legs , suggesting a fast-running lifestyle .
This is similar to Archaeopteryx ; long forelimbs are necessary for flight .
While the first specimen of Anchiornis preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body , the well-preserved second specimen showed nearly complete feather preservation , allowing researchers to identify the structure of the feathers and how they were distributed .
Two types of simpler , downy -LRB- plumaceous -RRB- feathers covered the rest of the body , as in Sinornithosaurus .
The hind wings of Anchiornis were also shorter than those of Microraptor , and were made up of 12 â `` 13 flight feathers anchored to the tibia -LRB- lower leg -RRB- and 10 â `` 11 to the metatarsus -LRB- upper foot -RRB- .
Like many modern birds , Anchiornis exhibited a complex pattern of coloration with different colors in speckled patterns across the body and wings , or `` within - and among-feather plumage coloration '' .
In 2010 , a team examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well-preserved Anchiornis specimen to survey the distribution of melanosomes , the pigment cells that give feathers their color .
The authors first thought that Anchiornis could fly or glide .
Anchiornis -LRB- ` near bird ' -RRB- is a genus of small , feathered , troodontid dinosaurs .
However , the legs and even feet and toes of Anchiornis were covered in feathers , making it unlikely that Anchiornis was a capable ground runner .
Unlike Microraptor , the primary feathers in Anchiornis were about as long as the secondaries and formed a more rounded wing , with curved but symmetrical central vanes , a small and thin relative size , and rounded tips , all indicating poorer aerodynamic ability compared to its later relative .
Anchiornis huxleyi is named in honor of Thomas Henry Huxley , the first to propose a close evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs .
These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing -LRB- primary feather coverts -RRB- but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing -LRB- secondary coverts -RRB- .
Also unlike Microraptor , the hind wing feathers were longest closer to the body , with the foot feathers being short and directed downward , almost perpendicular to the foot bones .
Anchiornis is notable for its long forelimbs , which were 80 % of the total length of the hind limbs .
In modern birds , such color patterning is used in communication and display , either to members of the same species -LRB- e.g. for mating or territorial threat display -RRB- or to threaten and warn off competing or predatory species .
The fore and hind wing feathers were white with black tips .
However , further finds showed that the wings of Anchiornis , while well-developed , were short when compared to later species like Microraptor , with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded , symmetrical tips , unlike the pointed , aerodynamically proportioned feathers of Microraptor .
However , in Anchiornis , the longest wing feathers anchored near the wrist , making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded , less flight-adapted profile .
The crown of head feathers was mainly reddish with a gray base and front , and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers .
Unlike any other known Mesozoic dinosaur , the feet of Anchiornis -LRB- except for the claws -RRB- were completely covered in feathers -LRB- much shorter than the ones making up the hind wing -RRB- .
Most of the body feathers of Anchiornis were gray and black .
Anchiornis fossils have been found in Liaoning , China , dating to the mid-late Jurassic period , 160 to 155 million years ago .
In Microraptor and Archaeopteryx , the longest forewing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing , making the wings appear long , narrow , and pointed .
As in other early birds , such as Microraptor , Anchiornis had large wings , made up of flight feathers attached to the arm and hand -LRB- as in modern birds -RRB- as well as flight feathers on the hind legs , forming an arrangement of fore and hind wings .
The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers -LRB- rectrices -RRB- .

According to SAG 's Mission Statement , the Guild was created to negotiate and enforce reasonable salaries , benefits , and working conditions for its performers ; collect compensation for exploitation of recorded performances by its members , and provide protection against unauthorized use of those performances ; and preserve and expand work opportunities for its members .
The Screen Actors Guild -LRB- SAG -RRB- is an American labor union representing over 200,000 film and television principal performers and background performers worldwide .
These contracts were notorious for allowing the studios to dictate the public and private lives of the performers who signed them , and most did not have provisions to allow the performer to end the deal .
Since 1995 , the guild has annually awarded the Screen Actors Guild Awards , which are considered an indicator of success at the Academy Awards .
The Guild was founded in 1933 in an effort to end exploitation of actors in Hollywood who were being forced into oppressive multi-year contracts with the major movie studios that did not include restrictions on work hours or minimum rest periods , and often had clauses that automatically renewed at the studios ' discretion .
In addition to its main offices in Hollywood , SAG also maintains local branches in several major US cities , including : Atlanta , Boston , Chicago , Dallas , Denver , Detroit , Honolulu , Houston , Las Vegas , Miami , Nashville , New York City , Philadelphia , Phoenix , Portland , Salt Lake City , San Diego , San Francisco , Seattle , and Washington DC .

Ustashe 's unseen cruelty and savagery applied against Serbs and Jews even prompted the German command to demand that FrancetiÄ , as the commander of the 1st Brigade Black Legion , be dismissed . PaveliÄ defied and promoted FrancetiÄ to commander of all Ustashe field formations .
He stayed in OtoÄ ac for a short time before emigrating to Italy in March 1933 .
After the assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia he was interned on Sardinia by Mussolini at the request of the Yugoslav government .
Killings , arrests , and deportation of Serbs and Jews was a regular duty of FrancetiÄ 's henchmen - based and justified by the official Ustashe policy which demanded total extermination of Jews and murder , expulsion , and conversion to the Roman Catholicism of Serb population in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Severely wounded , he was taken to NOVJ General Staff Hospital where Partisan surgeons attempted to save his life in order to exchange him for inmates of UstaÅ e camps and prisons , but failed .

Relationships within the family are poorly understood , but Adasaurus seems to be a member of the subfamily Dromaeosaurinae , along with the Mongolian Achillobator and several North American species , including Utahraptor and Dromaeosaurus , after which the whole family is named .
The holotype is an incomplete skull associated with some bones of the skeleton , including all three bones of the pelvis .
The age of the Nemegt , like most of Mongolia 's Late Cretaceous sediments , is not known for certain , but it is commonly thought to belong to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period .
The name also includes the Greek word sauros meaning ` lizard ' , the most common suffix used in dinosaur names .
Two specimens of Adasaurus have been found , both from the Nemegt Formation of Bayankhongor Province in Mongolia .
It was a small carnivore , with a large , sickle-shaped claw on the second toe of each hind foot .
Both genus and species were named and described in 1983 by famous Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold .
Therefore the Nemegt was deposited somewhere between 74 and 65 million years ago .
There is one species -LRB- A. mongoliensis -RRB- , named after the country of Mongolia , where the fossil was found .
Other dromaeosaurids include Deinonychus , Velociraptor , Microraptor , and Buitreraptor .
Adasaurus is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period . It lived in what is now Central Asia .

Both specimens are currently in the collection of the Mongolian Geological Institute in Ulaanbaatar , Mongolia .
Adasaurus is a member of Dromaeosauridae , a theropod family thought to be very closely related to birds .
The second specimen , also described in the original paper , consists of the back end of another skeleton , including the hindlimbs .
Other dinosaurs found in this formation include Tarbosaurus , Anserimimus , and Saurolophus .

Stresemann hoped for an escalation of the Polish crisis , which would enable Germany to regain territories ceded to Poland after World War I , and he wanted Germany to gain a larger market for its products there .
The Treaty of Berlin signed in April 1926 reaffirmed and strengthened the Rapallo Treaty of 1922 .
Stresemann remained as Foreign Minister in the government of his successor , Centrist Wilhelm Marx .
His massive gravesite is situated in Berlin 's Luisenstadt Cemetery at SÃ 1\/4 dstern in Kreuzberg , and includes work by the German sculptor Hugo Lederer .
On the third day of negotiations Stresemann explained Germany 's demands to the French Foreign Secretary , Aristide Briand .
In the session of the League of Nations on 15 December 1928 in Lugano Stresemann formulated a furious charge against Poland because of these crimes which were well known to the League of Nations .
Stresemann said of this speech : `` He was inspired in that hour by God to say what was felt by the German people .
Later that year he lost both his Reichstag and town council seats .
When the Allies ' peace terms became known , Constantin Fehrenbach denounced them and claimed `` the will to break the chains of slavery would be implanted '' into a generation of Germans .
He remained foreign minister for the rest of his life in eight successive governments ranging from the centre-right to the centre-left .
He then gathered most of the right wing of the old National Liberal Party into the German People 's Party -LRB- , DVP -RRB- , with himself as chairman .
The DVP was at first seen , along with the German National People 's Party , as part of the `` national opposition '' to the Weimar Republic , particularly for its grudging acceptance of democracy and its attitude towards the Freikorps and the Kapp Putsch in 1920 .
He said to Nikolay Krestinsky in June 1925 , as recorded in his diary : `` I had said I would not come to conclude a treaty with Russia so long as our political situation in the other direction was not cleared up , as I wanted to answer the question whether we had a treaty with Russia in the negative '' .
There was in that sense a kind of uplifting grandeur .
He was exempted from war service due to poor health .
As Foreign Minister , Stresemann had numerous achievements .
In an essay written when he left school , hewrote that he would have enjoyed becoming a teacher , but he would only have been qualified to teach languages or the natural sciences , which were not his primary areas of interest .
Gustav Stresemann 's success owed much to his friendly personal character and his willingness to change .
Stresemann had a close relationship with Herbert Hoover , who was Secretary of Commerce in 1921-28 and President from 1929 .
He entered the University of Berlin in 1897 to study political economy .
Stresemann negotiated the Locarno Treaties with Britain , France , Italy , and Belgium .
He returned to business and founded the German-American Economic Association .
Hans Luther , who was the current finance minister , ended this disastrous process by introducing a new currency , the Rentenmark , which reassured the people that the democratic system was willing and able to solve urgent problems .
Stresemann was not willing to conclude a similar treaty with Poland : `` There will be no Locarno of the east '' he said .
So Stresemann refused to engage in any international cooperation that would have `` prematurely '' restabilized the Polish economy .
Since Germany was no longer able to pay the striking workers , more and more money was printed , which finally led to hyperinflation .
He completed his studies in January 1901 , submitting a thesis on the bottled beer industry in Berlin , which received a relatively high grade .
Stresemann briefly joined the German Democratic Party after the war , but was expelled for his association with the right wing .
Stresemann was not , however , in any sense pro-French .
His strategy for this was to forge an economic alliance with the United States .
Though he had initially worked in trade associations , Stresemann soon became a leader of the National Liberal Party in Saxony .
The conservative opposition criticized him for his supporting the republic and fulfilling too willingly the demands of the Western powers .
Stresemann 's sudden and premature death , as well as the death of his `` pragmatic moderate '' French counterpart Aristide Briand in 1932 , and the assassination of Briand 's successor Louis Barthou in 1934 , left a vacuum in European statesmanship that further tilted the slippery slope towards World War II .
The reason were atrocities against the German minority in the former German territories committed by or tolerated by the Polish government , see : and Hermann Rauschning .
In 1907 , he was elected to the Reichstag , where he soon became a close associate of party chairman Ernst Bassermann .
The Dawes and Young plans were the result of this strategy .
The chairman Aristide Briand , French foreign minister , concluded the session after this speech with the words : `` The League of Nations must never break the sacred support of the minority-rights . ''
Stresemann wrote to the Crown Prince : `` All the questions which to-day preoccupy the German people can be transformed into as many vexations for the Entente by a skilful orator before the League of Nations '' .
In the so-called year of crises -LRB- 1923 -RRB- he showed strength by calling-off the popular peaceful resistance at the Ruhr .
Stresemann was an excellent student , especially in German literature and poetry .
By late 1920 , Stresemann gradually moved to cooperation with the parties of the left and center -- possibly in reaction to political murders like that of Walther Rathenau .
Germany 's economic recovery was thus in the interests of the U.S. , and gave the U.S. an incentive to help Germany escape from the reparations burden .
Gustav Stresemann -LRB- 10 May 1878 -- 3 October 1929 -RRB- was a German liberal politician who was Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Germany during the Weimar Republic .
It renounced the use of violence to resolve international conflicts .
The Treaties were signed in October 1925 at Locarno .
The most noted was Briand , with whom he shared the Peace Prize .
His words , spoken under Fichte 's portrait , the final words of which merged into â Deutschland , Deutschland Ã 1\/4 ber allesâ , made it an unforgettably solemn hour .
Today , he is generally considered one of the most important leaders of Germany and a staunch supporter of democracy in the fragile Weimar Republic .
At that time he was also a member of Friedrich Naumann 's National-Social Association .
Stresemann was co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926 for these achievements .
In 1925 , when he first proposed an agreement with France , he made it clear that in doing so he intended to `` gain a free hand to secure a peaceful change of the borders in the East and -LRB- ... -RRB- concentrate on a later incorporation of German territories in the East '' .
However , some of his moves - like his refusal to deal firmly with culprits of the Beer Hall Putsch - alienated the Social Democrats .
However , he felt that trying to fulfill the treaty 's terms was the only way Germany could demonstrate that the reparations bill was truly beyond its capacity .
He is noted as one of the first to see European economic integration .
Arguably , his most notable achievement was reconciliation between Germany and France , for which he and Aristide Briand received the Peace Prize .
Moreover he never excluded the use of force to regain the eastern territories of Germany which had come under Polish control as a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles .
However , his support of more social-welfare programmess was not popular with some of the party 's more conservative members , and he lost his post in the party 's executive committee in 1912 .
His first act was to attempt to restore the old Entente through a three-power alliance of England , France and Belgium , directed against Germany .
In these early writings , he combined liberalism with nationalism .
He also wished to recover the Rhineland - he wrote to the Crown Prince on 23 July 1923 : `` The most important objective of German politics is the liberation of German territory from foreign occupation .
However , he still favored an expansion of the social welfare program , and also supported allowing more ordinary Prussians to vote .
Stresemann conceived the idea that Germany would guarantee her western borders and pledged never to invade Belgium and France again , along with a guarantee from Britain that they would come to Germany 's aid if attacked by France .
Most of its support came from middle class and upper class Protestants .
He was close personal friends with many influential foreigners .
Germany 's eastern borders were guaranteed to Poland only by France , not by a general agreement .
Stresemann 's decision to end passive resistance was motivated by his view that making a good faith effort to fulfill the terms of Versailles was the only way to win relief from the treaty 's harsher provisions .
As Germany now had a veto on League resolutions , she could gain concessions from other countries on modifications on the Polish border or Anschluss with Austria , as other countries needed her vote .
However , he remained a monarchist at heart .
During his studies , Stresemann was exposed to the principal political arguments of his day , particularly the German debate about socialism .
The impression left on all was tremendous '' .
After this reconciliation with the Versailles powers , Stresemann moved to allay the growing suspicion of the Soviet Union .
In 1903 he married KÃ te Kleefeld -LRB- 1885-1970 -RRB- , daughter of a wealthy Jewish Berlin businessman .
Along with Matthias Erzberger and others , he was attacked as an ErfÃ 1\/4 llungspolitiker -LRB- `` fulfillment politician '' -RRB- .
At first , in the German Empire , Stresemann was on the left wing of the National Liberals .
The DVP platform promoted Christian family values , non-religious education , lower tariffs , opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsides and hostility to `` Marxism '' -LRB- that is , the Communists , and also the Social Democrats -RRB- .
With Bassermann kept away from the Reichstag by either illness or military service , Stresemann soon became the National Liberals ' de facto leader .
Although Stresemann did not propose the pact , Germany 's adherence convinced many people that Weimar Germany was a Germany that could be reasoned with .
In September 1926 , Germany was admitted to the League of Nations as permanent member of the Security Council .
This strategy worked remarkably well until it was derailed by the Great Depression after Stresemann 's death .
His father worked as a beer bottler and distributor , and also ran a small bar out of the family home , as well as renting rooms for extra money .
Gustav and KÃ the had two sons , Wolfgang and Joachim Stresemann .
In 1906 he was elected to the Dresden town council .
His first notable achievement was the Dawes Plan of 1924 , which reduced Germany 's overall reparations commitment and reorganized the Reichsbank .
Stresemann said that Germany alone should not make sacrifices for peace ; European countries should cede colonies to Germany ; the disarmament control commission should leave Germany ; the Anglo-French occupation of the Rhineland should be ended ; and Britain and France should disarm as Germany had done .
This new insight was instrumental in the Young Plan of February 1929 which led to more reductions in German reparations payment .
Germany could now act as `` the spokesman of the whole German cultural community '' and thereby provoke the German minorities in Czechoslovakia and Poland .
After Sir Austen Chamberlain became British Foreign Secretary , he wanted a British guarantee to France and Belgium as the Anglo-American guarantee had fallen due to the United States ' refusal to ratify the Treaty of Versailles .
German diplomacy faced a catastrophic situation '' .
Stresemann later wrote : `` Chamberlain had never been our friend .
His editorials for the paper were often political , and dismissed most political parties as wrong in one way or another .
By the mid-1920s , having contributed much to a -LRB- temporary -RRB- consolidation of the feeble democratic order , Stresemann was regarded as a Vernunftrepublikaner -LRB- republican by reason -RRB- - someone who accepted the Republic as the least of all evils , but was in their heart still loyal to the monarchy .
They left the coalition and caused its collapse on 23 November 1923 .
Stresemann was born on 10 May 1878 in the KÃ penicker StraÃ e area of southeast Berlin , the youngest of seven children .
During his period in the foreign ministry , Stresemann came more and more to accept the Republic , which he had at first rejected .
He , like virtually every German , felt Versailles was an onerous Diktat that sullied the nation 's honor .
According to Stresemann 's letter , there should be no settlement `` until -LRB- Poland 's -RRB- economic and financial distress has reached an extreme stage and reduced the entire Polish body politic to a state of powerlessness '' .
As Stresemann recorded , Briand `` almost fell off his sofa , when he heard my explanations '' .
In 1914 he returned to the Reichstag .
After Bassermann 's death in 1917 , Stresemann succeeded him as party leader .
Germany signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact in August 1928 .
In response to a British proposal , Stresemann wrote to the German ambassador in London : '' -LRB- A -RRB- final and lasting recapitalization of Poland must be delayed until the country is ripe for a settlement of the border according to our wishes and until our own position is sufficiently strong '' .
In 1902 he founded the Saxon Manufacturers ' Association .
As Chancellor , Stresemann went a long way towards resolving the crisis .
The family was lower middle class , but relatively well-off for the neighborhood , and had enough money to give Gustav with a high-quality education .
This was a sign that Germany was quickly becoming a `` normal '' state and assured the Soviet Union of Germany 's sincerity in the Treaty of Berlin .
First , we must remove the strangler from our throat '' .
In 1898 , Stresemann left the University of Berlin , and went to the University of Leipzig so that he could study for a doctorate .
During World War I , he gradually moved to the right . He supported the monarchy and Germany 's expansionist goals .
During his university years , Stresemann also became active in Burschenschaften movement of student fraternities , and in April 1898 became editor of the Allgemeine Deutsche UniversitÃ ts-Zeitung , a newspaper run by Konrad Kuster , a leader in the liberal part of the Burschenschaften .
He also spoke in support of unrestricted submarine warfare .
Germany officially recognized the post-World War I western border for the first time , and was guaranteed peace with France , and promised admission to the League of Nations and evacuation of the last Allied occupation troops from the Rhineland .
His main preoccupation was how to free Germany from the burden of reparations payments to Britain and France , imposed by the Treaty of Versailles .
In the same year , while Poland was in a state of political and economic crisis , Stresemann began a trade war against the country .
He shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926 .
Germany was in no position at the time to attack , as Stresemann wrote to the Crown Prince : `` The renunciation of a military conflict with France has only a theoretical significance , in so far as there is no possibility of a war with France '' .
Gustav Stresemann died of a stroke in October 1929 at the age of 51 .
On 13 August 1923 , in the midst of the Ruhr Crisis , he was appointed Chancellor and Foreign Minister of a grand coalition government .
The U.S. was Germany 's main source of food and raw materials , and one of Germany 's largest export markets for manufactured goods .

This allowed Sandra , Lil , and Darrah to make a plan to vote off Burton by having Sandra act like she was certainly the next one to go .
The next day , the two tribes merged -LRB- combined -RRB- into one tribe which the players named `` Balboa '' , a name given to a sea snake that Rupert had found and tried to nurse back to health but failed .

The tribes they were in for a short time upon their return were the same tribes they started in .
In the next challenge , the outcasts tribe won against Morgan and Drake ; both would have to vote off a player at separate tribal councils , while the outcasts tribe would vote in two players to return to the game in their place .
It was filmed in 2003 and started being shown on TV on September 18 , 2003 .

Burton and Lillian won reward .
Darrah was voted off , leaving Jon , Lil , and Sandra as the final three .

The two starting tribes were Drake -LRB- named for Sir Francis Drake -RRB- and Morgan -LRB- named for Henry Morgan -RRB- .
Though Rupert and others thought this was a bad idea , they did it anyway , purposely allowing Morgan to win .

Burton and Rupert won individual immunities , and , along with Lil 's anger , helped to voted out old Morgan members Andrew and Ryan O. Now there were more old Drake members than old Morgan members .
A twist for this season sent one player from the tribe winning reward to steal one item from the other tribe 's camp .
Jon and Burton planned to vote off the rest of the women players , voting off Tijuana and Christine .
Burton originally won immunity , but he lost it when Jeff Probst realized he 'd missed a misspelled word -LRB- `` liaison '' -RRB- .
While Burton made up with his old tribe , Lil 's return did n't make the other Morgan members too happy .
Drake , thanks to Sandra being able to speak Spanish and Rupert 's idea to steal the untouched shoes of Morgan and use them as exchanging goods , was able to get a lot of items , while Morgan did not plan as well .
With Drake looking like they were going to continue to win , Burton started a plan to purposely lose the fourth Immunity challenge to get rid of the tribe 's weaker players such as Trish and Christa .
This was not actually a reward challenge , but what the Outcasts won was a chance to get voted back into the game .
With five players left , Burton won a car reward and took Jon with him away from camp .
Both tribes lost a challenge to the Outcast Tribe made of the first 6 players voted off ; as a result , both tribes had to vote out a player .
Burton and Jon knew the woman were probably working against them , and to his surprise , Burton was voted off at the following tribal council , leaving Jon struggling to try to win back the womens ' trust .
Sandra was voted the Sole Survivor on a vote of 6-1 .
Though Sandra knew he was lying , Jon successfully convinced the other players , making them to give up the reward to Jon and then having to spend one night on Morgan 's old beach while Jon and his friend hung out alone , celebrating the lie 's success .
During this time , Osten , a member of Morgan , started to say that he wanted to quit the game .
The tribe moved to Drake 's beach .
Osten quit the game at Morgan 's tribal council .
Lillian Morris and Burton Roberts were brought back into the game on Day 20 , so they are both listed as having placed in two different points in the game .
The outcasts tribe chose Lil and Burton to return to the game , both , by chance , returning to their starting tribes but having immunity at the next tribal council .
During the last immunity challenge , Sandra fell out early , so Jon to try to convince Lil to take him to the final two .
Burton gave Jon his reward , while Lillian kept hers .
Jon and Burton planned to vote off the rest of the women players , voting off Tijuana and Christine . With five players left , Burton won a car reward and took Jon with him away from camp .
Host Jeff Probst was n't happy when Osten quit .
The players were split into the two tribes , Morgan and Drake , and given their running shoes , a small bag of money and a map to a close village where they would could use the money to get what they thought they needed for survival as well as a boat trip to their beach , and were told to swim the rest of the way .
As a result , Burton was voted out at Drake 's first tribal council .
Because of this , a runoff between those not already eliminated was conducted ; Darrah eventually won immunity .
When they arrived at their next challenge , the tribes found out that there was another twist , as the six players they had voted off before returned to the game as an `` outcast tribe '' .

Business magazine estimates that 15 million functionally illiterate adults had a job in the United States at the start of the 21st century .
That way , a person who is functionally illiterate may be able to write their name , but it is very difficult for them to write more than a few sentences .
Sociological research has demonstrated that countries with lower levels of functional illiteracy among their adult populations tend to be those with the highest levels of scientific literacy among the lower stratum of young people nearing the end of their formal academic studies .
There are four levels for each parameter : below basic , basic , intermediate , and proficient .
Every year 100,000 pupils leave school functionally illiterate in the UK .
The UK government 's Department for Education reported in 2006 that 47 percent of school children left school at age 16 without having achieved a basic level in functional maths , and 42 percent fail to achieve a basic level of functional English .
This report sees three parameters : prose , document , and quantitative literacy .
This correspondence suggests that a contributing factor to a society 's level of civic literacy is the capacity of schools to ensure students attain the functional literacy required to comprehend the basic texts and documents associated with competent citizenship .
The American Council of Life Insurers reported that 75 % of the Fortune 500 companies provide some level of training to help their workers overcome this situation .
A Literacy at Work study , published by the Northeast Institute in 2001 , found that business losses attributed to basic skill deficiencies run into billions of dollars a year due to low productivity , errors , and accidents attributed to functional illiteracy .
All over the U.S 30 million - 14 % of adults - are unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities .
For prose literacy , for example , a below basic level of literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information . Similarly , a person who is `` below basic '' in quantitative literacy might be able to add two numbers .

The speech famously begins with `` Four score and seven years ago '' , referring to the American Revolution in 1776 . Lincoln used the ceremony at Gettysburg to encourage the people to help America 's democracy , so that the `` government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish -LRB- be destroyed -RRB- from the earth '' .
So , some skeptics suggest that Lincoln did not say `` under God '' at Gettysburg .
When Lincoln found that his fourth written copy could not be used , he wrote a fifth copy .
Wills and the event committee then asked President Lincoln to join in the ceremony .
Wills was interested in how Lincoln used the ideas of birth , life , and death . Lincoln had described the nation as `` brought forth '' , `` conceived '' , and that shall not `` perish '' .
Republican newspaper printed the entire speech , calling it `` a perfect gem '' that was `` deep in feeling , compact -LRB- simple -RRB- in thought and expression , and tasteful and elegant in every word and comma '' .

In this 1830 speech , Webster had also described the Federal Government as `` made for the people , made by the people , and answerable to the people '' . This expression was very similar to Lincoln 's `` government of the people , by the people , for the people . ''
William R. Rathvon is the only known eyewitness of the Gettysburg Address to have left an audio recording of what he remembered .
Lincoln was officially asked to join only 17 days before the ceremony , while Everett had received his invitation 40 days earlier . `` Although there is some evidence Lincoln expected Wills 's letter , its late date makes the author -LRB- writer -RRB- appear days was extraordinarily -LRB- remarkably -RRB- short notice for presidential participation even by nineteenth-century standards '' .
It is now kept by the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in the Carl A. Kroch Library at Cornell University .
The only known and confirmed photograph of Lincoln at Gettysburg was taken by David Bachrach . It was identified in the Mathew Brady collection of photographic plates in 1952 .
Then , it was sold to different dealers and bought by Nicholas and Marguerite Lilly Notes . They donated it to Cornell in 1949 .
In this copy , like in the Nicolay Copy , the words `` under God '' are not there .
Yet at least three reporters telegraphed the words of the Gettysburg Address with the words `` under God '' included .
The Constitution of France spoke of France as a `` gouvernement du peuple , par le peuple et pour le peuple '' -LRB- `` government of the people , by the people , and for the people '' -RRB- . This was a direct translation of Lincoln 's words .
This version has been described as `` the most inexplicable '' of the drafts . It is sometimes referred to as the `` second draft '' .
Canadian politician William McDougall came as Lincoln 's guest .
The words `` under God '' , for example , are missing in this copy from the phrase `` that this nation -LRB- under God -RRB- shall have a new birth of freedom ... '' If the Nicolay draft was the copy Lincoln read from , either the modern transcriptions are not correct , or Lincoln spoke differently from his written text several times .
Today , this copy hangs in the Lincoln Room of the White House . It is a present from Oscar B. Cintas , who used to be a Cuban Ambassador to the United States .
Historian William E. Barton says :
In September 1863 , Pennsylvania 's Governor Curtin told Lincoln that people were turning against the war effort :
The Nicolay Copy appeared as a copy in an article written by Nicolay in 1894 . After that , it was thought to be among the papers passed to Hay by Nicolay 's daughter Helen when Nicolay died in 1901 .
It is the only version Lincoln put his signature on . It is also the last he is known to have written .
He had also served as Secretary of State , U.S. Senator , U.S. Representative , Governor of Massachusetts , president of Harvard University , and Vice Presidential candidate .
Matching folds can still be seen on the two pages , suggesting it could be the copy that eyewitnesses say Lincoln took from his coat pocket and read at the ceremony .
About 172,000 American soldiers fought in the Battle of Gettysburg from July 1 -- 3 , 1863 .
The Nicolay and Hay copies do not have the words `` under God '' , but they appear in the three later copies -LRB- Everett , Bancroft , and Bliss -RRB- .
came as a of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames '' .
It is the source of most modern copies of Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address .
There are many theories about where Lincoln 's expression of `` government of the people , by the people , for the people '' came from .
It was the common remark of everybody .
The speech is very important in the popular culture of the United States . However , people are not sure about the exact words of the speech .
The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address are different from one another in some details .
Lincoln 's son , Robert Todd Lincoln , made Nicolay and Hay the legal guardians of Lincoln 's papers in 1874 .
There is a story that Lincoln turned to his bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon and said that his speech `` wo n't scour -LRB- would n't be successful -RRB- '' .
The crowd was hushed into silence because the President stood before was so Impressive !
But the governor of Pennsylvania , Curtin , said , `` He pronounced -LRB- said -RRB- that speech in a voice that all the multitude -LRB- people -RRB- heard .
The Bancroft Copy of the Gettysburg Address was written by President Lincoln in February 1864 . The famous historian George Bancroft , the `` father of American History '' , who wrote History of the United States , had asked him to write it for him .

The battlefield had more than 7,500 bodies of dead soldiers and 5,000 horses .
Charles Hale `` had notebook and pencil in hand , -LRB- and -RRB- took down the slow-spoken words of the President '' .
It was delivered on the afternoon of Thursday , November 19 , 1863 . This speech was made during the American Civil War , at the dedication of the Soldiers ' National Cemetery in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania .
Cintas liked to collect art and manuscripts . He had bought the Bliss Copy for $ 54,000 at a public auction in 1949 .
In an 1894 article , Nicolay wrote that Lincoln had brought to Gettysburg the first part of the speech written in ink . Nicolay also said that Lincoln had written the second page in pencil on lined paper before November 19 .
Another source of the Gettysburg Address is the copy from the Associated Press . It was copied from the notes taken by reporter Joseph L. Gilbert .
If the election were to occur now , the result would be extremely doubtful -LRB- not sure -RRB- , and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result , my impression is , the chances would be against us .
The National Public Radio -LRB- NPR -RRB- discovered a copy during a `` Quest for Sound '' project in 1999 .
Webster also said , `` This the independent offspring of the popular will .
It is not the creature of State the whole truth must be told , the people brought it into existence , established it , and have hitherto -LRB- until now -RRB- supported it , for the very purpose , amongst others , of imposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties '' .
The Democratic Chicago Times said , `` The cheek of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly , flat and dishwatery utterances -LRB- remarks -RRB- of the man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the President of the United States '' .
In The American Monthly Review of Reviews , it is suggested that the writings of William Herndon , Lincoln 's law partner , much influenced Lincoln . William Herndon wrote in Abraham Lincoln : The True Story of A Great Life that he had brought some of the sermons of abolitionist minister Theodore Parker to Lincoln , who had been moved by them .
Gopnik felt that `` Lincoln had mastered the sound of the King James Bible so completely that he could recast -LRB- make again -RRB- abstract issues of constitutional law in Biblical terms -LRB- words from the Bible -RRB- , making the proposition -LRB- suggestion -RRB- that Texas and New Hampshire should be forever bound by a single post office sound like something right out of Genesis '' .
There was no applause when he stopped speaking '' .
The draft is very odious in the State ... the Democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion , and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent , and the changes are against us .
Also , Wills 's letter `` made it equally clear to the president that he would have only a small part in the ceremonies '' .
Lincoln 's 1863 drafts were not popular , and people became angriest with them around the time of the New York Draft Riots . This was just ten days after the Battle of Gettysburg .
The reporters who were there at that time included Joseph Gilbert , Charles Hale , John R. Young . There were also reporters from the Cincinnati Commercial , New York Tribune , and New York Times .
Lincoln 's `` few appropriate remarks '' summarized the war in ten sentences .
The Battle of Gettysburg was an important influence on the American Civil War and on the town of Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , where only 2,400 people lived .
`` Every stenographic report , good , bad and indifferent -LRB- poor -RRB- , says ` that the nation shall , under God , have a new birth of freedom . '
There are several early copies on Executive Mansion paper , and reports of Lincoln finishing his speech while he was a guest of David Wills at Gettysburg .
Wills was allowed to buy 17 acres -LRB- 69,000 mÂ -RRB- for a cemetery to honor the people who died in the battle . He paid $ 2,475.87 for the land .
The Everett Copy is also known as the `` Everett-Keyes Copy '' . It was sent by President Lincoln to Edward Everett in early 1864 .
Lincoln 's short speech became known in history as one of the best examples of English public speeches . Everett 's two-hour oration was called the `` Gettysburg address '' that day , but his oration is not well-known today .
The Republican said that Lincoln 's short remarks would `` repay further study as the model speech '' .
One year before he died in 1939 , Rathvon 's remarks were recorded on February 12 , 1938 . It included his reading the address itself .
Both the Hay and Nicolay copies of the Address are inside the Library of Congress . They are inside specially designed , temperature-controlled , sealed containers with argon gas .
The organizing committee agreed , and the dedication was moved to Thursday , November 19 .
But Lincoln wrote on both sides of the paper , so he could not use it for this purpose . Therefore , Bancroft was allowed to keep it .
Lincoln 's speech was short , but he and others sat for hours during the rest of the program .
But some of the words and expressions in the Nicolay Copy do not match modern transcriptions of Lincoln 's speech . Because of this , some people believe that the text used at Gettysburg has been lost .
The `` Hay Copy '' was probably made on the morning of the delivery of the Address . It could also have been made shortly after Lincoln came back to Washington .
Moving all the bodies to the graves in the cemetery was less than half complete on the day of the ceremony .
There was no common source from which all the reporters could have obtained those words but from Lincoln 's own lips at the time of delivery .
John Nicolay kept this copy of the Gettysburg Address until he died in 1901 . When he died , it was passed on to his friend John Hay .
Among the five copies , it is the only one to be privately owned .
Wills ' letter said , `` It is the desire , as Chief Executive of the nation , formally -LRB- officially -RRB- set apart these a few appropriate -LRB- proper -RRB- remarks '' .
`` Standing beneath this serene sky , overlooking these broad fields now reposing from the labors of the waning year , the mighty Alleghenies dimly towering before us , the graves of our brethren beneath our feet , it is with hesitation that I raise my poor voice to break of God and Nature .
Then there was an impressive silence like our Menallen Friends Meeting .
The other three copies of the address -LRB- the Everett , Bancroft , and Bliss copies -RRB- were written a long time after November 19 . They were written by Lincoln for charitable purposes .
Its text is different , however , from the written versions prepared by Lincoln before and after his speech .
The Illinois State Historical Library in Springfield , Illinois has it on display . It is in the Treasures Gallery of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum .
The Bliss copy has become the most widely accepted text of Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address . This is partly because Lincoln gave it a title and signed and dated it .
Bancroft wanted to put this copy in Autograph Leaves of Our Country 's Authors and sell it at a Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Sanitary Fair in Baltimore .
In Lincoln at Gettysburg , Garry Wills notes the similarity between Lincoln 's speech and Pericles 's Funeral Oration during the Peloponnesian War -LRB- James McPherson and Gore Vidal also note this -RRB- .
In 1931 , 87-year-old Mrs. Sarah A. Cooke Myers suggested that there was a dignified silence after Lincoln finished his speech . She had been there when she was 19 years old .
It will not do to say that -LRB- Secretary of War -RRB- Stanton suggested those words after Lincoln 's return to Washington , for the words were telegraphed by at least three reporters on the afternoon of the delivery '' .
The people who believe it was completed on the morning of his address note that it has some expressions that are not in the first draft but are in the reports of the address and in later copies by Lincoln . It is likely , they say , that Lincoln used this copy when he delivered the address .
In the fall of 1863 , he grew very concerned about keeping up the Union 's spirits toward the war effort .
Other public reaction to the speech was different according to each party .
The Nicolay Copy is often called the `` first draft '' . This is because it is thought to be the earliest copy that exists .
The title of the record was `` I Heard Lincoln That Day - William R. Rathvon , TR Productions '' .
Lincoln replied that he was glad the speech was not a `` total -LRB- complete -RRB- failure '' .
Lincoln gave a copy to each of his private secretaries , John Nicolay and John Hay .
Each of the five manuscript copies of the Gettysburg Address are named for the person who received it from Lincoln .
After Everett finished his speech , Lincoln spoke for two or three minutes .
Among these , the Bliss version , written some time after the speech for a friend , is seen by lots of people as the most reliable text .
Because Everett 's speech was very long , and because it took a long time for 19th century photographers to prepare for taking a picture , it is likely that photographers were not prepared for how short Lincoln 's speech was .
He added that it is hard to find any obviously classical references in all of his speeches .
However , David Willis , a rich 32-year-old lawyer , did not like this idea . He wrote to the Governor of Pennsylvania , Andrew Gregg Curtin , asking that a National Cemetery be supported by the states .
For example , Everett spoke directly about Marathon and Pericles . But he said that `` Lincolnâ s rhetoric is , instead , deliberately Biblical '' .
Lincoln later gave this copy to his other secretary , John Hay . Hay 's descendants gave it and the Nicolay Copy to the Library of Congress in 1916 .
He honors the dead 's sacrifice : `` Thus choosing to die resisting , rather than to live submitting , they fled only from dishonor , but met danger face to face '' . He also warmly encourages the living to continue to fight for true democracy : `` You , their survivors , must determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field , though you may pray that it may have a happier issue '' .
But the ; -- grant me , I pray sympathy '' .
Such a speech , as they said it was ! ''
Historian Shelby Foote said that the applause , which came after a long time , was `` barely polite '' .
It is on permanent display as part of the American Treasures exhibition of the Library of Congress in Washington , D.C.
This included the governors of six of the 24 Union states . They were Andrew Gregg Curtin of Pennsylvania , Augustus Bradford of Maryland , Oliver P. Morton of Indiana , Horatio Seymour of New York , Joel Parker of New Jersey , and David Tod of Ohio .

Garry Wills felt that '' -LRB- Lincoln -RRB- had done what he wanted to do -LRB- at Gettysburg -RRB- '' .
Martin Luther King , Jr. 's famous speech of `` I Have a Dream '' spoke of the Gettysburg Address .
Craig R. Smith , In `` Criticism of Political Rhetoric and Disciplinary Integrity '' , suggested that the Gettysburg Address was influenced by the speech of Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster . In his `` Second Reply to Hayne '' , Webster had famously cried out , `` Liberty and Union , now and forever , one and inseparable '' !
The Gettysburg Address is a speech by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln .
There has been some controversy about the two earliest drafts of the Address .
Everett , who was collecting the speeches at the Gettysburg dedication into one book to sell for hurt soldiers at New York 's Sanitary Commission Fair , had asked for it .
Everett was a very famous orator at that time .
The Hay Draft was different from the Gettysburg Address printed by Nicolay in 1894 in many important ways . For example , it was written on a different kind of paper , had a different number of words on every line , had a different number of lines , and had corrections in Lincoln 's handwriting .
At first , they planned to buy land for a cemetery and ask the families of the dead to pay for the burial .
Others , such as Allen C. Guelzo , suggested that Lincoln 's expression `` four score and seven '' was about the King James Version of the Bible 's . There , man 's life is described as `` threescore years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years '' .
Many years have passed after the Address was delivered , but it is still one of the most famous speeches in American history .
NPR allows people to hear the record around Lincoln 's birthday .
That was the greatest purpose of Lincoln 's Address at Gettysburg .
In 1906 , it was first announced that the Hay Copy had been discovered . It had been found among the papers of John Hay when people were searching for the `` original manuscript '' of the Address .
The Castro government claimed Cintas ' properties after it became powerful in 1959 . But Cintas , who died in 1957 , had willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people , if it would be kept at the White House .
In August 1963 , King spoke of President Lincoln and his well-known words : `` Five score years ago , a great American , in whose symbolic shadow we stand today , signed the Emancipation Proclamation .
`` But they , I am sure , will join us in saying , as we bid farewell to the dust of these martyr-heroes , the glorious annals of our common country , there will be no brighter page than that which relates the Battles of Gettysburg '' .
The following day , Everett wrote a letter to Lincoln . In the letter , he praised the President for his speech , saying , `` I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central -LRB- main -RRB- idea of the occasion , in two hours , as you did in two minutes '' .
Scholars are not sure if the Nicolay Copy was actually the copy Lincoln read from at Gettysburg on November 19 .
`` He took down what he declared was the exact language of Lincoln 's associates confirmed his testimony , which was received , as it deserved to be at its face value '' .
The characteristics of this secret or key are determined by the system which uses it ; some system require that such keys be in a specific format .
In cryptography , a pre-shared key or PSK is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it is used .
The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems .
It can be a password like ` bret13i ' , a passphrase like ` Idaho hung gear id gene ' , or a hexadecimal string like ' 65E4 E556 8622 EEE1 ' .
Such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms .

The particle in a 1-dimensional well is the most simple example showing that the energy of a particle can only have specific values .
Quantum mechanics is important to physics and chemistry .
For the 1-dimensional case in the direction , the time-independent SchrÃ dinger equation can be written as :
It turned out that quantum mechanics was right , and that what Einstein had used as a reason to reject quantum mechanics actually happened .
The well has zero potential energy inside a range and has infinite potential energy everywhere outside that range .
In the early days of quantum mechanics , Albert Einstein suggested that if it were right then quantum mechanics would mean that there would be `` spooky action at a distance . '' It turned out that quantum mechanics was right , and that what Einstein had used as a reason to reject quantum mechanics actually happened .
This led to a theory about subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves called wave-particle duality . This is where particles and waves were neither one nor the other , but had certain properties of both .

Special arteries connect between arterioles and venules and are important in bypassing the flow of blood through the capillaries . True capillaries come from mainly from metarterioles and provide movement between cells and the circulation .
Capillaries are small , and smaller than any other blood vessels .
They are about 5-10 Î 1\/4 ms big , which connect arterioles and venules , and enable the moving of water , oxygen , carbon dioxide , and many other nutrient and waste chemical between blood and surrounding tissues .
After oxygen has been moved to the tissue , capillaries join and widen to become small veins and then widen more to become veins , which return blood to the heart .
The width of 8 Î 1\/4 m forces the red blood cells to partly fold into bullet-like shapes in order to bypass them in single file .
The `` capillary bed '' is the network of capillaries supplying an organ .
The more metabolically active the cells , the more capillaries it will require to supply nutrients and carry away waste products .
Precapillary muscles are rings of smooth muscles at the start of true capillaries that handle blood flow into true capillaries and control blood flow through a body part or area .
Blood moves from the heart to arteries , which branch and narrow into smaller arteries , and then branch more into capillaries .

Some stem groupstem metatherians persisted well into the Neogene period before becoming extinct .
Metatherians first appeared in the Cretaceous period .
Both are conventionally united as infraclasses within the subclass Theria , which contains all living mammals except monotremes .
During development , metatherians produce a yolk sac placenta and give birth to ` larval-like ' offspring .
The earliest known representative , Sinodelphys , is from the Lower Cretaceous of China .
First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880 , it is nearly synonymous with the earlier taxon Marsupialia , but it also contains the nearest fossil relatives of marsupial mammals .
Crown group marsupials , the one branch of Metatheria that survives today , diversified close to the time of extinction at the end of the Cretaceous .
These offspring have underdeveloped rear limbs , and after birth they migrate to the marsupium where they attach to a nipple .
The Greek words meta - and theria roughly means the `` other beasts '' , in contrast with Eutheria -LRB- `` true beasts '' -RRB- .
The closest relatives of the metatheres are the Eutheria -LRB- also erected by Huxley in 1880 -RRB- .

Playback experiments show that C. leucoviridis is able to attract males of many cicada species , even though cicada mating signals are species-specific .
Female signals are based on that received from the male , each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species .
Female fireflies of the genus Photuris emit the same light signals that females of other genera use as a mating signal .
The Australian katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis can attract male cicadas by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas .
Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics , and are subsequently captured and eaten .

The essence of the Socratic method is to convince the interlocutor that whereas he thought he knew something , in fact he does not '' .
It is the central technique of the Socratic method .
Socrates , unlike the Sophists , did believe that knowledge was possible , but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of one 's ignorance .
Guthrie writes , '' -LRB- Socrates -RRB- was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything , and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance , while they were not .
The exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate , in particular concerning whether it is a positive method , leading to knowledge , or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge .
The Latin form elenchus -LRB- plural elenchi -RRB- is used in English as the technical philosophical term .
According to W.K.C. Guthrie , the Socratic method was intended to demonstrate one 's ignorance .
In Plato 's early dialogues , the elenchus is the technique Socrates uses to investigate ethical concepts , such as justice or virtue .
The Socratic Method -LRB- or Method of Elenchus or Socratic Debate -RRB- , is named after the Greek philosopher Socrates .
According to one scholar , it has the following steps :

This is due to the use of different criteria for each approach .
For small bodies which are not internally differentiated , the surface and internal compositions are presumably similar , while large bodies such as 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta are known to have internal structure .
They are , with their largest exemplars :
This is presumably because these bodies are much smaller than those detected in the Main Belt , and as such may have younger less-altered surfaces or be composed of a less varied mix of minerals .
The present-day classification was initiated by Clark R. Chapman , David Morrison , and Ben Zellner in 1975 -LRB- 1 -RRB- with three categories : C for dark carbonaceous objects , S for stony -LRB- silicaceous -RRB- objects , and U for those which did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded and clarified .
In this Bus and Binzel SMASS scheme only a single type was assigned to any particular asteroid .
A significant number of small asteroids were found to fall in the Q , R , and V types , which were represented by only a single body in the Tholen scheme .
This scheme includes 14 types with the majority of asteroids falling into one of three broad categories , and several smaller types .
Scientists have been unable to agree on a better taxonomic system , largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids -LRB- e.g. finer resolution spectra , or non-spectral data such as densities would be very useful -RRB- .
A list of types can be found at asteroid spectral classes .
Objects were sometimes assigned a combined type such as e.g. CG when their properties were a combination of those typical for several types .
This survey produced spectra of a far higher resolution than ECAS , and was able to resolve a variety of narrow spectral features .
Also , albedos were not considered .
The two most widely used classifications are described below :
This classification was developed from broad band spectra -LRB- between 0.31 Î 1\/4 m and 1.06 Î 1\/4 m -RRB- obtained during the Eight-Color Asteroid Survey -LRB- ECAS -RRB- in the 1980s , in combination with albedo measurements -LRB- 4 -RRB- .
A number of classification schemes are currently in existence -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- , and while they strive to retain some mutual consistency , quite a few asteroids are sorted into different classes depending on the particular scheme .
However , a somewhat smaller range of wavelengths -LRB- 0.44 Î 1\/4 m to 0.92 Î 1\/4 m -RRB- was observed .
This is a more recent taxonomy introduced by Schelte J. Bus and Richard P. Binzel in 2002 , based on the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey -LRB- SMASS -RRB- of 1447 asteroids -LRB- 5 -RRB- .
However , for now , the spectral classification based on the two above coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys from the 1990s is still the standard .
Asteroids are assigned a type based on spectral shape , color , and sometimes albedo .
These types are thought to correspond to an asteroid 's surface composition .
These classification schemes are expected to be refined and\/or replaced as further research progresses .
The majority of bodies fall again into the three broad C , S , and X categories , with a few unusual bodies categorized into several smaller types :
A few Near-Earth objects have spectra which differ strongly from any of the SMASS classes .
The original formulation was based on 978 asteroids .
The most widely used taxonomy for over a decade has been that of David J. Tholen , first proposed in 1984 .
While attempting to keep to the Tholen taxonomy as much as possible given the differing data , asteroids were sorted into the 24 types given below .

She copied the work into a hardcover book with a frontispiece picture of Mrs. Rabbit giving Peter camomile tea at the end of the book .
Linda Lear noted that Potter began a new kind of animal fable in The Tale of Peter Rabbit . She had made one in which anthropomorphic animals look and act like real animals , with pictures that were drawn by a scientifically minded artist .
When Peter loses his jacket and his shoes , Mr. McGregor uses them to dress a scarecrow .
However , while Mrs. Rabbit is shopping and the girls are picking blackberries , Peter enters the garden .
Potter 's manuscript book had the title of The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor 's Garden . The manuscript was refused by six publishers .
In a 1904 sequel , The Tale of Benjamin Bunny , Peter goes back to McGregor 's garden to find his lost clothes .
She sent Warne some new color illustrations with a copy of her privately printed edition . Warne then gave these two the famous picture book artist , L. Leslie Brooke , to see what he thought about the pictures .
When Warne asked why there were n't any colors in the illustrations , though , Potter replied that rabbit-brown and green colors were not interesting .
Some publishers wanted a shorter story . Others wanted a longer one .
It has been translated into 36 languages . It sold 45 million copies , and became one of the most popular books of all time .
The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a children 's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter . It is about the adventures of disobedient , playful young Peter Rabbit as he is chased around the garden of Mr. McGregor .
The story was written for five-year-old Noel Moore . He was the son of Annie Moore , who had been Potter 's governess in 1893 .
Peter Rabbit , his sisters Flopsy , Mopsy , and Cottontail , and his mother are anthropomorphic rabbits . They dress in human clothing and usually walk standing up .
Potter and Warne agreed to publish cheap 5,000 copies .
A movie by Golden Films , The New Adventures of Peter Rabbit , gave Peter longer teeth and a fourth sister named Hopsy .
In 1916 , Louise A. Field became rich by writing books such as Peter Rabbit Goes to School or Peter Rabbit and His Ma .
Warne wanted color illustrations in The Tale of Peter Rabbit , which he called the ` bunny book ' . He also suggested that they only use 32 illustrations instead of the first 42 illustrations .
The company refused Rawnsley 's version , but they wanted to see Potter 's complete manuscript . They hoped that The Tale of Peter Rabbit would be as successful as Helen Bannerman 's greatly popular Little Black Sambo and other children 's books that were being sold at that time .
Peter Rabbit came out as a character in a 1971 ballet film , and the tale has been used for a television series .
Soon the first private printing of 250 copies was sold out , and another 200 had to be prepared .
It was corrected and privately printed by Potter in 1901 after several publishers refused to print the book . It was printed by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1902 .
In 1901 , a friend of Potter 's family , Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley , changed Potter 's story into a poem and tried giving his version , together with her illustrations and some of her corrected writing , to Frederick Warne & Co. .
Mother Rabbit told her children not to go into the garden of Mr. McGregor . This is because their father was made into a pie there .
At last , she decided to publish the book herself . On 16 December 1901 , the first 250 copies of her privately printed The Tale of Peter Rabbit were given out to her family and friends .
There , he eats so many vegetables he becomes sick . After that , Mr. McGregor tries to catch Peter .
She said that the tale was a `` perfect marriage of word and image '' and `` a triumph of fantasy and fact '' .
Peter is almost caught by Mr. McGregor many times . When he finally escapes from Mr. McGregor , Peter goes back home to his mother .
At that time , the traditional literary hero was usually a brave , clever , young white male . Yet Peter Rabbit , the hero of The Tale of Peter Rabbit , was a disobedient little rabbit .
By the middle of 1903 there was a fifth printing , and in the same month , there was a sixth printing . A year after the first commercial publication there were 56,470 copies printed .
She puts him to bed and makes him drink camomile tea because he is tired and sick . However , his sisters -LRB- who have been good little rabbits -RRB- enjoy bread and milk and blackberries for dinner .
After it was printed , much merchandise for both children and adults with Peter Rabbit was produced . Toys , dishes , food , clothing , videos and other products showed pictures of Peter Rabbit .
Potter had owned a pet rabbit called Peter Piper .
She took her letters -LRB- which had been carefully saved by the Moore children -RRB- and chose a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five-year-old Noel about a rabbit named Peter .
In the 1890s , Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of Annie Moore , who had used to be her governess . In 1900 , Moore , who realized how popular Potter 's stories could become , suggested they be made into books .
By the end of the year there were 28,000 copies in print .
She began to fully realize the need to license her books properly when , after she had successfully published The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin , her father found a toy squirrel called Nutkin at the Burlington Arcade in Christmas 1903 .
Potter was one of the first to begin such merchandise when she made a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 . After that , a Peter Rabbit board game was produced .
Even before it was published in early October 1902 , the first 8,000 copies were sold .
Warne 's New York office did not register the copyright for The Tale of Peter Rabbit in the United States . Because of this , unlicensed copies of the book began to appear in the spring of 1903 .
Another video about the story showed Peter as a Christian preacher singing songs about God and Jesus with children and vegetables .
She noted in one copy that her pet rabbit Peter had died on 26 January 1901 .
The next year , an official contract was signed in June 1902 .
In mid-December 1935 , he began to record for Columbia Records on the organ of All-Hallows-by-the-Tower , Barking , London .
Recordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD .
Between 1934 and 1935 , he had a trial recording for HMV on the organ of the old Queen 's Hall in London .
Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas , lions , dolphins , dwarf mongooses , domestic goats , and domestic dogs .
In fact , relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams .
Up until recently , the literature dealing with reconciliation in non-primates have consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data .
Conflict resolution has also been studied in non-humans , like dogs , cats , monkeys , snakes , elephants , and primates -LRB- see Frans de Waal , 2000 -RRB- .
Stress responses , like an increased heart rate , usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals .
Conflict resolution is a set of ideas and ways to reduce sources of conflict . The term `` conflict resolution '' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term `` dispute resolution '' .
Different types of primates , as well as many other species who are living in groups , show different types of conciliatory behavior .
In many non-Western cultural contexts , such as Afghanistan , Vietnam , and China , it is also important to find `` win-win '' solutions ; however , getting there can be very different .
Conflict resolution is a set of ideas and ways to reduce sources of conflict .
Additional graduate programs are offered at Georgetown University , Eastern Mennonite University and Trinity College Dublin .
Aggression is more common among animal relatives and within a group , than between groups .
In these contexts , direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude , making the conflict worse and delaying resolution .
In many schools in the UK , conflict resolution has now become an integral part of the SEAL -LRB- Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning -RRB- program , chiming , as it does , with the SEAL principles of developing social skills and an understanding of ones own feelings .
Universities worldwide offer programs of study pertaining to conflict research , analysis , and practice .
In addition to research in primates , biologists are beginning to explore reconciliation in other animals .
Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different , and there is much occasion for misunderstanding .
Furthermore , this expansion of the field has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as in businesses , court systems , government agencies nonprofit organizations , government agencies and educational institutions serving throughout the world .
The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as arbitrators , mediators , facilitators , and ombudsmen or conflict specialists to resolve conflicts .
Instead of creating a distance between the individuals , however , the primates were more intimate in the period after the aggressive incident .
Conflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to cultural background .
Many students completing a doctoral program enter the field as researchers , theorists , analysts , policy makers and professors in higher education .
In Western cultural contexts , such as Canada and the United States , successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants , problem solving , and drafting agreements that meet their underlying needs .
In these situations , conflict resolvers often talk about finding the win-win solution , or mutually satisfying scenario , for everyone involved -LRB- see Fisher and Ury -LRB- 1981 -RRB- , Getting to Yes -RRB- .
These intimacies consisted of grooming and various forms of body contact .
Processes of conflict resolution generally include negotiation , mediation , and diplomacy .
George Mason Universityâ s Institute of Conflict Analysis and Resolution offers undergraduate , certificate and masters programs in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and a Ph. D. program in The Philosophy in Conflict and Conflict Resolution .
The processes of arbitration , litigation , and formal complaint processes such as ombudsman processes , are usually described with the term dispute resolution , although some refer to them as `` conflict resolution '' .
The Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations -LRB- ILR -RRB- houses the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution , which offers undergraduate , graduate , and professional training on conflict resolution .
Furthermore , the Pax Ludens Foundation based in the Netherlands is an organization that puts together conflict resolution simulations set in an International Relations scenario to help students learn about the intricacies of where conflict emerges in the world of international politics .
Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival , hence has a strong evolutionary value .
The term `` conflict resolution '' is sometimes used interchangeably with the term `` dispute resolution '' .
Rather , it can make sense to involve religious , tribal or community leaders , communicate difficult truths indirectly through a third party , and make suggestions through stories -LRB- see David Augsberger -LRB- 1992 -RRB- , Conflict Mediation Across Cultures -RRB- .
Conflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice , both in the U.S. and around the world .
Also , many of the major international NGOs have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution .
These findings contradicted previous existing theories about the general function of aggression , i.e. creating space between individuals -LRB- first proposed by Konrad Lorenz -RRB- , which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups .
Although peaceful , post-conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s , it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in feral sheep .
Conflict resolution is a growing area of interest in UK pedagogy , with teachers and students both encouraged to learn about mechanisms that lead to aggressive action , and those that lead to peaceful resolution .

For that work , they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969 , sharing it with Alfred Hershey .
Trained as a physicist , he got his Ph. D. in 1930 . he traveled through England , Denmark , and Switzerland .
This research , known as the Luria-Delbr Ã 1\/4 ck experiment , was also significant for its use of mathematics to make quantitative predictions for the results to be expected from alternative models .
In 1947 , DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck returned to Caltech as a professor of biology where he remained until 1977 .
He met Wolfgang Pauli and Niels Bohr , who got him interested in biology .
In 1937 , he moved to the United States to pursue his interests in biology , taking up research in the Biology Division at Caltech on genetics of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster .
Max Ludwig Henning DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck -LRB- September 4 , 1906 -- March 9 , 1981 -RRB- was a German-American biophysicist and Nobel laureate .
While at Caltech DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck became acquainted with bacteria and their viruses -LRB- bacteriophage or ` phage ' -RRB- .
DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck 's big idea was to explore genetics by means of the bacteriophage viruses which infect bacteria . This was important in the early development of molecular biology .
DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck was one of the most influential people in the movement of physical scientists into biology during the 20th century .

It was announced by Ubisoft on November 20 , 2007 .
The multiplayer in Tom Clancyâ s Rainbow Six : Vegas 2 has been expanded to include more than 10 new close-quarters maps , two new adversarial modes , a newer and different rewards system , and according to Ubisoft , improved online matchmaking .
Michael Walters Michael Walterâ s three year tour in 40 Commando Royal Marines included the military evacuation of British nationals from the Democratic Republic of Congo and active operations in West Belfast .
Knight If co-op mode is enabled , Knight accompanies Bishop on missions , whose appearance also varies depending on how the player desires him\/her to look .
For two years , Park served as part of the 15th Security Battalionâ s signals unit .
Gabriel Nowak The game 's main antagonist , a traitorous former Rainbow operative revealed as a mole in Rainbow Six : Vegas .
After three years with the 5th SFB , Park volunteered for the 707th Special Mission Battalion , South Koreaâ s elite counter-terrorist and quick-reaction unit .
He is later seen after Bishop 's showdown with Nowak at the end of the game .
Logan Keller The main protagonist in Rainbow Six : Vegas , Keller is seen in the opening level of the game .
Keller demonstrates a formidable sense of close-quarters combat -LRB- CQB -RRB- , with realistic analyses of certain hostage situations and how to eliminate the opposition in an effective and concise manner .
When Parkâ s two year term with the 707th concluded , he was immediately invited to join Rainbow .
Playing as Knight also allows the player to unlock co-op achievements .
Jung Park A character of South Korean nationality , Jung Parkâ s natural proficiency for computers drove him to serve his mandatory term in the ROK Army immediately after graduation .
The game was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on March 18 , 2008 in North America and March 20 2008 in Europe , except in Germany , where the game was delayed .
During his time as a Black Dragon , Park earned top marksmanship decorations in every long-range category , as well as SCUBA and parachute qualifications .
It is a first person shooter video game and the sequel to Tom Clancy 's Rainbow Six : Vegas .
Parkâ s high scores on electronics screening made him eligible for entry into the 1st Anti-Guerrilla Group .
Nowak betrays more Rainbow operatives in Vegas 2 , mainly by posing falsely as an NSA agent , helping Bishop along the way for some of the campaign while actually putting Bishop in a state of danger , in order to kill him\/her , which fails .
During a joint training mission with SAS and 1st SFOD-D , Park caught Ding Chavezâ s eye for his mix of electronics and combat expertise .
Bishop Bishop is the main protagonist that the player controls and guides throughout the events of Rainbow Six : Vegas 2 .
Logan is seen quoting Bishop 's teachings at the last level , implying his respect towards Bishop .
He\/she is a high-ranking veteran of the Rainbow organization , and is an instructor at the organization 's training academy when the game first begins .
His\/her appearance and gender vary , depending on the intended look by the player .
In 2004 , Park received a transfer to the ROK Armyâ s 5th Special Forces Brigade -LRB- Airborne -RRB- .
The experience point -LRB- XP -RRB- system is different than the old Vegas , for every kill achieved the player gains XP .
Bishop eventually kills him in a final showdown at a villa in Costa Rica .
Rainbow Six Vegas 2 -LRB- RSV2 -RRB- is the ninth installment in the Rainbow Six series -LRB- including add-ons -RRB- .
Bishop is referred five years after the first mission in the French Alps , Bishop returns from retirement as the team leader of Park and Walters .
Though cunning and ambitious , Nowak 's gung-ho recklessness earns him the disrespect of fellow teammates , ultimately leading to Bishop passing him up for promotion in favor of Logan , which therefore leads to Nowak betraying the Rainbow organization with the assistance of big-time terrorist ringleaders .
His\/her role , however , is limited as merely a co-op player , and unlike some games , such as Gears of War and Halo 3 , Knight is not critical to the single player campaign 's story , as elaborated on the Eurogamer review .
Either way , Bishop is still called `` sir '' in the game .

Australopithecus is sometimes referred to as the `` gracile -LRB- slender -RRB- australopithecines '' , while Paranthropus are also called the `` robust australopithecines '' .
A likely ancestor of the Australopithecines is the genus Ardipithecus genus , which lived in East Africa .
They are classified within the Hominina subtribe of the Hominini tribe .
The term Australopithecine refers to any species in the related genera Australopithecus or Paranthropus .
They appeared in the Pliocene .
An alternative possibility is that Homo derived directly from Ardipithecus , with an as yet undiscovered link connecting Ardipithecus and Homo habilis existing in parallel to the Australopithecines in the period 4 to 2.5 million years ago .
The genus Homo -LRB- humans -RRB- , appears about 2.4 million years ago with Homo habilis . They may be descended from australopithecine ancestors , more precisely from Kenyanthropus platyops branching off Australopithecus some 3.5 million years ago .
When used alone , the term refers to both genera together .

He identified that chromatin was correlated to threadlike structures in the cell nucleus -- the chromosomes -LRB- meaning colored body -RRB- .
Two decades would pass before the significance of Flemming 's work was truly realized with the rediscovery of Mendel 's rules .
His discovery of mitosis and chromosomes is considered one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of all times , and one of the 10 most important discoveries in cell biology .
Edouard Van Beneden -LRB- 1846 â `` 1910 -RRB- had also observed them , independently .
On the basis of his discoveries , Flemming surmised for the first time that all cell nuclei came from another predecessor nucleus -LRB- he coined the phrase omnis nucleus e nucleo , after Virchow 's omnis cellula e cellula -RRB- .
Making use of dyes he was able to find a structure which he named chromatin .
However , he did not see the splitting into identical halves , the daughter chromatids .
Flemming investigated the process of cell division and the distribution of chromosomes to the daughter nuclei , a process he called mitosis from the Greek word for thread .
Walther Flemming -LRB- 21 April 1843 â `` 4 August 1905 -RRB- was a German biologist and a founder of cytogenetics .
He studied mitosis , both in life and in stained preparations , using as the source of biological material the fins and gills of salamanders .
These results were published first in 1878 and in 1882 in the seminal book Zellsubstanz , Kern und Zelltheilung -LRB- 1882 ; Cell substance , nucleus and cell division -RRB- .
Flemming was unaware of Gregor Mendel 's -LRB- 1822 â `` 1884 -RRB- work on heredity , so he did not make the connection between his observations and genetic inheritance .

The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family , which consists of Homer , Marge , Bart , Lisa , and Maggie .
The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield , and lampoons American culture , society and television , and many aspects of the human condition .
It is the longest-running prime time animated series and longest-running sitcom in the United States .
However , Gunsmokes episode count of 635 episodes far surpasses The Simpsons , which would not reach that mark until its approximate 29th season , under normal programming schedules .
The year 2007 marked the twentieth anniversary of The Simpsons franchise .
The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company .
The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks .
Since its debut on December 17 , 1989 the show has broadcast 441 episodes and the twentieth season began airing on September 28 , 2008 .
Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family , substituting Bart for his own name .
With its twentieth season -LRB- 2008 â `` 2009 -RRB- currently airing , the series is equal with Gunsmoke as the longest-running American primetime , scripted television series .

The resulting V8 JavaScript engine was designed for speed and introduces new features with that in mind such as hidden class transitions , dynamic code generation , and precise garbage collection .
; Tabs Tabs are the primary component of Chrome 's user interface and as such have been moved to the top of the window rather than below the controls -LRB- similar to Opera -RRB- .
Existing implementations were designed `` for small programs , where the performance and interactivity of the system were n't that important '' but web applications like Gmail `` are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to DOM manipulations and Javascript '' .
Each tab has its own set of controls , including the Omnibox URL box .
To reduce exposure to attack , plugins are run in separate processes that communicate with the renderer , itself operating at `` very low privileges '' in dedicated per-tab processes .
; Omnibox The Omnibox is the URL box at the top of each tab , based on the one in Opera .
; Popups Popup windows `` are scoped to the tab they came from '' and will not appear outside the tab unless the user explicitly drags them out .
This shows thumbnails of the eight most visited web sites along with the sites most often searched , recent bookmarks and recently closed tabs . This concept appeared first with Opera 's Speed Dial .
Google Chrome is an open source web browser made by Google .
Tabs -LRB- including their state -RRB- can be seamlessly transferred between window containers by dragging .
The name comes from the graphical user interface frame , or `` chrome '' , of web browsers .
The minimize , maximize and close window buttons are based on Windows Vista ; Gears Chrome includes Gears which adds developer features that may or may not become web standards , typically relating to the building of web applications -LRB- including offline support -RRB- .
Following the principle of least privilege , each process is stripped of its rights and can compute but ca n't write files or read from sensitive areas -LRB- eg documents , desktop -RRB- , this is similar to `` Protected Mode '' that is used by Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista .

Most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which can not be detected by present methods . This has been named dark matter .
They differ in their gravitational effects .
Other experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics .
Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another , producing photons , a small residue of matter survived , giving the present matter-dominated universe .
In effect , this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density .
The word Universe comes from the Old French word Univers , which comes from the Latin word universum .
These elementary particles interact via at most three fundamental interactions : the electroweak interaction which includes electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force ; the strong nuclear force described by quantum chromodynamics ; and gravity , which is best described at present by general relativity .
An easy way to think of this is a group of separate soap bubbles , in which people living on one soap bubble can not interact with those on other soap bubbles .
The longer a photon has been traveling , the more expansion it has undergone ; hence , older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red-shifted .
According to the general idea of relativity , some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe , due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space .
However , on smaller length-scales , matter is observed to form ` clumps ' , many atoms are condensed into stars , most stars into galaxies , most galaxies into galaxy groups and clusters and , lastly , the largest-scale structures such as the Great Wall of galaxies .
However , the universe may have more dimensions and its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology .
Thus , a very rough estimate from these numbers would suggest there are around one sextillion -LRB- 1021 -RRB- stars in the observable universe ; though a 2003 study by Australian National University astronomers resulted in a figure of 70 sextillion -LRB- 7 x 1022 -RRB- .
It is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are ; yet we can never interact with them , even in principle .
Later philosophers such as Lucretius , Averroes , Avicenna and Baruch Spinoza altered or refined these divisions . For example , Averroes and Spinoza have active principles governing the Universe which act on passive elements .
In Aristotle 's book The Physics , Aristotle divided Ï Î Ï Î Î 1\/2 -LRB- everything -RRB- into three roughly analogous elements : matter -LRB- the stuff of which the Universe is made -RRB- , form -LRB- the arrangement of that matter in space -RRB- and change -LRB- how matter is created , destroyed or altered in its properties , and similarly , how form is altered -RRB- .
Nuclear reactions among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei , particularly hydrogen , deuterium , and helium .
The Universe seems to be governed throughout by the same physical laws and physical constants .
Thus , although the energy density of the universe is now dominated by matter , it was once dominated by radiation ; poetically speaking , all was light .
By traveling , an observer can come into contact with a greater region of space-time than an observer who remains still , so that the observable universe for the former is larger than for the latter .
According to one common terminology , each `` soap bubble '' of space-time is denoted as a universe , whereas our particular space-time is denoted as the Universe , just as we call our moon the Moon .
The idea of special relativity is thought to hold in all of the universe , provided that the spatial and temporal length scales are sufficiently short ; otherwise , general relativity must be applied .
According to the prevailing Standard Model of physics , all matter is composed of three generations of leptons and quarks , both of which are fermions .
For example , radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space , even if the Universe would exist forever ; space may expand faster than light can traverse it .
Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and , more generally , the Big Bang idea .
Nevertheless , its predictions appear to be consistent with observations , so there is no reason to adopt another theory .
Accurate predictions of the universe 's past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation .
Typical galaxies range from dwarf galaxys with as few as ten million -LRB- 107 -RRB- stars up to giants with one trillion -LRB- 1012 -RRB- stars , all orbiting the galaxy 's center of mass. .
Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental physical cosmology .
We can not see space beyond the limitations of light -LRB- or any electromagnetic radiation -RRB- .
Several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid cosmic inflation of the universe occurred very early in its history -LRB- roughly 10 â 35 seconds after its creation -RRB- .
The Latin word was used by Cicero and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern English word is used .
Independent estimates -LRB- based on measurements such as radioactive dating -RRB- agree , although they are less precise , ranging from 11 â `` 20 billion years to 13 â `` 15 billion years .
According to general relativity , space can get bigger faster than the speed of light , but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light .
Recent observations also suggest that the cosmological constant -LRB- Î -RRB- is not zero and that the net mass-energy content of the universe is dominated by a dark energy and dark matter that have not been characterized scientifically .
The Universe appears to have no net electric charge , and therefore gravity appears to be the dominant interaction on cosmological length scales .
The density of atoms is about a single hydrogen atom for every four cubic meters of volume .
In principle , the other unconnected universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of space-time , different forms of matter and energy , and different physical laws and physical constants , although such possibilities are currently speculative .
The best good guess of the Universe 's age is 13.73 Â 0.12 billion years old , based on what was seen of the cosmic microwave background radiation .
The entire collection of these separate space-times is denoted as the multiverse .
This refers to an early Greek model of the Universe . In that model , all matter was in rotating spheres centered on the Earth ; according to Aristotle , the rotation of the outermost sphere was responsible for the motion and change of everything within .
The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein 's field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales .
The relative amounts of different chemical elements â '' especially the lightest atoms such as hydrogen , deuterium and helium â '' seem to be identical in all of the universe and throughout all of the history of it that we know of .
The properties of dark energy and dark matter are not known .
It was natural for the Greeks to assume that the Earth was stationary and that the heavens rotated about the Earth , because careful astronomical and physical measurements -LRB- such as the Foucault pendulum -RRB- are required to prove otherwise .
For comparison , the diameter of a typical galaxy is only 30,000 light-years , and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is only 3 million light-years .
The absence of net charge and momentum would follow if the universe were finite .
Usually the Universe is thought to be everything that exists , has existed , and will exist .
Since these are unknown in exact detail , cosmological models have been based on the cosmological principle , which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .
The rate of this spatial expansion is accelerating , based on studies of Type Ia supernovae and other data .
The prevailing Big Bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above , such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies , the universal ratio of hydrogen : helium atoms , and the ubiquitous , isotropic microwave radiation background .
This mass-energy appears to consist of 73 % dark energy , 23 % cold dark matter and 4 % ordinary matter .
On the average , space is very nearly flat -LRB- close to zero curvature -RRB- , meaning that Euclidean geometry is experimentally true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe .
Earlier stages in the development of the universe can be seen at great distances . Observations suggest that the universe has been governed by the same physical laws and constants throughout most of its extent and history .
According to the prevailing theory , a slight imbalance of matter over antimatter was present in the universe 's creation , or developed very shortly thereafter .
Nevertheless , even the most rapid traveler may not be able to interact with all of space .
This all-embracing definition was not adopted by most later philosophers , but something similar is in quantum physics .
As the universe expanded , its energy density decreased and it became cooler ; as it did so , the elementary particles of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations .
General relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric -LRB- Einstein 's field equations -RRB- that must be solved from the distribution of mass-energy and momentum throughout the universe .
The best theory available is Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity , which has passed all experimental tests so far .
Physical laws were the rules governing the properties of matter , form and their changes .
The universe is commonly defined as everything that exists . It includes all kinds of physical matter and energy , the planets , stars , galaxies , and all the contents of space .
There is no explanation for the particular values that physical constants appear to have throughout our Universe , such as Planck 's constant h or the gravitational constant G. Several conservation laws have been identified , such as the conservation of charge , conservation of momentum , conservation of angular momentum and conservation of energy .
There are probably more than 100 billion -LRB- 1011 -RRB- galaxies in the observable universe .
The Universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum .
As the universe expands , the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter , since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength .
This getting bigger accounts for how Earth-bound pople can see the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away , even if that light has traveled for only 13 billion years ; the very space between them has expanded .
Although many scientists , including Einstein , had speculated that Î was zero , recent astronomical observations of type Ia supernovae have detected a large amount of dark energy that is accelerating the universe 's expansion .
Other observations are not clearly answered by known physics .
This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted ; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey .
The distances between the spinning galaxies increase with time , but the distances between the stars within each galaxy stay roughly the same , due to their gravitational interactions .
Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does , and thus slows the expansion of the universe ; by contrast , dark energy serves to accelerate the universe 's expansion .
Time is not considered in Eriugena 's definition ; thus , his definition includes everything that exists , has existed and will exist , as well as everything that does not exist , has never existed and will never exist .
As noted above , the redshift arises from the metric expansion of space ; as the space itself expands , the wavelength of a photon traveling through space likewise increases , decreasing its energy .
The spatial region within which we can affect and be affected is denoted as the observable universe .
However , since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on cosmological length scales , general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate .
Preliminary studies suggest that this dark energy is related to a positive Î , although alternative theories can not be ruled out as yet .
The most common term for `` Universe '' among the ancient Greek philosophers from Pythagoras onwards was Ï Î Ï Î Î 1\/2 -LRB- The All -RRB- , defined as all matter -LRB- Ï Î Î Î '' Î Î 1\/2 -RRB- and all space -LRB- Ï Î Î Î Î 1\/2 Î Î 1\/2 -RRB- .
Typically , the observable universe is taken to mean the universe observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy .
Strictly speaking , the observable universe depends on the location of the observer .
Depending on its sign , the cosmological constant can either slow -LRB- negative Î -RRB- or accelerate -LRB- positive Î -RRB- the expansion of the universe .
The universe seems to have much more matter than antimatter .
Eventually , the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms , which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation ; at this point , the radiation decoupled from the matter , forming the ubiquitous , isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today .
Einstein 's field equations include a cosmological constant -LRB- Lamda : Î -RRB- , that is related to an energy density of empty space .
It is possible to form space-times , each existing but not able to touch , move , or change -LRB- interact with each other .
The Universe appears to have a smooth space-time continuum made of three spatial dimensions and one temporal -LRB- time -RRB- dimension .
Thus , in the early part of the matter-dominated era , stable protons and neutrons formed , which then associated into atomic nuclei .
At this stage , the matter in the universe was mainly a hot , dense plasma of negative electrons , neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei .
The Universe is huge and possibly infinite in volume .
The present overall density of the Universe is very low , roughly 9.9 Ã -- 10 â 30 grams per cubic centimetre .
The most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the Big Bang theory . The Universe expanded from a very hot , dense phase called the Planck epoch , in which all the matter and energy of the Universe was concentrated .
A different interpretation -LRB- way to interpret -RRB- of unvorsum is `` everything rotated as one '' or `` everything rotated by one '' .
This animation illustrates a closed Friedmann universe with zero cosmological constant Î ; such a universe oscillates between a Big Bang and a Big Crunch .
This definition says that the Universe is made of two elements : space and time , together known as space-time or the vacuum ; and matter and different forms of energy and momentum occupying space-time .
As an example , our Milky Way Galaxy is roughly 100,000 light years in diameter , and our nearest sister galaxy , the Andromeda Galaxy , is located roughly 2.5 million light years away .
The matter that can be seen is spread throughout the universe , when averaged over distances longer than 300 million light-years .
A similar definition of the term Universe is everything that exists at a single moment of time , such as the present or the beginning of time , as in the sentence `` The Universe was of size 0 '' .
In a solar system , astronomers believe a planet must be in the habitable zone to have life . The circumstellar habitable zone is an area around a star where a planet would be able to have liquid water .
The area in a solar system where life is most likely is called the circumstellar habitable zone -LRB- CHZ -RRB- . The places in a galaxy where life is most likely is called the galactic habitable zone -LRB- GHZ -RRB- .
The habitable zone may also be called the `` life zone '' , `` comfort zone '' , `` green belt '' or `` Goldilocks Zone '' -LRB- because it 's neither too hot nor too cold , but `` just right '' -RRB- .

Scientists have got new evidence , based on new and better ways of finding dates , using optically stimulated luminescence and Uranium-thorium dating of megafaunal bones . This suggests that humans were the main cause of the extinction of megafauna in Australia .
Climate change , which made the country much drier during an Ice Age about 18,000 years ago , may have also have led to the extinction of the megafauna .
The dates show that the last of the megafauna became extinct around the same time , about 47,000 years ago . This was the time in which humans first arrived in Australia .
Scientists have studied oxygen and carbon isotopes from teeth of megafauna . These show sudden , drastic , non-climate-related changes in plants , and in the diet of surviving marsupial animals , as well as the loss of megafaunal species .
It is possible when humans came to Australia -LRB- around 48,000-60 ,000 years ago -RRB- , and began hunting and using fire , they may have caused the extinction of the megafauna .

While certainly affiliated with the `` House of Set , '' the Nephthys temple at Sepermeru and its apportioned lands -LRB- several acres -RRB- clearly were under administration distinct from the Set institution -LRB- cf . ` Land Tenure in the Ramesside Period ' by S. Katary , 1989 -RRB- .
A near life-sized statue of Nephthys -LRB- currently housed in the Louvre -RRB- boasts a curiously altered inscription .
To be certain , the House of Nephthys was one of fifty individual , land-owning temples delineated for this portion of the Middle Egyptian district in Papyrus Wilbour .
The Papyrus Bologna records a complaint lodged by a prophet of the temple of Set in that town regarding undue taxation in his regard .
After making an introductory appeal to `` Re-Horakhte , Set , and Nephthys '' for the ultimate resolution of this issue by the royal Vizier , the prophet -LRB- named Pra 'em hab -RRB- laments his workload .
He notes his obvious administration of the `` House of Set '' and adds : `` I am also responsible for the ship , and I am responsible likewise for the House of Nephthys , along with a heap of other temples . ''
-LRB- Isis -RRB- was married to Osiris . Isis and Nephthys had a strong relationship .
The basalt image originally was stationed at Medinet-Habu , as part of the cultic celebration of the Pharaonic `` Sed-Festival , '' but obviously was transferred at some point to Herakleopolis and the temple of Herishef therein .
The Ramesside Pharaohs were particularly devoted to Set 's prerogatives and , in the 19th Dynasty , a temple of Nephthys called the `` House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun '' was built or refurbished in the town of Sepermeru , midway between Oxyrhynchos and Herakleopolis , on the outskirts of the Fayyum and quite near to the modern site of Deshasheh .
The fields and other holdings belonging to Nephthys 's temple were under the authority of two Nephthys-prophets -LRB- named Penpmer and Merybarse -RRB- and one -LRB- mentioned -RRB- wa ` ab priest of the goddess .
The foundations of the Set and Nephthys temples at Sepermeru finally were discovered and identified in the 1980s , and the Nephthys temple was no mere chapelâ '' rather , it was a notable , self-sustaining temple complex within the Set enclosure -LRB- cf . ` Les Deesses de l'Egypte Pharaonique ' , R. LaChaud , 1992 , Durocher-Champollion -RRB- . Likewise , there can be little doubt that a cult of Nephthys existed in the temple and great town of Herakleopolis , north of Sepermeru .
Interestingly , yet another -LRB- probably contemporaneous -RRB- temple of Nephthys seems to have existed in the town of Punodjem .
The cult-image 's inscription originally pertained to `` Nephthys , Foremost of the Sed -LRB- Festival -RRB- in the Booth of Annals '' -LRB- at Medinet-Habu -RRB- , but was re-inscribed or re-dedicated to `` Nephthys , Foremost of the -LRB- Booths of -RRB- Herakleopolis . ''
In any event , as `` Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun , '' the goddess and her shrine -LRB- s -RRB- were under the particular endorsement of Ramesses II .
Likewise , there can be little doubt that a cult of Nephthys existed in the temple and great town of Herakleopolis , north of Sepermeru .
The Nephthys temple was a unique establishment in its own right , an independent entity .
Here , as Papyrus Wilbour notes in its wealth of taxation records and land assessments , the temple of Nephthys was a specific foundation by Ramesses II , located in close proximity to -LRB- or within -RRB- the precinct of the enclosure of Set .

Belaying is a way to hold and control a rope for a person who is rock climbing .
A person on the ground who is belaying is called a belayer .
If the climber falls , the device lets the belayer also hold the rope still , so the climber hangs in the air but does not hit the ground .
The belayer can hold the whole weight of the climber by using only a little force , and can even stop a long fall .
The belayer usually puts the rope through a belay device , which lets the rope move through the device in one direction -LRB- as the climber being belayed goes up -RRB- .

Captain Joseph Brant and a group of Iroquois left New York to settle in Canada .
Within each of the six nations , people are divided into a number of matrilineal clans .
A central government that makes policy and puts it into practice for the people at large is not how the Iroquois handle government .
During spring , maple syrup was tapped from the trees , and herbs were gathered for medicine .
However , after a series of successful operations against frontier settlements â `` led by the Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant , other war chiefs , and British allies â `` the future United States wanted revenge .
They fished salmon , trout , bass , perch and whitefish .
When anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan studied the Grand Council in the 19th century , he thought it was a central government .
Evidence from archaeology shows that Iroquois ancestors lived in the Finger Lakes region from at least 1000 AD .
The League still exists .
Today , the Iroquois live mostly in New York and Canada .
This is said to have occurred at Onondaga Lake near Syracuse , New York .
After the the Europeans arrived , many Iroquois became Christians , among them Kateri Tekakwitha , a young woman of Mohawk-Algonkin parents .
He is the only one of the fifty to have been chosen by the entire Haudenosaunee people .
According to this view , Iroquois political and diplomatic decisions are made on the local level , and are based on what the local communities think .
In actuality , few Iroquois joined the campaign , and in the Battle of Lake George , a group of Mohawk and French ambushed a Mohawk-led British column .
The Iroquois , also known as the Haudenosaunee or the `` People of the Longhouse '' , are a group of several tribes of indigenous people of North America .
This interpretation became influential , but some scholars have since argued that while the Grand Council served an important ceremonial role , it was not a government in the way that Morgan thought .
The first Iroquois League was often known as the Five Nations , as it was made up of the Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga and Seneca .
The Confederacy broke up after the defeat of the British and allied Iroquois nations in the American Revolutionary War .
When the soil eventually became less fertile , the Iroquois moved .
According to tradition , the League was formed through the efforts of two men , Deganawida , sometimes known as the Great Peacemaker , and Hiawatha .
Symbolically , the Mohawk guarded the eastern door , as they lived in the east closest to the Hudson River , and the Seneca guarded the western door of the `` tribal longhouse '' , the land they controlled in New York .
Women could own property including homes , horses and farmed land , and when they married , they could keep their property without it being given to their husbands .
In the spring the Iroquois netted , and in the winter fishing holes were made in the ice .
Muskrat and beaver were hunted during the winter .
This suggests that while the different Iroquoian tribes had the same historical and cultural origin , they came apart over a long enough time that their languages became different .
The number of clans varies by nation , currently from three to eight , with a total of nine different clan names .
According to legend , an evil Onondaga chieftain named Tadodaho was the last to be converted to the ways of peace by The Great Peacemaker and Hiawatha .
The Grand Council of the Iroquois League is an assembly of 50 Hoyenah -LRB- chiefs -RRB- or Sachems , a number that has never changed .
The Iroquois hoped that helping the British would also bring favors after the war .
There were about 30,000 tribal registrations among the Six Nations in the United States in 1995 .
In 1779 , George Washington ordered the Sullivan Campaign led by Col. Daniel Brodhead and General John Sullivan against the Iroquois nations to `` not merely overrun , but destroy , '' the British-Indian alliance .
In the 2000 census , 80,822 people in the United States said they were Iroquois , with 45,217 of them claiming only an Iroquois background .
Women had responsibility for the children of the marriage , and children were educated by members of the mother 's family .
Joseph Louis Cook offered his services to the United States and received a Congressional commission as a Lieutenant Colonel - the highest rank held by any Native American during the war .
When Americans and Canadians of European descent began to study Iroquois customs in the 18th and 19th centuries , they found that women assumed a position in Iroquois society that was about equal in power to that of the men .
The Great Peacemaker -LRB- Deganawida -RRB- was their prophet .
After the war , the ancient central fireplace of the League was made again at Buffalo Creek .
Important festivals were at the same time as the major events of the agricultural calendar , including a harvest festival of thanksgiving .
During the French and Indian War -LRB- the North American part of the Seven Years ' War -RRB- , the Iroquois took the side of the British against the French and their Algonquian allies , both of whom had been enemies of the Iroquois in the past .
Traditionally , the Iroquois were a mix of farmers , fishers , gatherers and hunters , although most of their food came from farming .
He became the spiritual leader of the Haudenosaunee .
As a reward for their loyalty to the British Crown , they were given a large land grant on the Grand River in Ontario .
The nations who joined the League were the Seneca , Onondaga , Oneida , Cayuga and Mohawk .
A woman choosing to divorce a husband who was not being a good husband was able to ask him to leave the dwelling , taking any of his possessions with him .
After the people who spoke Iroquoian came together as different tribes , which were mostly in what is now central and upstate New York , in the 16th century or earlier they came together in an group known today as the Iroquois League , or the `` League of Peace and Power '' .
A husband lived in the longhouse of his wife 's family .
Today , the seats on the Council are distributed among the Six Nations as follows :
Members of the League speak Iroquoian languages that are very different from those of other Iroquoian speakers .
The food was stored during the winter , and it lasted for two to three years .
These crops are grown strategically .
When Europeans first arrived in North America , the Iroquois lived in what is now the northeastern United States , mostly in what is today upstate New York , west of the Hudson River and through the Finger Lakes region .
The title Tadodaho is still used for the league 's spiritual leader , the fiftieth chief , who sits with the Onondaga in council .
The British government made the Royal Proclamation of 1763 after the war , which said that white people could not live past the Appalachian Mountains , but this proclamation was largely ignored by the settlers , and the Iroquois agreed to move this line again at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 , where they sold the British all their remaining claim to the lands between the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers .
Gathering was the job of the women and children .
The chief of a clan could be removed at any time by a council of the mothers of that clan , and the chief 's sister was responsible for nominating the next chief .
If a couple broke up , the woman kept the children .
The Iroquois League has also been called the Iroquois Confederacy .
Some modern scholars now think the League and the Confederacy are different .
The Onondaga , who lived in the center of Haudenosaunee territory , were keepers of the League 's -LRB- both literal and figurative -RRB- central flame .
It implies that the nations of the League should live together as families in the same longhouse .
Councils of the mothers of each tribe were held separately from the men 's councils .
The Iroquois hunted mostly deer but also other game such as wild turkey and migratory birds .
About 45,000 Iroquois lived in Canada in 1995 .
The women used men as runners to send word of their decisions , or a woman could appear at the men 's council to speak , presenting the view of the women .
According to their tradition , The Great Peacemaker came up with the name at the time the League was formed .
The Iroquois call themselves the `` Haudenosaunee '' , which means `` People of the Longhouse , '' or more accurately , `` They Are Building a Long House . ''
The main crops they farmed were corn , beans and squash , which were called the three sisters and were considered special gifts from the Creator .
Fishing was also a big source of food because the Iroquois lived near a large river -LRB- St. Lawerence River -RRB- .
The French colonists called the Haudenosaunee by the name of Iroquois .
It is difficult to figure out exactly how many Iroquois there are today .
After coming together in the League , the Iroquois invaded the Ohio River Valley in present-day Kentucky to find more hunting grounds .
The clans were matrilineal , which means that clan ties were traced through the mother 's line .
After the Tuscarora nation joined the League in 1722 , the Iroquois became known as the Six Nations .
The first five nations listed below formed the original Five Nations -LRB- listed from south to north -RRB- ; the Tuscarora became the sixth nation in 1720 .
The current Tadodaho is Sid Hill of the Onondaga Nation .
During the American Revolution , many Tuscarora and the Oneida took the side of the colonists , while the Mohawk , Seneca , Onondaga and Cayuga remained loyal to Great Britain . This was the first major split among the Six Nations .
Traditional Iroquois religious beliefs became somewhat more popular again in the second half of the 18th century by the teachings of the Iroquois prophet Handsome Lake .
They brought a message , called the Great Law of Peace , to the fighting Iroquoian nations .
Once they stopped most of their fighting , the Iroquois fast became one of the strongest forces in 17th - and 18th-century northeastern North America .
In 1855 , Minnie Myrtle saw that no Iroquois treaty came into effect unless it was approved by 75 % of the male voters and 75 % of the mothers of the nation .
Civitavecchia is a city in the region of Lazio , Italy .
It is 80 km north of Rome . It has a sea port .
When these rings were discovered by a team led by Edward Guinan , originally they thought that the rings may not be complete rings .
After reviewing the documents , some historians now think that Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier .
In England , Challis suggested the name Oceanus .
The largest , and the only one big enough to have the shape of a sphere is Triton , -LRB- pronounced : Ë traÉ tÉ n -RRB- discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself .
From July to September 1989 , Voyager 2 discovered six new moons of Neptune .
The moon was credited for causing Neptune 's ring arcs when Voyager 2 observed Neptune in 1989 .
French almanacs promptly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus and Leverrier for the new planet .
Comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets , scientists think the extreme course may be characteristic of flows in the interior of the planet and not the result of Uranus ' sideways rotational movement .
Neptune has a total of 13 known moons .
A very small outward expansion to the Leverrier Ring has been named Lassell ; it is surrounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000 km .
NASA 's Voyager 2 probe made a quick flyby of the planet with its closest encounter on August 25 , 1989 , and was the last planet to have been visited by at least one spacecraft .
Neptune can not be seen with naked eye alone , since Neptune 's normal brightness are between magnitudes +7.7 and +8.0 , which can be out-shined by Jupiter 's Galilean moons , the dwarf planet Ceres , and the asteroids 4 Vesta , 2 Pallas , 7 Iris , 3 Juno and 6 Hebe .
But Galileo was not credited for the discovery since he thought Neptune was a `` fixed star '' instead of a planet . Because of Neptune 's slow movement across the sky , Galileo 's small telescope was not strong enough to detect Neptune as a planet .
A telescope or strong binoculars will show Neptune as a small blue dot , similar in appearance to Uranus .
At 10.243 kg , Neptune 's mass puts the planet between Earth and the largest gas giants ; Neptune has seventeen Earth masses but just 1\/18th the mass of Jupiter .
The pictures sent back to Earth from Voyager 2 in 1989 became the basis of a PBS all-night program called Neptune All Night .
It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous orbit , and is slowly moving into Neptune and will one day be torn apart when it passes the Roche limit .
Shortly after its discovery , Neptune was temporarily called as `` the planet exterior to Uranus '' or as `` Le Verrier 's planet '' .
Uranus and Neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to Jupiter and Saturn , but are rather ice giants , meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices .
In 1989 , the Great Dark Spot , a cyclonic storm system the size of Eurasia , was discovered by NASA 's Voyager 2 spacecraft .
The Scooter is another storm , a white cloud group more south than the Great Dark Spot .
Challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in August , failing to recognize it owing to his careless approach to the work .
Neptune was then discovered that very night on September 23 , 1846 , within 1 Â of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be , and about 10 Â from Adams ' prediction .
Neptune , is the eighth and last planet from the Sun in the Solar System .
Some discovered planets that have similar masses like Neptune are often called as `` Neptunes '' . just as astronomers refer to various extra-solar `` Jupiters . ''
It originally was completely dark , but as Voyager came closer to the planet , a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images .
Although it is the second most massive Neptunian moon , it has only one quarter of one percent of the mass of Triton .
Neptune 's blue color is much brighter compared to Uranus ' , which has a similar amount of methane , so there might be another reason why Neptune is blue .
Important absorption bands of methane happen at wavelengths above 600 nm , in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum .
Neptune 's planetary rings have a weird `` clumpy '' arrangement . Although the cause is currently unknown but some scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near them .
Struve gave support of that name on December 29 , 1846 , to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences .
Neptune 's second known moon -LRB- by order of distance -RRB- , the odd moon Nereid , has one of the most unusual orbits of any satellite in the solar system .
Like Uranus , the source of this heating is unknown , but the differences are larger : Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun , yet its internal energy is strong enough to create the fastest winds seen in the Solar System .
Neptune also has similarities with Uranus in its magnetosphere , with a magnetic field strongly tilted comparative to its rotational axis at 47 Â and offset at least 0.55 radii -LRB- about 13,500 kilometres -RRB- from the planet 's physical center .
Five new unusual moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004 .
The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter .
Soon Neptune was internationally agreed among many people and was then the official name for the new planet .
This absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane gives Neptune its blue hue .
Later , an international agreement decided that both Le Verrier and Adams together deserved credit .
Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system , with temperatures of â ' 235 Â C -LRB- 38 K , â ' 392 Â F -RRB- .
Later images showed clouds that moved even faster than Scooter .
However , on November 2 , 1994 , the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet .
Unlike all other large planetary moons , Triton has a retrograde orbit , showing that the moon was probably captured , and maybe was once a Kuiper belt object .
Several other rings were discovered by the Voyager cameras . Also with the thin Adams Ring about 63,000 km from the center of Neptune , the Leverrier Ring is at 53,000 km and the wider , smaller Galle Ring is at 42,000 km .
Although Heinrich d'Arrest was still a student at the Berlin Observatory , he suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky , in the region of Le Verrier 's predicted area , could be compared with the current sky to look for the displacement characteristic of a planet , as compared to a fixed star .
The atmosphere of Neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen , with a smaller amount of helium .
The gravitational effects of Galatea , a moon just inward from the ring , are now thought to have created the arcs .
The existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time .
In 1821 , Alexis Bouvard published the astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus .
Neptune 's closest four moons , Naiad , Thalassa , Despina , and Galatea , orbit close enough to be inside Neptune 's rings .
In 1843 , John Couch Adams calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that would possibly be influencing the orbit of Uranus .
After the news of the discovery of Neptune spread , there was also a lot of arguing between the French and the British about who was to be deserved credit for the discovery .
In Roman mythology , Neptune was the god of the sea , identified with the Greek god , Poseidon .
Deeper inside the layers of gas , however , the temperature rises slowly .
Its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the Voyager encounter in 1989 : it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot .
The first suggestion for a name came from Galle . He proposed the name Janus .
Neptune once had a huge storm known as the `` Great Dark Spot '' which was discovered in 1989 by Voyager 2 .
Instead , a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet 's northern hemisphere .
The next farthest out , Larissa was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star .
Neptune and Uranus are often considered to be part of a sub-class of gas giant known as `` ice giants '' , given their smaller size and big differences in composition compared to Jupiter and Saturn .
The Wizard 's eye\/Dark Spot 2 is another southern cyclonic storm , the second most strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter .

Leading the horses through the forest to a stream each day , Pascal developed the habit of riding bareback naked through the Hungarian countryside .
Thus , soon after his death , his estate , which had been worth nothing on his deathbed , grew to an estimated value of two million dollars .
During air raids the crew and cast had to dodge into bomb shelters .
He then sought out Shaw , first by going to N.Y. hidden in the toilet of the train , then convincing a sea captain to give him a lift to England .
Elsie had been killed by a bomb .
He was one of the most extravagant men of his time , named in 1938 as one of the world 's most famous men by Time Magazine along with Adolf Hitler .
Meher Baba nicknamed Pascal `` Phoenix '' and alternately `` Panther . ''
He was impressed when Pascal immediately did so and this began their friendship .
It is unclear what parts of his fabulous account of his childhood are true as there are no formal records of him prior to the age of 17 when he was enlisted in military school in Holics , Hungary by a mysterious Catholic Priest .
He claimed to have memories of being rescued by Gypsies from a burning building when he was a tiny child and that the Gypsies taught him to beg , steal , and do acrobatic tricks , but no one knows if this is true .
He was having an affair and divorcing his wife at the time .
By the time Pascal arrived in India , however , Meher Baba did not seem in any hurry to complete the film , saying it could wait and inviting Pascal to live with him in India .
Pascal got very caught up in this project , bringing movie writers Hy Kraft and Karl VollmÃ ller into helping him work up treatments and even making a trip to India to discuss the project further with Meher Baba .
Somehow he did convince Shaw to give him the rights to his plays , beginning with `` Pygmalion '' -LRB- 1938 -RRB- , which was an enormous international hit , both critically and financially .
His directorial debut was Populi Morituri in which he also starred .
Most ordinary men would have been discouraged , but Pascal took energetically to the austere life of an eastern ascetic , even shedding his western garb for eastern clothing .
He is even less known for his lifelong devotion to spiritual master Meher Baba .
This was an absurd gesture since Pascal was totally in debt .
Then it struck him to approach George Bernard Shaw -LRB- the most famous living playwright in the English speaking world at the time -RRB- , whom Pascal had met auspiciously many years earlier .
Pascal even invented the famous line for Pygmalion , later appearing in the theatrical and film versions of My Fair Lady , `` The Rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain '' and Shaw , by now publicly referring to Pascal as a `` genius , '' wrote the line into the script .
In 1933 , during a trip to Hollywood , Pascal was contacted by Princess Norina Matchabelli about a film project based on the teachings of her guru Meher Baba .
Several Meher Baba followers were involved in his life at the end including Harold Rudd who testified at his trial .
His odd last will and testament on the Hotel stationary was entered as evidence in support of his mistress and the case was well-publicized .
The film 's director asked him to repeat the ride for the cameras and he joined the group .
As a young man , Pascal found a job tending horses in Hungary .
Pascal followed up `` Pygmalion '' with `` Major Barbara '' -LRB- 1941 -RRB- which he directed as well as produced .
But Pascal became more and more extravagant , finally losing his credibility with `` Caesar and Cleopatra '' -LRB- 1945 -RRB- which was the most expensive British movie ever made at that time and a terrible financial and critical flop , although it is more highly regarded today .
He took a liking to Meher Baba and maintained a correspondence with him all of his life .
By this time he was increasingly sick with cancer of the liver .
In spring of 1954 , in New York City , just before his passing Pascal had planned a trip to India to see Meher Baba one last time .
Soon he was making his own movies .
After Pascal 's death , Valerie married the famous publisher and philanthropist George T. Delacorte Jr. and spent the rest of her life supporting charitable foundations under the name Valerie Delacorte .
Pascal did manage to produce one more movie , '' Androcles and the Lion '' in 1952 .
During that earlier meeting Shaw , who had been impressed with the young Pascal 's passion for art and cinema , had told him to pay him a visit when he was entirely penniless .
Pascal remained in contact with his guru Meher Baba right up to the end of his life and met with him in person one last time in New York in 1952 .
He landed in San Francisco where he spent some time deciding what to do next .
He is less known for his deep interest in the spiritual and his boundless enthusiasm for art as a direct and honest route to God .
His life is well documented in the beautifully written biography by his wife Valerie , `` The Disciple and His Devil , '' published by McGraw-Hill in 1970 and republished by iUniverse in 1984 .
A conversation ensued and Shaw dared the young Pascal on the shore to take off his clothes and join him in the water .
His wife Valerie attempted to pay back the borrowed option money to Margaret Scott but by the time the settlement came through Mrs. Scott had fallen from a New York apartment window to her death .
Pascal had another auspicious encounter when he was young while walking along the shore of the Mediterranean .
Pascal began his producing career making silent movies in Italy for German distribution through UFA Studios in Berlin .
The result of the trial was an even split of Pascal 's royalties from `` My Fair Lady '' between the mistress and Pascal 's estranged wife , each receiving well over one million dollars in settlement .
Gabriel Pascal , who was decidedly unfit for military life , became interested in theater and studied at the Academy of the Hofburg Theater in Vienna .
In time , however , Pascal 's desire to make his mark on cinema returned and Pascal took a ship back to America penniless but undaunted .
Later his interest expanded into the newly burgeoning cinema and he made films in Germany and Italy with sporadic success .
One day he accidentally rode stark naked through the outdoor set of a silent movie in production and was `` discovered . ''
Unable to care even for himself , Pascal fled to Holland .
He died within a short time of this letter in July , 1954 , and within two years of his death the musical `` My Fair Lady , '' which Pascal had managed to retain an option on by borrowing money from a Baba follower named Margaret Scott , opened on Broadway .
Pascal never stopped the production and the film was completed on schedule .
One day he impulsively wrote on a piece of Hotel stationary to his mistress , `` If I die on my trip to India I leave my entire estate to you . ''
`` Major Barbara '' was filmed in London during the bombing by the Nazis .
Pascal was now exactly that .
After the success of `` Pygmalion '' , which was shortened in its transition from stage to screen , as plays generally are , he increasingly refused to let his plays be cut .
Shaw was impressed with Pascal 's youthful enthusiasm for art and his bravado and invited him to come visit him one day when he was entirely broke .
It was an anthology of short spookie stories , including by Edgar Allan Poe , tied together by the adventures of a black cat and is considered by some to be a forgotten horror classic .

-LRB- 5 -RRB- The next year , Random House quickly published the hardcover edition , with additional Steadman illustrations ; The New York Times said it is `` by far the best book yet on the decade of dope '' , -LRB- 6 -RRB- with Tom Wolfe describing it as a `` scorching epochal sensation '' .
The first trip spawned from an exposÃ Thompson was writing for Rolling Stone magazine about the Mexican-American television journalist Ruben Salazar , whom officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Office had shot and killed with a tear gas grenade fired at close range during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War in 1970 .
The two needed a more comfortable place to discuss the story and decided to take advantage of a Sports Illustrated magazine offer to write photograph captions for the annual Mint 400 desert race being held in Las Vegas .
Rolling Stone magazine cover by Ralph Steadman .
Besides attending the attorneys ' conference , Thompson and Acosta looked for ways in Vegas to explore the theme of the American Dream , which was the basis for the novel 's second half , which Thompson referred at the time as `` Vegas II '' .
The 1971 Thompson and Acosta personae , on which Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo were basedThompson wrote that he concluded their March trip by spending some thirty-six hours alone in a hotel room `` feverishly writing in my notebook '' about his experiences .
Weeks later , Thompson and Acosta returned to Las Vegas to report for Rolling Stone on the National District Attorneys Association 's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs being held from the 25th to the 29th of April 1971 , and to add material to the larger Fear and Loathing narrative .
Thompson was using Acosta â '' a prominent Mexican-American political activist and attorney â '' as a central source for the story , and the two found it difficult for a brown-skinned Mexican to talk openly with a white reporter in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles , California .

What originally was a two-hundred-fifty-word photo-caption-job for Sports Illustrated grew to a novel-length feature story for Rolling Stone ; Thompson said publisher Jann Wenner had `` liked the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication â '' which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it '' .

They thought that by adding a turbine to turn the supercharger , it would yield a `` turbosupercharger '' .
The turbocharger will heat when running . Many recommend letting the engine idle for several minutes before shutting the engine off .
World Rally Car racers have long preferred turbocharged engines . They offer a very high power-to-weight ratios .
During the First World War French engineer Auguste Rateau fitted turbochargers to Renault engines powering various French fighters with some success .
Turbocharging is very common on diesel engines in automobiles , trucks , locomotives , ships , and heavy machinery .
If there is too much exhaust gas sent to the turbine , the compressor can create too much pressure .
Some car builders aviod turbo lag -LRB- below -RRB- by using two small turbos .
Turbochargers can be damaged by dirty or poor oil . Most manufacturers recommend more frequent oil changes for turbocharged engines .
Early builders of turbochargers called them as `` turbosuperchargers '' .
A turbocharger is a form of supercharger . It increases the density of air entering the engine to create more power .
Because they are smaller , they reach their optimal boost more quickly .
The first example of a turbocharged motorcycle is the 1978 Kawasaki Z1R TC .
The turbocharger was invented by Swiss engineer Alfred BÃ 1\/4 chi .
A supercharger is an air compressor used for forced air into an engine .
The first production car with parallel twin turbochargers was the Maserati Biturbo of the early 1980s .
The first production turbo diesel automobiles were the Mercedes 300SD with a Garrett turbocharger , and the Peugeot 604 . Both were introduced in 1978 .
In 1918 , General Electric engineer Sanford Moss attached a turbocharger to a Liberty aircraft engine .
Formula One had a `` Turbo Era '' from until .
In 1987 , the FIA decided to limit the maximum boost of the turbos .
The directly-driven compressor in a supercharger does not have from this problem .
The time required for the turbo to build up the needed pressure is called turbo lag .
Porsche first used this technology in 1985 in the Porsche 959 .
The first successful turbocharged racing engine appears to have been in 1952 . Fred Agabashian in a diesel-powered Cummins Special qualified for the pole position at the Indianapolis 500 .
Diesels are particularly suitable for turbochargers for several reasons :
The seconds turbo will only start working at higher RPM .
This is noticed as a hesitation in engine response .
the FIA decided that turbochargers were making the sport too dangerous and expensive .
A turbocharger , or turbo , is a gas compressor . It is used for to force air into an internal combustion engine .
A turbocharger consists of a turbine and a compressor . They are both mounted on the same shaft .
Today , most automotive diesels are turbocharged .
This setup of turbos is normally called a parallel twin-turbo system .
A turbocharger has the compressor powered by a turbine . The turbine is driven by the exhaust gas from the engine .
The turbocharged engines took over the F1 field . They ended the Ford Cosworth DFV era in the mid 1980s .
It converts exhaust heat and pressure to rotational . This rotation is used to turn the compressor .
Turbocharged cars dominated the 24 Hours of Le Mans between 1976 and 1988 , and then from 2000-2007 .
Lag can be reduced by using lighter parts .
The engine was tested at Pikes Peak in Colorado at 14000 f. The test was to show that the turbo could add the power airplanes lose at high altitude . Internal combustion engines lose power because at high altitude , the outside air pressure is low .
It used a Rayjay ATP turbo kit to build 0.35 bar -LRB- 5 lb -RRB- of boost . This raised the power up from 90 h to 105 h. It was only slightly faster than the standard model .
The term `` turbosupercharged '' is sometimes used to refer to an engine that uses both a crankshaft-driven supercharger and an exhaust-driven turbocharger . This is also called twincharging .
A turbocharger is a small fan pump that spins around a shaft . The pump is driven by the pressure of the exhaust gas .
Diesel ships and locomotives with turbochargers began appearing in the 1920s .
This was during the height of the oil crisis . The 911Turbo was the first production sports car with exhaust turbocharger and pressure regulator .
The Oldsmobile Cutlass Jetfire was fitted with a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger and the Chevrolet Corvair Monza Spyder with a TRW turbocharger .
The first production turbocharged automobile engines came from General Motors in 1962 .
His patent was applied for use in 1905 .
The term was soon shortened to `` turbocharger '' .
Offenhauser 's turbocharged engines first came to Indianapolis in 1966 . Their first victorie came in 1968 using a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger .
Because the turbos are smaller , they do not have as much turbo lag . The second turbo will be able get to full speed before it is required .
This setup is normally called a sequential twin-turbo .
Using turbochargers to increase performance was very appealing to the Japanese builders in the 1980s .

A team of biologists developed an ecological land classification system for the World Wide Fund for Nature -LRB- WWF -RRB- that identified 14 biomes , called major habitat types , and further divided the world 's land area into 867 terrestrial ecoregions .
The Endolithic biome , consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock pores and cracks , kilometers beneath the surface , has only recently been discovered and does not fit well into most classification schemes .
This classification is used to define the Global 200 list of ecoregions identified by the -LRB- WWF -RRB- as priorities for conservation .
Bailey subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981 , and the world in 1989 .

The biodiversity characteristic of each biome , especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant plant forms , is a function of abiotic factors and the biomass productivity of the dominant vegetation .
Climate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes .
Biomes are often given local names .

In February 2005 , the Socialist Party announced plans to contest the 2005 parliamentary elections as part of a new electoral alliance called the Socialist Green Unity Coalition .
For a while , the party was known as Militant Labor .
Their demand for the nationalisation of the one hundred and fifty top British companies and their longstanding practice of running in elections has led some critics to label them as reformists though the party insists that their method is based on Trotsky 's Transitional Programme .
The Socialist Party is affiliated to the Committee for a Workers International , and is indeed the largest of its forty members .
The National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers -LRB- RMT union -RRB- held a conference in January 2006 to address what it calls ` The crisis in working class representation ' , in which Dave Nellist was invited to speak .
In 1997 , the group changed its name to the Socialist Party , but the ownership of this name has been contested by the much older Socialist Party of Great Britain .
As a result , the new party is frequently known as `` The Socialist Party of England and Wales '' .
Since ending their tenure in the Socialist Alliance , the Socialist Party has run candidates in elections as Socialist Alternative .
The result was that the experiment of operating as an `` open party '' was first undertaken in Scotland under the name of Scottish Militant Labor .
Most of the speakers were in favor of a broad left alternative to New Labor .
The party participates also in the broader European Anticapitalist Left .
Following the UK local elections , 2006 , it has three councillors in Coventry , one in Stoke , two in Lewisham , South London and one in Huddersfield .
The remaining speakers , such as MP John McDonnell , wished it well .
In November 2005 at its annual ` Socialism ' event , the Socialist Party formally launched the ` Campaign for a New Workers ' Party ' with the aim of persuading individuals , campaigners and trade unions to help set up and back a new broad left alternative to New Labor that would fight for working class people .
They were one of the founders of the local Socialist Alliance groups , but they left in 2001 .
This debate ran alongside a parallel debate on the future of Scottish politics .
Several former components of the Socialist Alliance that did not join Respect also joined the SGUC .
There was a debate with the Militant Tendency as to whether or not to cease working within the Labor Party and the majority of the group decided to do so , although a minority around Ted Grant broke away to form Socialist Appeal .

Marija Gimbutas even argues that `` the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC , as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates '' .
By that time , the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized .
The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena ; both are said to have worn it as a pendant .
Around 500 BC , they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings , but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles -LRB- antefix -RRB- of smaller buildings throughout the next century .
There is a similar image from the Knossos palace , dating from the 15th century BC .
The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman .
She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image .
Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly , strange or frightening .
Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC .
These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo .
The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities , making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods .
Up to the 5th century BC , the head was shown as being very ugly , with her tongue sticking out , boar tusks , puffy cheeks , her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her .
Jane Ellen Harrison , on the other hand , claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks . These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong , or , as she terms it , to make an ugly face at him .
As well as temples , the Gorgon image can be found on dress , dishes , weapons , and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast .
Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions , but only about the head , as if the creature had no body .
On mosaic floors , the gorgoneion was usually near the door , as if guarding it . On Attic kilns , a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents .
Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily ; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse .
In Ancient Greece , the Gorgoneion -LRB- Greek : Î `` Î Ï Î Ï Î 1\/2 Î Î Î Î 1\/2 -RRB- was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon 's head .
In the 6th century BC , gorgoneia of a basic type of `` lion mask '' were found all over Greek temples , especially in and around Corinth .
Jane Ellen Harrison notes that `` Medusa is a head and nothing more ... a mask . ''
The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times , especially in the Byzantine Empire , including Kievan Rus -LRB- now the Ukraine -RRB- . The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists .
Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns .
The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art . .
In the 20th century , the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company .
Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of of the Mother Goddess cult linked to `` dynamic life energy '' .
It is found in the region Provence-Alpes-C Ã te d'Azur in the Vaucluse department in the south of France .
At 27 years of age , Pierce was the youngest U.S. Representative at that time .
Franklin Pierce rose to a central position in the Democratic party of New Hampshire and was elected to the lower house in New Hampshireâ s General Court in 1828 .
After he entered , he felt homesick and returned home .
Pierce served in the State House from 1829 to 1833 and also served as Speaker from 1832 to 1833 .
These and more triggered a series of events known as `` Bleeding Kansas '' .
Then in 1832 , Franklin was elected Democrat to the 23rd and 24th of Congress from March 4 , 1833 , to March 4 , 1837 .
Consequently , his father then put him in a wagon , drove him half way back to school , and left him on the roadside without saying a word .
Pierce was admitted to the bar and began law practice in Concord , New Hampshire , in 1827 .
Later that year , he was transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy to prepare for college .
Pro-slavery Border Ruffians , mostly from Missouri , illegally voted in a government . Pierce recognized this and called the Topeka Constitution , set up by Free-Staters , as an act of â rebellion .

Similar interchanges occurred earlier in the Cainozoic , when the former Gondwana continents of India and Africa made contact with Eurasia , about 50 and 30 mya respectively .
Unfortunately , the defensive adaptations of the large xenarthrans would have been useless against humans armed with spears and other projectiles .
The pyrotheres and astrapotheres were also strange but were less diverse and disappeared earlier , well before the interchange .
Through the skies over late Miocene South America -LRB- 6 Ma ago -RRB- soared the largest flying bird known , the teratorn Argentavis , with a wing span of 6 m or more , which may have subsisted in part on the leftovers of Thylacosmilus kills .
The borhyaenids and the sabertooth Thylacosmilus are no longer considered to be marsupials . They are sparassodont metatherians , the sister group of the marsupials .
The xenarthrans did not need to be fleet-footed or quick-witted to survive .
The North American fauna was typical northern eutheria -LRB- supplemented with Afrotherian proboscids -RRB- .
The explanation for their success lies in part in their defense against predation . This was based on body armor and\/or formidable claws .
The endemic mammals initially consisted of metatherians -LRB- including marsupials , xenarthrans , and a diverse group of South American ungulates .
The interchange is visible from both stratigraphy and nature .
In addition to those extant today -LRB- armadillos , anteaters and tree sloths -RRB- , a great diversity of larger types were present , including pampatheres , the ankylosaur-like glyptodonts , various ground sloths , some of which reached the size of elephants -LRB- e.g. Megatherium -RRB- , and even semiaquatic sloths .
One living South American marsupial , the tiny Monito del Monte , is more closely related to Australian marsupials than to other South American marsupials . Since it is the most ` basal ' -LRB- = primitive -RRB- australidelphian we know , its group probably evolved in South America and then colonized Australia .
Wallace had spent 1848 â `` 1852 exploring and collecting specimens in the Amazon Basin .
The interchange as a concept was first fully laid out in 1876 by the `` father of biogeography '' , Alfred Russel Wallace .
The ability of South America 's xenarthrans to compete effectively against the northerners represents a special case .
Both groups started evolving in the Lower Paleocene , possibly from condylarth stock , diversified , dwindled before the great interchange , and went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene .
Sparassodonts were the only South American mammals to specialize as carnivores . Their relative inefficiency created openings for nonmammalian predators to play more prominent roles than usual -LRB- similar to the situation in Australia -RRB- .
Their low metabolic rate in turn allowed them to subsist on less abundant and\/or less nutritious food sources .
Such a strategy may have been forced on them by their low metabolic rate -LRB- the lowest among the therians -RRB- .
The volcanic Isthmus of Panama rose up from the sea floor and bridged the two continents .

Following the attack of the Axis powers on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 , and the quick defeat of the Yugoslav army -LRB- Jugoslovenska vojska -RRB- , the whole country was occupied by Axis forces .
The coup failed and its conspirators were executed .
In August 1944 , there was an attempt by Foreign Minister in NDH government Mladen LorkoviÄ and Minister of War Ante VokiÄ to execute a coup d'etat against Ante PaveliÄ .
They were soon overpowered and the Independent State of Croatia -LRB- NDH -RRB- effectively ceased to exist in May 1945 , near the end of the war .
Before meeting Hitler , to appease the public , PaveliÄ published the `` Important Government 's Announcement '' -LRB- Â '' VaÅ 3\/4 na obavijest VladeÂ `` -RRB- in which he threatened those who were spreading the news `` about non-existent threats of disarmament of the Ustashe units by representatives of one foreign power , about the Croatian Army replacement by a foreign army , about the possibility that a foreign power would seize the power in Croatia ...

Tonal languages such as Chinese and Hausa use pitch to distinguish words in addition to intonation .
Intonation and stress are two main elements of linguistic prosody .
-LRB- Compare tone . -RRB-
-LRB- â -- Ë Ë haÊ dÉ djuË Here , as is common with wh - questions , there is a rising intonation on the question word , and a falling intonation at the end of the question .
In the International Phonetic Alphabet , `` global '' rising and falling intonation are marked with a diagonal arrow rising left-to-right -LRB- â -- -RRB- and falling left-to-right -LRB- â -RRB- , respectively .
Some languages like Chikasaw and kalaallisut have the opposite pattern : rising for statements and falling with questions .
often have a rising end , but not always .
-LRB- hiË Ë faÊ nd É t Here the rising pitch on street indicates that the question hinges on that word , on where he found it , not whether he found it .
-LRB- â Ë jÉ s â -- hi Ë faÊ nd É t
Yes , he found it on the street .
and statements -LRB- He found it on the street . -RRB- .
These may be written as part of a syllable , or separated with a space when they have a broader scope :
He found it on the street ?
All languages use pitch semantically , that is , as intonation , for instance for emphasis , to convey surprise or irony , or to pose a question .
, and a falling intonation for wh - questions -LRB- Where did he find it ? -RRB-
The classic example of intonation is the question-statement distinction .
How did you ever escape ?
Yes or no questions -LRB- Did he find it on the street ? -RRB-
In linguistics , intonation is variation of pitch while speaking which is not used to distinguish words .
Dialects of British and Irish English vary substantially , with rises on many statements in urban Belfast , and falls on most questions in urban Leeds .
Moreover , some evidence suggests that Earth 's original atmosphere might have had a different composition than the gas used in the Millerâ `` Urey experiment .
After Miller 's death in 2007 , scientists examined sealed vials preserved from the original experiments . They were able to show that there were well over 20 different amino acids produced in Miller 's original experiments .
Considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life , it was conducted in 1952 and published in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey at the University of Chicago .
That is considerably more than those Miller originally reported , and more than the 20 that naturally occur in life .
There is abundant evidence of major volcanic eruptions 4 billion years ago , which would have released carbon dioxide , nitrogen , hydrogen sulfide -LRB- H2S -RRB- , and sulfur dioxide -LRB- SO2 -RRB- into the atmosphere .
The Miller and Urey experiment -LRB- or Ureyâ `` Miller experiment -RRB- was an experiment to make organic compounds out of inorganic ones by applying a form of energy .
Experiments using these gases in addition to the ones in the original Millerâ `` Urey experiment have produced more diverse molecules .
Specifically , the experiment tested Alexander Oparin 's and J.B.S. Haldane 's hypothesis that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized organic compounds from inorganic precursors .

The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 split what little land remained in the Empire into new countries , the ultimate winner being Nicaea .
A century later , in 395 AD , it was permanently split into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire .

The stated intention of ASALA was `` to compel the Turkish Government to acknowledge publicly its alleged responsibility for the deaths of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 , pay reparations , and cede territory for an Armenian homeland '' .
The group 's activities were primarily assassinations of Turkish diplomats and politicians in Western Europe , in the United States and the Middle East .
According to Dr Tessa Hofmann , Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with the ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left-wing Turkish opposition groups .

Weinberg 's contributions were unrecognized in the English speaking world for more than 35 years .
His lecture was printed later that year in the society 's yearbook .
Weinberg pioneered studies of twins , and developed techniques to analyze phenotypic variation . His aim was to partition this variance into genetic and environmental components .
Weinberg is also credited as the first to explain the effect of ascertainment bias on observations in genetics .
Additional contributions by Weinberg to statistical genetics included the first estimate of the rate of twinning . Realizing that identical twins would have to be the same sex , while non-identical twins could be either same or opposite sex , Weinberg derived the formula for estimating the frequency of MZ and DZ twins from the ratio of same and opposite sex twins to the total of maternities .
Weinberg also estimated that the heritability of twinning itself was close to zero .
Weinberg observed that proportions of homozygotes in familial studies of classic recessive genetic diseases generally exceed the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:4 , and he explained how this is the result of ascertainment bias .
Weinberg was born in Stuttgart and studied medicine at Tübingen and Munich , receiving an M.D. in 1886 .
Curt Stern , a German geneticist who immigrated to the United States before World War II , pointed out in a brief paper in Science that Weinberg 's exposition was both earlier and more comprehensive than Hardy 's .
For example , he explained that the reason that parents as a whole are more fertile than their children is because children must necessarily come from fertile parents .
Much of his academic life was spent studying genetics , especially on applying the laws of inheritance in populations .
In his work with albino children , he recognized that in some families where both parents carry a recessive mutation , by chance no albino child occurs .
Weinberg developed the principle of genetic equilibrium independently of British mathematician G.H. Hardy .
Weinberg recognized that this was because those later generations were the offspring of that selected group of earlier carriers that had successfully reproduced .
By the same token , he recognized that ascertainment was responsible for a phenomenon known as genetic anticipation , the tendency for a genetic disease to manifest earlier in life and with increased severity in later generations .
In the process , he recognized that ascertainment bias was affecting many of his calculations , and he produced methods to correct for it .

A single Dalek appeared in `` Dalek '' , written by Robert Shearman , which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005 . This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of a Time War that had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords .

These Daleks and their fleet were reduced to subatomic particles in `` The Parting of the Ways '' .

Before the second game got underway , the press agreed that the `` midget-in-a-cake '' appearance had not been up to Veeck 's usual plan .
American League president Will Harridge , saying Veeck was making a mockery of the game , voided Gaedel 's contract the next day .
Falstaff personnel , who had been promised national publicity for their participation , did not like the idea .
-LRB- Gaedel reportedly said , `` I do n't want to be taken to your leader .
I 've already met him . '' -RRB-
Edward Carl `` Eddie '' Gaedel -LRB- June 8 , 1925 -- June 18 , 1961 -RRB- , born in Chicago , Illinois , was an American man who was a midget who became famous for playing in a Major League Baseball game .
In 1961 , Veeck hired several dwarves and midgets , including Gaedel , as vendors , so as not to `` block the fans ' view '' of the game .
With Bob Cain on the mound - laughing at the absurdity that he actually had to pitch to Gaedel - and Swift catching on his knees , Gaedel crouched with bat in hand .
The contract had been filed late in the day on Friday , August 17 .
Gaedel 's autograph now sells for more than Babe Ruth 's because of what he did .
Said Cain : `` I never even met him , but I felt obligated to go . ''
Keeping the surprise , he had in store for the second game to himself , Veeck apologized .
His total earnings as a pro athlete were $ 100 , the scale price for an AGVA appearance .
Mitauer 's inquiry was shunted aside by the Browns ' publicity man .
Veeck knew the league office would summarily approve the contract receipt , and that it would not be scrutinized until Monday , August 20 .
Veeck humorously threatened to request an official ruling on whether Yankees shortstop and reigning MVP Phil Rizzuto was a short ballplayer or a tall midget .
The change to that day 's St. Louis Browns scorecard , listing Gaedel , was not seen by anybody except Harry Mitauer , a writer for the St. Louis Globe-Democrat .
Gaedel gained immortality in the second game of a doubleheader on Sunday , August 19 , 1951 .
Falstaff , and the fans , had been promised a `` festival of surprises '' by Veeck .
He was relisted a year later .
Combative in his private life , he later became a heavy drinker and died of a heart attack after being mugged in Chicago in 1961 .
Veeck had dearly hoped that Delsing would go on to score in a one-run Browns victory , but he ended up stranded at third base and the Tigers went on to win the game 6-2 .
-LRB- As a result of Gaedel 's appearance , all contracts must now be approved by the Commissioner of Baseball before a player can appear in a game . -RRB-
Weighing just 65 pounds -LRB- 29.5 kg -RRB- , and 3 feet 7 inches -LRB- 1.09 m -RRB- tall , he became the shortest player in the history of the major league baseball .
In his autobiography `` Veeck as in Wreck , '' Bill Veeck commemorated Gaedel as `` the best darn midget who ever played big-league ball . ''
The only baseball figure to attend the funeral was Bob Cain , the pitcher who had walked him .
Gaedel 's major league career lasted just the one plate appearance , but Veeck continued to employ Gaedel in non-playing promotions over the years : in 1959 , Gaedel and three other dwarves dressed as spacemen were seen presenting `` ray guns '' to White Sox players Nellie Fox and Luis Aparicio at Comiskey Park .
Gaedel popped out of a papier-m Ã cents chÃ cake between games of a doubleheader to celebrate the American League 's 50th anniversary , and as a Falstaff Brewery promotion .
Veeck and Taylor had the foresight to have a copy of Gaedel 's contract on hand , as well as a copy of the Browns ' active roster , which had room for Gaedel 's addition .
When Gaedel had hinted to Veeck that he might be tempted to swing at a pitch , the owner promised to bring a rifle to the game and shoot him if he tried .
Immediately , umpire Ed Hurley called for Browns manager Zack Taylor .
Cain delivered four consecutive balls , all high .
However , he was able to parlay his baseball fame into more than $ 17,000 by appearing on several television shows .
Eddie Gaedel entered the game between the Browns and Detroit Tigers as a pinch-hitter for leadoff batter Frank Saucier .
The 18,369 fans gave Gaedel a standing ovation .
Gaedel took his base -LRB- stopping twice during his trot to bow to the crowd -RRB- and was replaced by pinch-runner Jim Delsing .
Eddie Gaedel finished his major league career with an on-base percentage of 1.000 .
Initially , major league baseball struck Gaedel from its record book , as if he had not been in the game .
Eddie Gaedel was under strict orders not to attempt to move the bat off his shoulder .
Reading the contract , Hurley motioned for Gaedel to take his place in the batter 's box .

However , some have argued that the stripes were influenced by the flag of the United States .
There are a lot of reasons for the earliest history of the flag of Hawaii .
The original flag was designed to feature stripes alternating in the order red-white-blue .
The flag used at the first official flying of the flag of Hawaii erroneously placed the stripes in the order white-red-blue .
The arrangement was adopted and is used today .
The field of the flag is composed of eight horizontal stripes symbolizing the eight major islands .
The colors were in 1843 , although other combinations have been seen and are occasionally still used .
An adviser to Kamehameha noted that the Union Flag could draw Hawaii into international problems as his kingdom could be seen as an ally of the United Kingdom , and he quickly lowered the Union Flag over his home .
Other visits reported seeing the flag flying from places of honor .
The flag of Hawaii -LRB- Hawaiian : Ka Hae HawaiÊ '' i -RRB- is the official flag of Hawaii as a U.S. state , as it was kingdom , protector government , republic , and territory .

-LRB- citation needed -RRB- The color of the stripes , from the top down , following this pattern : white , red , blue , white , red , blue , white , red .
A ninth stripe was once included representing the island of Nihoa .
One said how King Kamehameha I flew a British flag , given to him by British explorer Captain George Vancouver as a token of friendship with King George III .
While argued as historically correct , one report of events that followed stated that in order to please American interests during the War of 1812 , a flag of the United States was raised over Kamehameha 's home only to be removed when British officers in the court of Kamehameha powerfully objected to it .

Double-flats and double-sharps are used in music as accidentals , but they are never placed in the key signature -LRB- in music that uses equal temperament -RRB- , because it would make reading the key signature very difficult .
So the theoretical key of D minor is usually written with the key signature of C minor .
A piece of Western music usually has a home key , and a passage within it may modulate to another key , which is usually closely related to the home key . -LRB- Usually , close to the original around the circle of fifths . -RRB-
The next modulation , to C has seven sharps .
But the next modulation would be to a theoretical key of G which would need an eighth sharp - for the previous F note to become F in the key signature .
For example , the key of D minor is not usually used to write music down , because its key signature would contain a B. An equal-tempered scale of D minor has exactly the same notes as the C minor scale .
But if the home key is near the bottom of the circle -LRB- a key signature with many accidentals -RRB- , enharmonic equivalence may need to be used because simply adding accidentals will result in a key with too many accidentals to be easy to play or write in .
For example , if a piece in E major were to modulate up a fifth to B major , which is next to it on the circle and on the same side of the circle , the notation is clear and simple ; an extra sharp is added to make five sharps .
But when a relative key is on the opposite side of the circle from its home key , then in theory modulating to that key would involve adding so many sharps or flats that double-sharps and double-flats would have to be written in the key signature .
The following six keys -LRB- which are the parallel major\/minor keys of those above -RRB- would require one , two or three double-sharps or double-flats :
Key pairs like this are called enharmonically equivalent .
When the key is near the top of the circle -LRB- a key signature of zero or few accidentals -RRB- , the writing of both keys is easy - a small number of extra sharps or flats is added .
But when a relative key is on the opposite side of the circle from its home key , then in theory modulating to that key would involve adding so many sharps or flats that double-sharps and double-flats would have to be written in the key signature . The following six keys -LRB- which are the parallel major\/minor keys of those above -RRB- would require one , two or three double-sharps or double-flats :

After months of following her path of the Way of Love , Gabrielle picks up the sword of a paralyzed Xena and fights off a large group Roman soldiers with incredible skill .
Probably what is most impressive , is that two episodes later she blocks an arrow in flight with her staff .
RenÃ e O'Connor was chosen to play the role after she impressed producers with her role in the Hercules television movie The Lost Kingdom .
Her name is the feminine of Gabriel , from the Hebrew , which means `` messenger of God '' . That is the name of the chief of Archangels , and during the show , Gabrielle becomes an Archangel .
Gabrielle takes the loss graciously and continues to grow in skill over the season , regaining the title of supreme Amazon queen very soon .
One of Gabrielle 's biggest fights of the season is her fight against fellow Amazon queen , Varia .
Gabrielle insists on following an initially reluctant Xena on the road .
It is said that their souls are together throughout time .
Awed by her fighting skills , Gabrielle decides that she wants to become a warrior too .
In the opening episode , she displays a remarkable ability to talk her way out of fearsome or difficult situations : she talks a cyclops out of eating her , and makes an ally of him ; talks an old man into giving her a lift ; talks a violent crowd out of killing Xena ; and talks her way into joining Xena as her traveling partner .
About a year into her travels with Xena , her scrolls about Xena 's exploits begin to gain popularity , apparently helping , according to Ares , turn Xena into a legend .
While in India , Gabrielle is also thrown through time by a Darsham to save Xena 's soul .
Other than sai and sometimes a new casual staff , she can use a large array of weapons with proficiency .
The two women soon develop a strong bond of love and friendship .
At the end of season 4 , however , is when Gabrielle shows a leap in her warrior abilities .
Gabrielle starts the series as a young girl who more or less stands behind Xena , and relies on Xena to protect her .
As she travels with Xena , she records their adventures on a series of scrolls , with an eye for flair and drama .
As previously mentioned , Gabrielle 's abilities become noticed by the God of War who seeks her out as his new protÃ gÃ e. It is mentioned later by Gabrielle and numerous others that Xena trained her throughout the years , although there have only been a few episodes that actually show Xena giving her any sort of martial arts training .
According to an episode set in modern times , Gabrielle 's scrolls were preserved for thousands of years and later discovered by modern archeologists .
They found their way to Hollywood , where they formed the basis of the television series .
Over the six years of the series , Gabrielle evolves from a naive , idealistic teenager into a fully fledged , but deeply conflicted warrior fighting alongside Xena .
Despite Gabrielle 's ascendancy as a warrior , her role as a bard remains important .
Gabrielle also fights against warriors with notable skill ; she defeats the warrior Mavican and stands against Ares and Hades -LRB- two gods -RRB- in battle for a rather long period before they defeat her .
She is referred to , by fans , as the Battling Bard of Potidaea .
She also wants to avoid the marriage that her parents , Herodotus and Hecuba , have arranged for her with her childhood friend Perdicas .
They fight in an enclosed arena in a match in which Eve 's life is at stake , and they appeared to be at a stand-off before she is beaten by Varia .
After their 25-year sleep , Gabrielle finds out that her stories had been read as far away as North Africa where they were popular among nomad tribes .
Gabrielle 's bardic skills appear to be natural and self-taught .
She also fights in a sword duel with Brutus , Caesar 's former right hand and one of leaders of Rome , eventually killing him .
Gabrielle is a fictional character in Xena : Warrior Princess , played by RenÃ e O'Connor .
She and her sister Lila , along with several other village girls , have been kidnapped by the men of the warlord , Draco , to be sold as slaves .
Along with Xena , occasionally , Gabrielle is known to be credited with a variety of discoveries and inventions .
Her trademark weapons are the Amazon fighting staff and the sai .
In this next life Xena is the Mother of Peace , Arminestra and Gabrielle is Shakti , a Warrior Prince of India .
Another 10 episodes later , she displays immensely impressive skills with the staff , taking on numerous soldiers single-handedly , in the attempts to rescue Xena 's presumably dead body .
When Gabrielle first meets the Warrior Princess , Xena , she is a farm girl living in the village of Potidaea .
Xena intervenes and rescues them .
By season 5 , we see Gabrielle reach an undisputed status as a warrior , fighting with her sai , incorporating more acrobatic ability , even performing a wall run and back flip .
In other episodes she wins a place in the Athens City Academy for the Performing Bards , is a famous playwright , is a theatrical director , plays the pan pipes with considerable skill , and is the only person able to recite a magical scroll with the correct accents .
Also , the Greek version of `` Gabrielle '' is Î `` Î Î Ï Î Î Î '' Î , -LRB- Gavrila -RRB- .
Occasionally her tendency to exaggerate and glamorize the facts gets her into trouble .
Besides her persuasive ability , she also reads and writes - rare skills for that time , loves to tell stories , and has some musical ability .
She is also shown telling stories for money in an inn .

Its usage in the term lingua franca came from its meaning in Arabic . That word came into use before the Crusades , when Europeans used to be called `` Franks '' or Faranji in Arabic .
The terms working language , bridge language and vehicular language are used in the same sense .
At that time , in the port cities of the Ottoman empire there lived very many Italian speakers .
The term lingua franca is first recorded in English in 1678 .
Franca was the Italian word for Frankish .
A lingua franca -LRB- originally Italian for `` Frankish language '' - see etymology below -RRB- is a language that is used between persons who have not the same mother tongue .
Around the Renaissance era a mixed language of Italian -LRB- 80 % -RRB- and many words from Turkish , French , Spanish , Greek and Arabic was used in the eastern region around the Mediterranean Sea It was in use as the language of commerce and diplomacy and was called lingua franca .

There are three genera of influenza virus : Influenzavirus A , Influenzavirus B and Influenzavirus C. Each genus includes only one species , or type : Influenza A virus , Influenza B virus , and Influenza C virus , respectively .
However , influenza C is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children .
The influenza C virus infects humans and pigs , and can cause severe illness and local epidemics .
Influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen , and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal .
Isaviruses infect salmon ; thogotoviruses infect vertebrates and invertebrates , such as mosquitoes and sea lice .
However , influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible .
Further variation exists ; thus , specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type , geographical location where first isolated , sequential number of isolation , year of isolation , and HA and NA subtype .
The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans , ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths , are :
The Orthomyxoviridae -LRB- orthos , Greek for `` straight '' ; myxa , Greek for `` mucus '' -RRB- are a family of RNA viruses . They include five genera : Influenzavirus A , Influenzavirus B , Influenzavirus C , Thogotovirus and Isavirus .
This reduced rate of antigenic change , combined with its limited host range -LRB- inhibiting cross species antigenic shift -RRB- , ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur .
Influenza A and C infect multiple species , while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans .
As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity , a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age .
Influenza A viruses are further classified , based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin -LRB- HA or H -RRB- and neuraminidase -LRB- NA or N -RRB- . Sixteen H subtypes -LRB- or serotypes -RRB- and nine N subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified .
The first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates , including birds -LRB- see also avian influenza -RRB- , humans , and other mammals .
The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and causes the most severe disease .
This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse , with only one influenza B serotype .
Res Gestae Divi Augusti -LRB- literaly ` The achievements of the divine Augustus ' -RRB- , also known as Res Gestae and RGDA , was an autobiography and epitath written by Emperor Augustus following the tradition of writing about a dead person 's achievements and life but Augustus ' is the biggest by far .

Big ocean ships can get up the river until Manaus , which is almost 1500 kilometers from its mouth .
Smaller ocean ships of 3,000 tons and 7.9 m -LRB- 26 ft -RRB- draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru , 3,700 km -LRB- 2,300 miles -RRB- from the sea .
The estuary also includes the island of MarajÃ , which lies in the mouth of the Amazon .
The Amazon , has the largest drainage basin in the world . It accounts for about one fifth of the world 's total river flow .
This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames in England .
Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km -LRB- 486 mi -RRB- higher as far as Actual Point .
One characteristic of the Amazon river is the Brazo Casiquiare , a water connection to the Orinoco river , that connects the two basins .
While in Asia , Aristotle traveled with Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos , where they researched the botany and zoology of the island .
During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander , but also to two other future kings : Ptolemy and Cassander .
At about the age of eighteen , he went to Athens to continue his education at Plato 's Academy .
Near the end of Alexander 's life , he began to suspect plots , and threatened Aristotle in letters .
However , he died in Euboea of natural causes within the year , 322 BC .
Aristotle is the father of logic .
The works that have survived are in fairly rough form . They are generally thought to be lecture notes for his students .
Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander 's pretense of divinity , and the king had executed Aristotle 's grandnephew Callisthenes as a traitor .
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon .
Some of his important writings are Physics , Metaphysics , -LRB- Nicomachean -RRB- Ethics , Politics , De Anima -LRB- On the Soul -RRB- , and Poetics .
Aristotle 's combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge .
It is during this period in Athens from 335 to 323 when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works .
Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest , and his attitude towards Persia was ethnocentric .
Soon after Hermias ' death , Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander the Great in 343 B.C.
Aristotle wrote many dialogues , only fragments of which survived .

Tayasal is a pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site from the Postclassic period .
In 1541 , HernÃ n CortÃ s came to the island , on route to Honduras , but needed to move on and did not try to conquer it due to its very good defensive position .
Many ItzÃ people hid in the jungle for years .
The Itza left the YucatÃ n region in the 13th century and built the city later known as Tayasal as their capital .
The structures of Noh PetÃ n were turned into the Roman Catholic church and other buildings in the city of Flores .
It was also called Tah ItzÃ , or Place of the ItzÃ .

Crassus was killed , but Cassius managed to escape with 500 cavalry and meet up with the surviving legionaries .
Cassius managed to save the remnants of the army with the help of Crassus ' legate Gaius Octavius .
Although they succeeded in assassinating Caesar , the celebration was short-lived . Mark Antony seized power and turned the public against them .
Cassius was elected Tribune of the Plebs in 49 BC , and threw in his lot with Pompey , fleeing Italy as Caesar crossed the Rubicon .
The conspirators decided to attack the triumviriâ s allies in Asia .
In 48 BC , Cassius sailed his ships to Sicilia where he attacked and burned a large part of Caesar 's navy .
They had one son .
The last incursion resulted in the death of the Parthian commander Osaces , and split the Parthian troops .
Cassius spent the next two years without office , and apparently tightened his friendship with Cicero .
Cassius returned to Rome two years later . The outbreak of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great saved Cassius from being brought to trial by his enemies for extortion in Syria .
They crossed the Hellespont , marched through Thrace , and encamped near Philippi in Macedon .
Octavian -LRB- later known as Augustus -RRB- and Mark Antony soon arrived . Cassius planned to starve them out , by using his superior position in the country .
News of Pompey 's defeat at the Battle of Pharsalus caused Cassius to head for the Hellespont .
In 44 BC he became praetor peregrinus with the promise of the Syrian province for the ensuing year .
Brutus was successful against Octavian , and took his camp .
In letters written during 44 BC , Cicero frequently complains that Rome was still subjected to tyranny , because the `` Liberators '' had failed to kill Antony .
Cassius converted to the school of thought founded by Epicurus .
-LRB- Canto XXXIV -RRB- In Shakespeare 's play Julius Caesar he is depicted as a ruthless manipulator .
`` Among that select band of philosophers who have managed to change the world , '' writes David Sedley , `` it would be hard to find a pair with a higher public profile than Brutus and Cassius â '' brothers-in-law , fellow-assassins , and Shakespearian heroes , '' adding that `` it may not even be widely known that they were philosophers '' .
Cassius quickly joined Brutus in Smyrna with most of his army , leaving his nephew behind to govern Syria .
According to some accounts , Cassius had wanted to kill Antony at the same time as Caesar , but was dissuaded by Brutus .
Crassus ignored Cassius and led the army into the Battle of Carrhae , during which he also ignored Cassius ' plans for strengthening the Roman line .
In Dante 's Inferno , Cassius is one of three people deemed sinful enough to be chewed in one of the three mouths of Satan , in the very center of Hell , for all eternity , as a punishment for killing Julius Caesar .
The other two are Brutus , his fellow conspirator , and Judas Iscariot , the Biblical betrayer of Jesus Christ .
He studied philosophy at Rhodes and became fluent in Greek .
On the Ides of March , 44 BC , Cassius urged on his fellow liberators and struck Caesar in the face .
The result was the most famous Roman rout since the Second Punic War .
Cassius 's first office was as quaestor under Marcus Licinius Crassus in 53 BC , and he proved a good military leader .
Cassius 's reputation in the East made it easy to amass an army from other governors in the area .
The appointment of his junior , Brutus , as praetor urbanus deeply offended him .
He was mourned by Brutus as `` the Last of the Romans '' .
By this point the Senate had split with Antony and cast its lot with Cassius , making him as governor of Syria .
Cassius , unaware of Brutus ' victory , committed suicide .
Cassius was overtaken by Caesar en route , and was forced to surrender unconditionally .
He and his fellow conspirators referred to themselves as the `` Liberators '' -LRB- Liberatores -RRB- .
Caesar says of him , `` Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look ; He thinks too much : such men are dangerous '' .
He met Pompey in Greece , and was made commander of his fleet .
Gaius Cassius Longinus -LRB- before 85 BC â `` October 42 BC -RRB- was a Roman Senator , a leader of the plot to kill Julius Caesar , and the brother in-law of Brutus .
Cassius , however , was defeated and overrun by Antony .
He traveled with Crassus to the province of Syria , and attempted to dissuade him from attacking Parthia , suggesting that they secure a base at the Euphrates .
However , they were forced into a pair of battles by Antony , in the Battle of Philippi .
They regrouped the following year in Sardis , where their armies proclaimed them 'em peror ' .
The inconsistencies between traditional Epicureanism and an active approach to securing freedom could not be resolved , and during the Empire , the philosophy of political opposition tended to be Stoic .
Although Cassius was `` the moving spirit '' in the plot against Caesar , winning over the chief assassins , Brutus became their leader .
He then proceeded to harass ships off the Italian coast .
Little is known of Gaius Cassius 's early life .
Cicero , then governor of Cilicia , sent Cassius a note of congratulations for the victory .
Caesar made Cassius a legate , employing him in the North Africa , but Cassius refused to join in the fight against Cato and Scipio in Africa , choosing instead to retire to Rome .
For two years afterwards , Cassius governed the province of Syria as Proquaestor , defending the border against Parthian incursions until the new proconsul arrived .
Arnaldo Momigliano called Cassius ' conversion a `` conspicuous date in the history of Roman Epicureanism , '' a choice made not to enjoy the pleasures of the Garden , but to provide a philosophical justification for assassinating a tyrant .
This circumstance , Momigliano argues , helps explain why historians of the Imperial era found Cassius more difficult to understand than Brutus , and less admirable .
He was married to Tertulla , who was a half-sister of his co-conspirator , Brutus .
Cassius was now secure enough to march on Egypt , but on the formation of the triumvirate , Brutus requested his assistance .
Cassius set upon and sacked Rhodes , while Brutus did the same to Lycia .

Tropical Storm Harvey was a strong tropical storm that moved across the Atlantic Ocean from August 2 to August 8 .
But a lot of wind shear gave Harvey some subtropical characteristics and also made the official forecasts to underestimate the future strength of the storm .
Harvey formed from a tropical wave to the southwest of Bermuda on August 2 and passed close to Bermuda on August 4 , bringing heavy rain to the island .
Without any notice , more wind shear did not cause Harvey to weaken somewhat , although the storm 's path did become confusing .
As Tropical Storm Harvey came closer to Bermuda , a tropical storm warning was given out late on August 2 .
As it moved northeast away from the island , the storm strengthened more to its strongest with winds of 65 mph -LRB- 100 km\/h -RRB- .

When the wave came across the Leeward Islands on July 28 , the National Hurricane Center began to watch the system closely for any possible strengthening , which did not happen at that time .
As Tropical Storm Harvey came closer to Bermuda , a tropical storm warning was given out late on August 2 . Because it was considered possible for the storm to continue gaining strength , a hurricane watch was given out the next day .
By August 2 , conditions had become more favorable and Tropical Depression Eight formed about 350 miles -LRB- 595 km -RRB- southwest of Bermuda .

Strong wind shear and dry air caused Olga to weaken into a remnant low early on December 13 .
Right after it being classified as a subtropical cyclone , the government of the Dominican Republic gave out a tropical storm warning from Cabo EngaÃ o along the north coast to its border with Haiti ; a tropical storm watch was also issued along the southern coastline to near Santo Domingo .
In the Dominican Republic , officials opened shelters in 15 provinces , with citizens in low-lying areas recommended to stay elsewhere during the passage of the storm ; citizens in 22 communities were evacuated .
Officials instead chose to open all six floodgates at 0400 UTC on December 12 , which released about 1.6 million gallons -LRB- 6.1 million liters -RRB- of water into the river every second .
The storm made landfall on December 11 on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic .
The storm strengthened a little bit while moving right along the north coast of Puerto Rico , and after an increase in convection near the center , Olga made landfall near Punta Cana , Dominican Republic at 1800 UTC on December 11 .
With a strong ridge to its northeast , the trough tracked slowly westward , creating scattered convection and some cyclonic turning .
A Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm reported a tighter wind gradient and peak winds of 60 mph -LRB- 95 km\/h -RRB- , and at 0000 UTC on December 12 the National Hurricane Center reclassified Olga as a tropical cyclone while it was still inland .
On December 10 , the Tropical Prediction Center gave out a gale warning for waters north of the Lesser Antilles , Puerto Rico , and the Dominican Republic , in association with the disturbance that would later become Olga .
It is the first post-season storm since Tropical Storm Zeta in the 2005 season , making this season one of the few with activity both before and after the official bounds of the hurricane season .
After being classified as a subtropical cyclone , Olga kept an organized outflow , and located to the southeast of a strong ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean , the cyclone moved west-southwestward .
Convection quickly weakened as the storm crossed central Hispaniola , and after reaching the Caribbean Sea the system lacked the convection required for the classification of a tropical cyclone ; rainbands well to its northeast had stronger winds , though the center became very disorganized with dry air and strong wind shear .
On December 11 , a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36 mph -LRB- 58 km\/h -RRB- .
In the first week of December , a westward-moving upper-level low led to the formation of a broad surface trough well to the east of the northern Lesser Antilles .

However , the Hutt River Province argues that it is an independent entity within the Australian legal system and the Commonwealth has no right to dispute the claimed de facto legality it was given in error by the Governor General 's office , and its own failure to respond to the claim .
Tourism is also important to its economy with 40,000 tourists visiting the principality every year .
Prince Leonard is married to Her Royal Highness Princess Shirley of Hutt , Dame of the Rose of Sharon -LRB- nÃ e Shirley Butler -RRB- . They have seven adult children , among them is Crown Prince Ian -LRB- born 1947 -RRB- who is the Prime Minister of the Principality , and is Prince Leonard 's heir apparent .
A set of low denomination banknotes was introduced in 1974 .
While the Australian Taxation Office has issued a warning on its website for the public not to purchase companies from the PHR , it has not acted against the principality .
These coins are known as `` holey dollars '' , a nickname which is applied to the extremely rare New South Wales 5 \/ - coin and the Prince Edward Island 5 \/ - coin , which were cut and counterstamped from Spanish-American Pieces of Eight -LRB- 8 Reales -RRB- .
It also provided for an administration board to govern the principality until a permanent government could be set up .
The issuance of coins went on until 2000 , and resumed with new issues beginning in 2007 to celebrate the 60th wedding anniversary of the Prince and Princess .
She is also royal patron and chairwoman on the board of directors of the Red Cross of Hutt .
When Casley declared himself a prince , the administration board was abolished and the Hutt River Principality became a benevolent absolute monarchy , with a legislation committee to draft new legislation .
Although the law in this matter has since changed , the Australian government has not taken any action against Hutt River since the declaration .
After the government threatened him with prosecution , Casley styled himself His Royal Highness Prince Leonard I of Hutt to take advantage of a Commonwealth law that a monarch could not only not be charged , but that anyone who interfered with his duties could be charged with treason .
After approaches to the government to reconsider the acquisition bill failed , Casley and his associates resorted to a British law -LRB- the Treason Act 1495 -RRB- which they felt allowed them to secede and declare their independence from the Commonwealth of Australia .
Casley then lodged a claim under the Law of Tort for $ 52 million in the belief the claim would force a revision of the quota .
In 2010 Brendon Grylls , the Western Australian Minister for Regional Development and Lands , was asked if his state had a position on the province .
In 1976 , Australia Post refused to handle Hutt River mail , forcing mail to be redirected via Canada .
He is also an adherent of hermeticism , a subject on which he has privately published a number of research papers and books .
It is about 75 k in size .
The currency of the Hutt River Province Principality is the Hutt River Dollar , which is divided into 100 cents .
The Governor-General of Australia , Sir Paul Hasluck , later stated that it was unconstitutional for the Commonwealth to intervene in the secession .
Despite his advancing years the prince Leonard is known as a keen-minded `` bush lawyer '' .
The principality had plans to start a university in its territory , which is illegal within Australia .
The Casley farm had around 4000 h of wheat ready to harvest when the quotas were issued which allowed Casley to sell only 1,647 bushels or approximately 40 h. Initially the five families who owned farms in Hutt River banded together to fight the quota and Casley lodged a protest with the Governor of Western Australia Sir Douglas Kendrew .
When the Principality of Hutt River seceded , a bill of rights , a brief document outlining the rights of `` Hutt River '' citizens , was drafted .
In 1997 , the legislation committee presented a proposal for a constitution to the prince and his cabinet .
To overturn this de facto recognition , the West Australian Governor General 's office would have to submit the secession to arbitration , something which the Hutt River Province claims is not done due to legal uncertainty related to the fact that Western Australia in its entirety was never officially proclaimed as British Territory .
Regarding the use of titles , the ambassador said that : `` The Australian Government does not recognize the ` royal titles ' nor titles of office , such as ` Head of State ' , ` State minister ' and ` Minister for Foreign Affairs ' assumed by the family owning the property nor the use of terms such as ` consulates ' and ` principality ' in relation to the ` Hutt River Province ' . ''
Casley states that he nonetheless remains loyal to Queen Elizabeth II .
In September 2006 Prince Leonard decided to change the name to `` Principality of Hutt River '' and dropped the word `` Province '' .
Princess Shirley plays host to the many dignitaries and diplomatic representatives visiting the principality each year as well as receiving many of the television crews and magazine journalists .
There was also a silver $ 30 coin and a gold $ 100 coin , struck only in proof .
In letters with the governor-general 's office , Casley was called the `` Administrator of the Hutt River Province '' by mistake . The Royal Prerogative , makes this recognition binding on all courts .
Following repeated demands by the Australian Taxation Office -LRB- ATO -RRB- for the payment of taxes , on 2 December 1977 the province officially declared war on Australia .
Very few people live in Hutt River , but the principality claims a world-wide citizenry of 13,000 .
Prince Leonard notified authorities of the cessation of hostilities several days later .
The Governor replied `` no rectification of our Quota would be allowed '' which , as he acts as the Queen 's representative , made Her Majesty technically liable , in Tort , for applying an unlawful imposition as the quota had not yet been passed into law .
The principality is located 517 k north of Perth , near the town of Northampton .
While the principality does not pay taxes , the Australian government 's current official position is that it is nothing more than a private enterprise operating under a business name .
The government of Western Australia determined it could do nothing without the intervention of the Commonwealth .
Hutt River citizens are now classed by the ATO as non-residents of Australia for income tax purposes ; thus income earned within the province is exempt from Australian taxation .
Prince Ian is involved heavily in the wildflower production , with the product not only being exported to Perth , Western Australia but to many cities internationally .
Prince Leonard pursued a number of occupations before purchasing a large wheat farm near Northampton , Western Australia and Geraldton , Western Australia in the 1960s .
However , the government authorities did not act against PHR .
The Principality of Hutt River , previously known as the Hutt River Province , is the oldest micronation in Australia .
The Principality of Hutt River is situated 517 k north of Perth along the Hutt River .
Similarly , the PHR does not pay taxes to the ATO .

Every town had its own commune and no two communes were alike , but at the heart , communes were sworn alliegences of mutual defense .
As such communes were sometimes accepted , and other times not by the Church and King .
Because much of medieval Europe lacked central authority to provide protection , such as a police force -LRB- to use a modern analogy -RRB- , each city had to provide its own protection for citizens both inside the city walls , and outside .
Instead they might attack the nobles family , or burn his crops , or kill his serfs , or destroy his orchards .
What did it mean for a commune member to defend another ?
One of the most famous cases of a commune being suppressed and the resulting defiant urban revolt occurred in the French town of Laon in 1112 .
However , what would happen if the attacker was a noble who had a castle , too strong for the townspeople ? This was often the case and certainly the town commune could not muster the forces to attack a castle .
When a commune was formed , all particpitating members gathered and swore an oath together , in public , they would defend each other in time of trouble . In addition they would swear to maintain the peace within the city proper .
Obviously if a commune member was attacked outside the city it was too late to call for help as it would be unlikely anyone would be around in time .
On the other hand , communes disrupted the order of medieval society . The methods the commune used , eye for an eye , violence begets violence , were generally not acceptable to Church or King .
In order to do this towns formed what are called communes .
Normally only the noble lords are allowed to fight and the merchant townspeople were the workers , not fighters .
The Church and King both had mixed reactions to communes .
The walled city was protection from direct assault , but once a townsperson left the city walls , he or she was at the mercy of often violent and lawless nobles in the countryside .
On the one hand they agreed safety and protection from lawless nobles was in everyones best interest .
The communes intention was to keep the peace through the threat of revenge , and the Church was sympathetic to the end result of peace .
Instead the commune would promise to exact revenge on the attacker , the promise of revenge being a form of defense .
However the Church had their own ways to enforce the peace such as the Peace and Truce of God movement , for example .

An analog or analog signal is any continuous signal .
The voltage or the current is said to be an `` analog '' of the sound .
An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal 's information .
For example , in sound recording , fluctuations in air pressure -LRB- that is to say , sound -RRB- strike the diaphragm of a microphone which causes corresponding fluctuations in a voltage or the current in an electric circuit .
The difference from a digital signal is that also very small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful .
When one speaks of analog one often means an electrical context , however mechanical , pneumatic , hydraulic , and other systems may also convey analog signals .
Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal , often such a signal is a measured change in physical phenomena , such as sound , light , temperature , position , or pressure .
See digital for a discussion of digital vs. analog .

The National Parks Act goes on to say that the public will be allowed to enter and use the parks freely , but with rules to avoid destroying the native plants and animals or the parks .
The national parks of New Zealand are 14 protected areas that are looked after by the Department of Conservation `` for the benefit , use , and enjoyment of the public '' .
In 2010 the New Zealand Government proposed removing some national park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 protection of the Crown Minerals Act which means that mining is not allowed in those areas .
It begins by explaining what a national park is :
While the national parks contain some of New Zealand 's most beautiful scenery , the first few that were created were all focused on mountains .
Tongariro National Park is one of 27 World Heritage Sites that is of both cultural and natural significance , and four of the South Island national parks form Te Wahipounamu , another World Heritage Site .
Development in what the act calls `` wilderness areas '' is only foot tracks and huts used for wild animal control or scientific research .
Native plants and animals are to be looked after and other plants and animals removed if they harm the natural wildlife .
This proposal is currently being considered by the Department of Conservation .
The area contains most of New Zealand 's remaining kauri , including the largest known kauri , TÄ ne Mahuta .
These are popular among tourists , with 30 % of tourists visiting at least one national park during their stay in New Zealand .
Other services within the parks , such as guided walks and skiing tutorials , are provided by other companies , sometimes with help from the department .
National parks are soil , water and forest conservation areas , and should be kept as natural as possible .
The National Parks Act of 1980 was written to record what national parks are for , and how they would be chosen and looked after .
The Act allows the Department of Conservation to provide hostels , huts , camping grounds , ski tows and other services , parking areas , roading and tracks within the parks .
As well as these , the department also provides some accommodation , transport and other services at entry points to the parks , but these are also offered by others .
The area around Waipoua Forest , north of Dargaville , was suggested to become a new Kauri National Park .
These stands of kauri are also important because they are homes for many endangered species including the North Island Brown Kiwi .
In July the government decided against the proposal after receiving a large number of submissions , most of which were against mining .
Since the 1980s more different kinds of New Zealand landscapes have been included in the national parks .

In Scotland , traces of this tsunami have been recorded , with deposited sediment being discovered in the Montrose Basin -LRB- estuary of the South Esk river -RRB- , and the Firth of Forth , up to 80 km inland and 4 metres above current normal tide levels .
Based on carbon dating of plant material recovered from sediment deposited by the tsunami , the latest incident occurred around 6100 BC .
As part of the activities to prepare the Ormen Lange natural gas field , the incident has been thoroughly investigated .
It was decided that the development of the Ormen Lange gas field would not significantly increase the risk of triggering a new slide .
This conclusion is supported by numerous scientific studies .
A new slide would trigger a very large tsunami which would be devastating for the coast areas around the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea .
They occurred under water , at the edge of Norway 's continental shelf , in the Norwegian Sea , 100 km north-west of the MÃ re coast .
The three Storegga Slides are amongst the largest known landslides .
The collapse involved an estimated 290 km length of coastal shelf , with a total volume of 3,500 km3 of debris .

In the 1840s , using Newtonian mechanics , Urbain Le Verrier predicted the planet Neptune existed . He discovered this after studying the orbit of Uranus .
In 1906 , Percival Lowell , a person from Boston began an extensive to search the ninth planet . He called it `` Planet X '' .
In the late 1970s , the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people learned that Pluto had a small mass. .
A number of scientists continue to hold that Pluto should be classified as a planet .
On February 18 , 1930 , Tombaugh discovered an object which seemed to move from the photographic plates taken on January 23 and January 29 of the year .
Since it was discovered in 1930 , Pluto was thought to be the Solar System 's ninth planet .
Later , in the early 21st century , the scattered disc object Eris and other objects like Pluto were discovered . Eris is 27 % more massive than Pluto .
This causes Pluto to sometimes go closer to the Sun than Neptune .
After this , Pluto was put on the list of minor planets . It was given the number 134340 .
By this definition , Pluto was not a planet anymore . It became a `` dwarf planet '' along with Eris and Ceres .

The name was announced on May 1 , 1930 .

On August 24 , 2006 , the International Astronomical Union -LRB- IAU -RRB- gave a definition to the word `` planet '' for the first time .
The discovery made headlines across the Earth .
These suggestions were not used .
She suggested it when she was talking with her grandfather Falconer Madan . He was a former librarian at the University of Oxford 's Bodleian Library .
After the observatory did more research about it , news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13 , 1930 .
Constance Lowell proposed Zeus , then Lowell , and finally Constance .
Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did .
Madan passed the name to Professor Herbert Hall Turner .
It is smaller than the largest known dwarf planet , Eris . Its formal name is 134340 Pluto .
Lowell continued the research till 1916 .
It became a `` dwarf planet '' along with Eris and Ceres .
By 1909 , Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested many possible places in the Solar System where the planet could be .
Pluto received all votes .
For this reason , the search for Planet X again started in 1929 . The director of the mission , Vesto Melvin Slipher , gave the job to Clyde Tombaugh , a 23-year-old Kansas man .
The object was officially named on March 24 , 1930 .
Tombaugh 's had to systematically get pictures of the night sky in pairs every two weeks . Then , he had to look at each pair .

Thucydides almost never names his informants .
One of Thucydides ' major innovations was to use a strict standard of chronology , recording events by year , each year consisting of the summer campaigning season and a less active winter season .
The gods play no active role in Thucydides ' work .
This is very different to Herodotus , who frequently mentions the role of the gods .
The History of the Peloponnesian War tells the story of the Peloponnesian War in Ancient Greece .
As a result , events that span several years are divided up and described in parts of the book that are sometimes quite distant from one another , causing the impression that he is oscillating between the various theaters of conflict .
This method contrasts sharply with Herodotus ' earlier work The Histories , which jumps around chronologically .
It was written by Thucydides , an Athenian general who served in that war .
This is in contrast to Herodotus , who frequently mentions multiple versions of his stories and allows the reader to decide which is true .
Instead , Thucydides regards history as being caused by the choices and actions of human beings .
Thucydides ' History made a number of contributions to early historiography .
Thucydides ' History has been enormously influential in both ancient and modern historiography .
Many of his principles have become standard methods of history writing today , though others have not .
Thucydides heard some of these speeches himself but some of the speeches he wrote without knowing exactly what was really spoken .
Another feature of the work is that Thucydides writes dozens of speeches of the most important figures who were engaged in the war .

Now geologists think greywacke is formed by submarine avalanches or strong turbidity currents .
These actions churn sediment and cause mixed-sediment slurries to occur . When this happens , the resulting rocks show various sedimentary features .
The larger grains can be sand-to-gravel-sized , and matrix materials make up more than 15 % of the rock by volume .
It also occurs in association with black shales of deep sea origin .
Support for the turbidity current origin is the fact that deposits of greywacke are found on the edges of the continental shelves , at the bottoms of oceanic trenches , and at the bases of mountain formational areas .
It is mostly found in Palaeozoic strata .

Examples of such embedded devices are the ATMs .
This is called real-time computing .
Consumer electronics include personal digital assistants -LRB- PDAs -RRB- , MP3 players , mobile phones , video game consoles , digital cameras , DVD players , GPS receivers , and printers .
In addition to the embedded operating system , many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components .
Embedded processors -LRB- CPUs -RRB- can be divided into two categories : ordinary microprocessors -LRB- Î 1\/4 P -RRB- and microcontrollers -LRB- Î 1\/4 C -RRB- . Microcontrollers -LRB- Î 1\/4 C -RRB- have many more peripherals on chip , reducing the cost and size .
Complexity varies from very low , with a single microcontroller chip , to very high with multiple microcontroller units with peripherals and networks mounted inside a large chassis or enclosure .
Embedded systems control many of the common devices in use today .
Many household appliances , such as microwave ovens , washing machines and dishwashers , are including embedded systems to provide flexibility , efficiency and features .
Computer networking uses dedicated routers and bridges to route data .
Common examples of embedded monolithic kernels are Embedded Linux and Windows CE .
In this case , a large kernel with complex capabilities and features is used by the embedded system .
Here are some of the reasons :
As the complexity of embedded systems grows , higher level tools and operating systems are moving toward the embedding industry , example of such systems are the open programming environment including Linux , NetBSD , OSGi or Embedded Java , etc.
In this type of system , a certain method is used to switch between tasks or threads based on a timer interrupt .
New airplanes contain advanced avionics such as autopilot , inertial guidance systems and GPS receivers .
This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like Linux or Microsoft Windows , and is therefore very good for development ; However requires more hardware resources , more expensive , and can be less reliable ; because of the complexity of these kernels .
SoCs can be implemented as an application-specific integrated circuit -LRB- ASIC -RRB- or by using a field-programmable gate array -LRB- FPGA -RRB- .
In general , microkernels succeed when the task switching and inter-task communication is fast , and fail when they are slow .
An interrupt could be generated for example by a timer in a predefined frequency , or by a serial port receiving a byte .
Physically , embedded systems range from portable devices such as MP3 players and digital cameras , to large systems like traffic lights , factory controllers , or the systems controlling nuclear power plants .
The loop calls subroutines , each subroutine manages a part of the hardware or software .
Embedded systems use embedded operating systems which are often real-time operating systems .
In this design , the software simply has a loop .
The programmer defines a set of tasks , each task gets its turn to `` run '' , when it finsh it calls a routine to run the next task .
There are several different types of embedded software designs in common use .
Because an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements , the debugging strategy may vary .
Exokernels communicate in a good way by normal subroutine calls .
Unlike `` simple control loop '' systems , adding new software is easier , by simply writing a new task and adding it to the tasks queue .
Sometimes the interrupt handler adds longer tasks to be executed by the main loop .
This means that tasks performed by the system are generated by different kinds of events .
Transportation systems from aeroplanes to automobiles uses embedded systems .
The hardware and software in the system are available to , and extendable by , application programmers .
Therefore the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers , and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives , switches or buttons are avoided .
The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution .
A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution .
However , they may also use some more specific tools :
An increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core .
Embedded Debugging may be performed at different levels , depending on the features available .
Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks , design engineers can optimize it , reducing the size and cost of the product , or increasing the reliability and performance .
A full graphical touch screen having buttons with the meaning of the buttons changing with each screen as in smart phones .
Embedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors , and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs .
Other than the higher price of hardware , many peoples like this type of embedded systems , especially for more powerful devices such as Wireless Routers and GPSs .
From simplest to most complicated they can be grouped into the following areas :
In such a case , the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores , which requires very low-level debugging , at signal\/bus level , with a logic analyzer , for instance .
For example , Mobile devices share some elements with embedded systems â '' such as the operating systems and microprocessors which runs them â '' but are not truly embedded systems , because they allow different applications to be loaded and peripherals to be connected like general-purpose computers .
Some embedded systems are mainly interrupt controlled .
The advantage of this method is that low-cost products and components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development .
Unless restricted to external debugging , the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools , view the code running in the processor , and start or stop its operation .
Telecommunications systems uses huge amount of embedded systems from telephone switches to mobile phone network .
Automobiles , electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles are increasingly using embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution .
At this level the system is considered to have an `` operating system '' kernel and can run tasks in parallel .
Various electric motors are using embedded electronic motor controllers .
A common configuration for very-high-volume embedded systems is the system on a chip -LRB- SoC -RRB- which holds a complete system consisting of -LRB- multiple -RRB- processors , multipliers , caches and interfaces on a single integrated circuit .
Embedded systems range from no user interface at all â '' doing only to one job â '' to complex graphical user interfaces and consoles similar to modern computer with desktop operating systems .
A microkernel is a logical step up from a real-time operating system .
User mode processes implement major functions such as file systems , network interfaces , etc.
These components consists of networking protocol stacks like TCP\/IP , FTP and HTTP , also includes storage features like disk partitioning and Flash memory management systems .
These often use DOS , Linux , NetBSD , or an embedded real-time operating system such as MicroC\/OS-II , QNX or VxWorks .
For instance , debugging a software - -LRB- and microprocessor - -RRB- centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals -LRB- DSP , FPGA , co-processor -RRB- .
PC\/104 and PC\/104 + are examples of available ready made computer boards intended for small , low-volume and high-volume embedded systems .
In certain applications , where small size is un-important , the components used may be like those used in general purpose computers .
A nonpreemptive multitasking system which is very similar to the `` simple control loop '' design , except that the loop is hidden in an API .
Boards such as the VIA EPIA range help to narrow the gap by being PC-compatible , such boards are highly integrated , physically smaller or have other properties which make them attractive to embedded engineers .
As for other software , embedded system designers use compilers , assemblers , and debuggers to develop embedded system software .
The view of the code may be as assembly code or source-code .

Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group , which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world .
The therocephalians are named after their large skulls , which , along with the structure of their teeth , suggest that they were successful carnivores .
Like other non-mammalian therapsids , therocephalians are sometimes described as mammal-like reptiles . In fact Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts , which gave rise to the mammals .

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes ; Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies .
What but Thy grace can foil the tempterâ s power ?
Swift to its close ebbs out lifeâ s little day ; Earthâ s joys grow dim ; its glories pass away ; Change and decay in all around I see ; O Thou who changest not , abide with me .
I need Thy presence every passing hour .
I fear no foe , with Thee at hand to bless ; Ills have no weight , and tears no bitterness .
Heavenâ s morning breaks , and earthâ s vain shadows flee ; In life , in death , O Lord , abide with me .
When other helpers fail and comforts flee , Help of the helpless , O abide with me .
Where is deathâ s sting ?
Abide with me ; fast falls the eventide ; The darkness deepens ; Lord with me abide .
Where , grave , thy victory ?
Who , like Thyself , my guide and stay can be ?

People reported that trains and houses were being searched for ` Anastasia Romanov ' by soldiers and secret police .
Yurovsky quickly told the Tsar and his family that they were going to die .
When she was put in prison for a short time at Perm in 1918 , Princess Helena Petrovna , the wife of Anastasia 's distant cousin , Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia , said that a guard took a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked her if the girl was the Tsar 's daughter .

These people were Maxim Grigoyev , Tatiana Sitnikova and her son Fyodor Sitnikov , Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina , Vassily Ryabov , Ustinya Varankina , and Dr. Pavel Utkin .

As the Bolsheviks came nearer , Alexander Kerensky moved them to Tobolsk , Siberia .
The Tsar , the empress , and two servants were killed in the first round of shooting . Maria , Dr. Botkin and Alexandra 's maid Demidova were hurt .
Because of this , Anastasia 's name means `` the breaker of chains '' or the `` prison opener '' .
On 7 May 1918 , Anastasia wrote a letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg . In the letter , she described a moment of joy , even though she was sad , lonely , and worried about her sick brother Alexei : `` We played on the swing , that was when I roared with laughter -LRB- laughed loudly -RRB- , the fall was so wonderful !
In 2000 , Anastasia and her family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church .
Her legal struggle to be recognized as Anastasia from 1938 to 1970 was a a controversy for her whole life . It was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts .
The most recent film is 1997 's Anastasia . This was an animated musical adaptation of the story of Anastasia 's fictional -LRB- not real -RRB- escape from Russia and how she tried to be recognized .
It had actually been found almost ten years earlier , but had been kept hidden by the people who discovered it . They did not want the Communists , who still ruled Russia at that time , to know where the grave was .
On 14 July 1918 , local priests at Yekaterinburg held a private church service for the family .
Maria 's skull does not have any bullet wounds , though . It is unclear how she died .
Anastasia was murdered with her family on 17 July 1918 by the Bolshevik secret police .
Tatiana wrote to her mother on 8 March 1910 , that she was `` so afr -LRB- aid -RRB- that S.I. -LRB- governess Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva -RRB- can our friend something bad '' .

The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II , Tsarina Alexandra , and three of their daughters were buried in the St. Catherine Chapel at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998 .
`` Do n't forget us . ''
Surprisingly , the rumors that had started to hide the fact that the family was dead helped the rumors that they were alive .
Sometimes they called her `` Anastasie '' , `` Nastya '' , `` Nastas '' , or `` Nastenka '' .
In the autumn of 1907 , Anastasia 's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia went to the nursery with the Tsar to meet Rasputin .
A gunman named Ermakov tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei , but the jewels in the boy 's clothes protected him .
Pierre Gilliard , Sydney Gibbes , and ladies-in-waiting Lili Dehn and Anna Vyrubova said that Anastasia was funny and good at acting .
Olga Alexandrovna said all four of her nieces bled more than was normal . She believed they had the hemophilia gene , like their mother .
Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the back by Anastasia , her mother and her sisters .
Nicholas asked Rasputin not to go into the nursery after that , and Alexandra later fired Tyutcheva .
Her tutor Sydney Gibbes said that Anastasia 's acting made everyone laugh .
A priest took care of two young women who said that they were Anastasia and her sister Maria in the Ural Mountains in 1919 . They lived there as nuns until they died in 1964 .
Hallie Erminie Rives , an American writer , described how Anastasia ate chocolates without taking off her white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house when she was 10-years-old .
They slept on hard camp cots without pillows when they were healthy , took cold baths in the morning , and had to clean their rooms and sometimes sew .
DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B. His mother and one of his sisters were carriers .
Maria , Anastasia , and the maid Demidova were on the floor under the room 's one window .
The movie , Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna , was a series with two parts . It began with the young Anastasia Nicholaievna and her family being sent to Yekaterinburg , where they are killed by Bolshevik soldiers .
The stories of how Anastasia might have escaped became the subject of theatrical and television films .
One sat up and screamed , throwing her arm over her head . The other , bleeding from the mouth , moaned and moved .
This could have been why the ` Perm stories ' began .
Anastasia went to his funeral on December 21 , 1916 . Her family planned to build a church over Rasputin 's grave .
DNA and studies on their skeletons showed that they were the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II , his wife , and three of the Grand Duchesses -LRB- Olga , Tatiana , and Maria -RRB- .
Once at a snowball fight , she rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister , Tatiana .
I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up -LRB- tired -RRB- '' , adding , `` One could simply shout with joy . ''
At Tobolsk , she and her sisters sewed jewels into their clothes . This was because Alexandra , Nicholas and Maria had had their things taken away when they arrived in Ekaterinburg .
Tatiana was killed by a shot to her head .
Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that they had made an investigation to see if what Vishnyakova said was true , but that `` they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard . ''
`` Anastasia '' and `` Alexei '' lived under false names in the Bulgarian town of Gabarevo .
Anastasia , her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns .
Rasputin had written warm , but completely innocent letters to the Tsarina and her four daughters . He released the letters , which made people gossip even more .
The `` Yurovsky Note '' was found in 1989 and described in Edvard Radzinsky 's 1992 book The Last Tsar . The `` Yurovsky Note '' was a description of the event by Yurovsky after the execution .
She was a sister of Grand Duchess Olga , Grand Duchess Tatiana , Grand Duchess Maria , and Alexei Nikolaevich , Tsarevich of Russia .
Later , A.A. Mordvinov reported in his memoirs that the four Grand Duchesses looked `` cold and visibly terribly upset '' by Rasputin 's death . He added that they sat `` huddled up closely together '' on a sofa on the night they heard he was killed .
At that time , it is said that there was a short time when the killed bodies were left in the truck and in the basement of the house .
Thick smoke and dust filled the room from the shooting , so the gunmen left the room for a few minutes .
They could not see me through their windows , and this was to be the last glimpse that I was to have of any of them ! ''
The other remains had different DNA . They were the bodies of the family 's doctor -LRB- Yevgeny Botkin -RRB- , valet -LRB- Alexei Trupp -RRB- , cook -LRB- Ivan Kharitonov -RRB- and Alexandra 's maid -LRB- Anna Demidova -RRB- .
After some time , they begin wondering if `` Madame A. Anderson '' really is the missing Grand Duchess .
Anastasia was also called `` Malenkaya '' , meaning `` little -LRB- one -RRB- '' , or `` shvibzik '' , the Russian word for `` imp '' .
When some of the pieces of bone in the skulls were missing , they guessed how long or wide it was instead .
Anastasia was a Grand Duchess . Because this made Anastasia an `` Imperial Highness '' , she was higher in rank than other Princesses in Europe who were `` Royal Highnesses '' .
In 1994 , a tissue sample from Andersen in a hospital was used for DNA tests with the blood of Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh . Prince Philip was a grandnephew of Empress Alexandra .
Russian scientists did not agree with this . They claimed that it was the body of Maria was missing , not Anastasia 's .
When she did not recognize the girl , the guard took her away .
Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana were known as `` The Big Pair '' , because they shared a room as well .
When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg , the Imperial Family were gone .

Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia was the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his wife Alexandra Fyodorovna . Anastasia was murdered with her family on 17 July 1918 by the Bolshevik secret police .
However , DNA testing in 1994 on pieces of Anderson 's tissue and hair showed that she was not related to the Imperial family .
According to the blouse the hand must have belonged either to the Grand Duchess Marie or Anastasia .
In 1956 , a movie called Anastasia was made . Ingrid Bergman acted Anna Anderson , Yul Brynner was General Bounine -LRB- a fictional character based on several real men -RRB- , and Helen Hayes as the Dowager Empress Marie , Anastasia 's grandmother .
Anastasia and her sisters learned to wash their own clothes and make bread at the Ipatiev House .
Pierre Gilliard remembered his last sight of the children : `` The sailor Nagorny , who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch , passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms , behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings .
Anastasia was executed with her family by a firing squad in the early morning of 17 July 1918 .
Some of these people said that the girl was Anastasia when they saw photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators .
In his memoirs , Alexander Strekotin , one of the guards at the Ipatiev House , called Anastasia `` very friendly and full of fun '' . Another guard said Anastasia was `` a very charming devil !
But the next day , on 15 July 1918 , Anastasia and her sisters seemed happier . They joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that the cleaning women could clean the floors .
She and other members of her family performed plays for their parents and others in the spring of 1918 .
Ermakov told his wife that Anastasia was killed by a bayonet , and Yurovsky wrote that as the bodies were carried out , one or more of the girls cried out and were hit on the back of the head with a club . However , the back of Maria 's skull does not show any signs of having been clubbed .

In October 1917 , the Bolshevik revolution struck Russia . A civil war began shortly after that .
Another time , eight people said that they saw a young woman being captured at a railway station at Siding 37 in September 1918 after trying to escape .
One of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century was if Anastasia had survived or not .
In 1986 , NBC began a mini-series inspired by a book published in 1983 by Peter Kurth called Anastasia : The Riddle of Anna Anderson .
Zamiatkin said that after the rest of the family had been killed , he escaped with the children on a ship .
Nagorny tried to come to her assistance -LRB- help -RRB- ; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ... '' Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden , too , spoke of her last sad memory of Anastasia : `` Once , standing on some steps at the door of a house close by , I saw a hand and a pink-sleeved arm opening the topmost -LRB- highest -RRB- pane .
Anastasia 's family called Anastasia and her older sister Maria `` The Little Pair '' .
In 1981 , they had already been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs .
Several women have claimed to have been Anastasia . The most famous was Anna Anderson .
But in 1910 , Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva told other people in the family that Rasputin was allowed to see the four girls when they were wearing their nightgowns .
Tyutcheva said the children did not talk about Rasputin with her and kept his visits a secret .
Anastasia was 17 years and one month old when she was killed ; Maria was 19 years , one month old , and Alexei was just two weeks before his fourteenth birthday .
The earliest , made in 1928 , was called Clothes Make the Woman .
`` My dear , precious , only friend , '' wrote Anastasia .
The bodies of the Tsar , Tsarina , and three daughters were found in a grave near Yekaterinburg in 1991 ; however , the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and one of his sisters -LRB- either Anastasia or Maria -RRB- were not there .
Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated .
They had been killed by the Bolshevik secret police , commanded by Yurovsky .
Anastasia 's older sister , Maria , is said to have hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils .
Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise .
After the scandal , Nicholas asked Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time . Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine .
All the parents and children has his or her own special DNA .
In January 2008 , Russian scientists said that the remains of a young boy and woman found near Yekaterinburg in August 2007 might be the missing bodies .
Then , as the bodies were taken away , two of the grand duchesses moved .
They were buried with the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna .
They used metal detectors to find the bones .
Others in Perm later said that they saw Anastasia , her mother and sisters in Perm after they were killed , but this was only a rumor .
The remains of the Imperial Family were buried in 1998 . At that time , a body that measured about 5 feet , 7 inches -LRB- 170 cm -RRB- was buried as the body of Anastasia .
Her mother trusted Grigori Rasputin , a Russian peasant and wandering `` holy man '' .
The four girls sometimes signed letters with their nickname , OTMA .
The Tsar cried `` What ? ''
Anderson 's DNA matched with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska , a missing Polish factory worker .

''
Like many past years , the band participated in the Vans Warped Tour , although they only performed on the tour 's west coast swing from August 6 to August 17 .

The depression moved onto land at St. Catherines Island , Georgia , and it quickly weakened .
Other rainfall totals of 2 to 3 in -LRB- 50 to 75 mm -RRB- were common .
At Georgetown County , South Carolina , officials watched the storm closely .
Moving through an area of cool water temperatures , as well as unfavorable upper-level winds , the depression was not able to get winds greater than 35 mph -LRB- 55 km\/h -RRB- , and as a result did not gain tropical storm status .
At first , the depression moved west-northwest at about 13 mph -LRB- 20 km\/h -RRB- , and most of the convection from the storm was separated from the center .
The system was caught in an environment characterized by high surface pressures .
However , flood watches were issued for part of Georgia and South Carolina .
There were no damages or casualties because of this depression .
The storm continued to move northwestward for its whole life , from the steering currents of a subtropical ridge and an approaching mid-level trough .
Early on July 26 , it moved onto land on St. Catherines Island , Georgia , and after slowly weakening over land , it died out on July 27 .
However , the cloud pattern became organized , and was made up of a number of curved banding features .
The depression was never predicted to become tropical storm status . Because of this , no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued .
The depression formed on July 25 from the same tropical wave that created another weather system .
According to surface and satellite observations , it is thought that the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 1200 UTC on July 25 about 60 miles -LRB- 95 km -RRB- east of Daytona Beach , Florida .
Before landfall , the highest winds were measured to exist in a small area northeast of the center of circulation , where a well-defined group of clouds persisted .
It was a small and disorganized depression , and it never became a tropical storm , which is stronger than a tropical depression .
The depression dropped light to moderate rain from Florida to the coast of North Carolina . The highest rain was 5.17 inches -LRB- 131 mm -RRB- in Savannah , Georgia .
Because the storm was weak , the effects were limited to heavy rain in Florida , Georgia , South Carolina and North Carolina .
Tropical Depression Seven was a weak tropical depression that formed near the northeast Florida coast . It was the seventh tropical cyclone of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season .
A tropical wave , which had also created Tropical Depression Six , combined itself with an upper-level low pressure area to create an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23 , 2003 .

A tropical wave formed west from the African coast late on July 10 .
As Tropical Storm Franklin was forming , a tropical storm warning was issued for the northwest Bahamas , but it was canceled as Franklin moved north and away from the islands .
Meanwhile , Franklin began to accelerate to the northeast becoming an extratropical cyclone on July 30 to the south of Newfoundland .
The storm passed to 200 miles -LRB- 325 km -RRB- to the west of Bermuda on July 26 and moved slowly northwards into the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream .
Franklin moved unevenly to the east while weakening as shear increased again .
Later , Franklin became an extratropical cyclone near Newfoundland , before being absorbed by another non-tropical system .
The forecasters now said that Franklin could `` attain and maintain hurricane strength '' and make a close approach to Bermuda .
The extratropical storm passed close to the southern tip of Newfoundland later that day and was absorbed by a larger system on July 31 .
There were no damages or fatalities reported from Tropical Storm Franklin .
The NHC predicted that the storm would dissipate , but Frnaklin stopped weakening on July 25 with Franklin a minimal tropical storm .
Tropical Storm Franklin developed very close to land in the Bahamas and passed close to Bermuda , but there were no reports of tropical storm force winds overland , with the strongest gust recorded on Bermuda being 37 mph -LRB- 60 km\/h -RRB- .
After Franklin became an extratropical storm , it affected parts of southeastern Newfoundland , bringing about 1 inch -LRB- 25 mm -RRB- of rain to the area .
The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and strengthened into Tropical Depression Six while 70 miles -LRB- 110 km -RRB- east of Eleuthera .
The shear also reduced once again allowing Franklin to re-strengthen somewhat , with winds reaching 60 mph -LRB- 95 km\/h -RRB- on July 28 .
Tropical Storm Franklin suffered a lot of wind shear related with the development of Tropical Storm Gert , which made the forecasters at the National Hurricane Center to say that Franklin could be destroyed in the next few days .
Tropical Storm Franklin was a strong tropical storm that stayed in the western Atlantic Ocean for much of its life . Franklin was the sixth named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and almost became a hurricane two times .
Anyhow , soon after the depression formed , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin .
Several models showed the possibility of the storm to change westward and move into central Florida .
Initially the storm was predicted to move in a clockwise loop and slowly move to the west in response to a high pressure system .
However the shear stopped as Franklin moved to the northeast , allowing the storm to strengthen .
Shortly after on July 23 , Tropical Storm Franklin reached its strongest point with 70 mph -LRB- 110 km\/h -RRB- winds .
Tropical Storm Franklin formed north of the Bahamas on July 21 and moved steadily across the western Atlantic while coming close to Bermuda on July 26 .
A tropical storm watch was given out to Bermuda on July 25 but was also canceled a day later when Franklin moved away .

The Italians had armored vehicles -LRB- a small number of both L3\/35 light and M11\/39 medium tanks -RRB- , artillery , and , most important , superior air support .
The King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III and Mussolini agreed and at the beginning of August the campaign was ready to start .
On 5 August the port of Zeila was occupied after heavy fighting and every possibility of help from French Somaliland for the retreating British was cut .
The Italian central column , commanded by Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone faced more difficulties because of the mountainous terrain and was stopped by the English at the Karrin Pass , before Hargeisa .
Whilst the British made their fighting retreat to Berbera , the British Royal Navy had constructed an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials .
This campaign in Somaliland was like all the others of the Axis : it initially started with a victory , then after a period of time -LRB- like the campaigns in the Balkans , in the Philippines or in Russia -RRB- , finished with a complete defeat .
On 11 August , a new commander , Major-General Alfred Godwin-Austen , reached Tug Argan .
As a consequence , Mussolini ordered only some limited aggressive actions to capture territory along the borders of Kenya , Egypt and Sudan .
The Italians numbered about 24,000 .
But according to the British account of events total British casualties were 158 and Italian losses were estimated at between ten and twenty times higher .
The British launched two unsuccessful counterattacks but the next day were forced to abandon two other nearby hills .
The northern Italian column then proceeded south along the coast and occupied the village of Bulhar .
British Somaliland remained part of the Italian East Africa until March 1941 when the 1st\/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd\/15th Punjab Regiment returned from Aden to re-occupy the territory .
In the early hours of 3 August 1940 the Italian army crossed the border between Italian East Africa -LRB- called by the Italians Africa Orientale Italiana -RRB- and British Somaliland .
The Italian force attacking British Somaliland in August 1940 was commanded by General Guglielmo Nasi and included five colonial brigades , three Blackshirt battalions , and three bands -LRB- bande -RRB- of native troops .
The British colony was annexed by Mussolini to the Italian Empire in Italian East Africa .
In June 1940 Amedeo , Duke of Aosta , the Governor-General of Italian East Africa , convinced the Italian Supreme Command -LRB- Commando Supremo -RRB- to plan a campaign to conquer a British colony : British Somaliland .
The defensive positions of the British army were centered around six hills overlooking the only road toward Berbera .
The Italians were opposed by a British contingent of about 4,000 soldiers consisting of the Somaliland Camel Corps -LRB- commanded by Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater -RRB- , elements of the 2nd -LRB- Nyasaland -RRB- Battalion King 's African Rifles -LRB- KAR -RRB- and the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesian Regiment , the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment , and the 2nd Battalion , Black Watch .

Volkswagen itself created a concept car in 2000 called `` Dune '' and was meant to remind people of the Baja Bug .
This came to be known as a `` cut baja '' .
The first fiberglass body kit was introduced in 1969 by the Miller-Havens company .
More engine power was had by using cylinder heads and sometimes even fuel injection systems from VW Type 3 cars .
The car 's metal body parts were partially cut away to allow more ground clearance and suspension travel .
Basic changes are simple .
Shortened fiberglass fenders and sometimes more tubular steel parts are added to the car 's sides .
The rear change leaves the engine totally open to aid in cooling .
The Beetle was popular in places with few roads because of its rear-mounted air-cooled engine , flat floorpan , and torsion bar suspension .
The first racing Baja Bug is credited to automotive cartoonist Dave Deal , whose car was raced in the Mexican 1000 of 1968 .
Many are fitted with highly modified Volkswagen engines and a few have engines from such cars as the Ford Pinto , Chevrolet Corvair , Porsche , Mazda , Subaru or other four - to eight-cylinder water-cooled engines .
In fact , magazine advertising of the time said that the Beetle was so watertight it floated .
These good things made the Beetle the perfect choice to make into an off-road car . It was successful both then and now in the Baja 1000 off-road race .
The first Baja Bug may have been built by Gary Emory of Parts Obsolete in or around 1968 .
A Baja Bug is an original Volkswagen Beetle changed so that it can operate in open desert , sand dunes and beaches . Other kinds of air-cooled Volkswagens are sometimes changed this way .
Though few Baja Bugs are built anymore since the creation of tube-framed , purpose-built buggies known as sand rails and the shrinking supply of early Volkswagens , they remain a popular choice in the desert since few beaches in the US are open to for use by cars or motorcycles .
Some people even get rid of the torsion bar suspension and install coilover-type springs that mount to a roll cage .

Some astronomers have argued that Thule 's present orbit is the natural result of the force of Jupiter on a body orbiting at exactly the distance from the Sun Thule does , in the same way -LRB- though with the reverse effect -RRB- as the Kirkwood gaps in the more closer parts of the asteroid belt .
It was found by Johann Palisa on October 25 , 1888 in Vienna and was named aptly after the ultimate northern land of Thule .
It could thus be that the resonance which holds Thule in a very low-eccentricity orbit serves to eject other smaller bodies whose distance from the Sun is only a bit different from that of Thule itself .
It is the main member of the Thule dynamical group .
It appears to orbit in the farthest edge of the Main belt in a 3:4 orbital resonance with planet Jupiter .
Unlike the Hilda asteroids whose eccentricity is fairly common of main belt asteroids , Thule has a very low eccentricity - actually much lower than that of Jupiter itself and only a bit higher than that of Earth .
279 Thule is a very big Main belt asteroid .
The orbit of Thule is unusual .

Many of the classifications listed below are no longer used , and some did not survive until the designation `` Standard '' .
These letters -LRB- except for Y and Z -RRB- did not usually apply to the wide variety of passenger-rated but goods carrying vans -LRB- e.g. parcels vans , horse boxes , milk and fish vans -RRB- .
Their codes were an acronym of their traditional railway description , e.g. GUV for General Utility Vans .
Note that in modern usage , composite semi-open vehicles are classified Cso â `` the s signifying that the Standard portion is open -LRB- implying that the First portion is compartments with corridor -RRB- .
The London , Midland and Scottish Railway and the London and North Eastern Railway both developed a system of identifying carriages by means of alphabetic codes .
The letters used are :
The following list lists those codes that were actually used on British Railways , cross-referred to the comparable code used by the LMS , with the exception that the letter S -LRB- `` Second '' , later `` Standard '' -RRB- is used where until 1956 the letter T -LRB- `` Third '' -RRB- is used .
When British Railways was formed in 1948 , it decided to adopt the former LNER method of carriage classification .
The original Second was more or less abolished in the 1870s -LRB- as a result of the Railway Regulation Act 1844 -RRB- , remaining only in limited use for special services , such as those meeting ships -LRB- which retained the three-class system from which railway classifications had originated -RRB- .
In the 1980s , BR renamed Second to Standard .
The codes are made up from a combination of letters , some of which can indicate more than one word ; their meaning can only be determined according to their position , or the presence of other letters , in the code .
Suffix codes Y or Z are not shown , as these could apply to variants of any or all vehicle types .
In the original LNER coding system , S stood for `` Second '' , an intermediate class between First and Third -LRB- which later became Second -RRB- .

Deomyinae is the older and more appropriate name .
All genera are found in Africa , suggesting the deomyines may have originated there .
This subfamily is united solely on the basis of shared genetic mutations .

The main problem with metric time is in the units .
People have had ideas for other base units of metric time -LRB- other than the second -RRB- .
Unix time gives date and time as the number of seconds since January 1 , 1970 , and Microsoft 's FILETIME as multiples of 100ns since January 1 , 1601 .
On March 28 , 1794 , Joseph Louis Lagrange , the president of the commission which developed the metric system , wrote a report to the commission . His report suggested the names dÃ ci-jour and centi-jour -LRB- deciday and centiday in English -RRB- .
Metric time is a way of measuring how long a period of time is using the metric system . The metric system uses the second as a main unit of time .
James Clerk Maxwell and Elihu Thomson -LRB- through the British Association for the Advancement of Science - BAAS -RRB- came up with the Centimetre gram second system of units -LRB- cgs -RRB- in 1874 .
Other units of time , like the minute , hour , and day , are accepted for use with the modern metric system , but are not part of it .
These would be : 104 seconds -LRB- 10 000 seconds ; 166.6 minutes ; 2.777 hours -RRB- 105 seconds -LRB- 100 000 seconds ; 1 666.6 minutes ; 27.77 hours ; 1.157 days -RRB-
Followed by 109 -LRB- gigasecond = 1 000 000 000 seconds ; 16 666 666.666 minutes ; 277 777.777 hours ; 11 574.074 days ; 31.689 years -RRB- ; a relatively nonviable unit with which to measure human time\/life .
Base units that are decimal divisions of the day , such as 1\/10 , 1\/100 , 1\/1000 , or 1\/100 ,000 day , or other divisions of the day , such as 1\/20 or 1\/40 day , have also been suggested , with names such as tick , meck , chi , chron , moment , etc. .
They are named with metric prefixes . Some of these are kiloseconds and milliseconds .
To make this system of prefixes work for metric time , standard units and prefixes would have to be made for the 4th and 5th exponents to make metric time work for talking about time of human life .
Decimal time of day had been first used in France two years earlier , but was set aside at the same time the metric system was started , and did not follow the metric pattern of a base unit and prefixed units .
However , the fourth value in the SI Units is 106 -LRB- megasecond = 1 000 000 seconds ; 16 666.666 minutes ; 277.777 hours ; 11.574 days -RRB- .
The International System of Units has only come up with prefixes for 10 units exponentially in both the multiple and submultiple directions .
The metric system was first used in France in 1795 . It had units for length , area , dry volume , liquid capacity , weight or mass , and even amounts of money , but not for time .
The first three multiples would be viable for use within a metric time system ; they are 101 -LRB- decasecond = 10 seconds -RRB- , 102 -LRB- hectosecond = 100 seconds ; 1.666 minutes -RRB- and 103 -LRB- kilosecond = 1 000 seconds ; 16.666 minutes -RRB- respectively .
VAX\/VMS uses the number of 100ns since November 17 , 1858 and RISC OS the number of centiseconds since January 1 , 1900 .
The ephemeris second -LRB- 1\/86400 of a mean solar day -RRB- was made one of the original base units of the modern metric system , or International System of Units -LRB- SI -RRB- , at the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures -LRB- CGPM -RRB- in 1954 .

Nora began to weaken rapidly , and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later , while located between Blythe and Needles , California .
A remnant circulation aloft persisted , however , and was likely responsible for a period of near hurricane-force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City , Utah Doppler weather radar .
Farther inland , the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches for western Arizona , southeastern California , southwestern Colorado , southern Nevada and southern Utah on September 26 .
In other locations in Arizona , California , Nevada , and Utah , more than 3 i occurred in a few localized areas , sometimes with precipitation comparable to the entire local yearly average rainfall .

The 2001 â `` 2008 Bionicle story arc was set in a world inhabited predominantly by part-organic , part-machine beings -LRB- most notably the Matoran -RRB- in a subterranean world , which exists in massive domes underground .
His plan was to put the Matoran to sleep , wipe out their memories , and reawaken them `` as their conqueror . ''
Lego agreed to stop commercial use of the MÄ ori language after sending an executive to meet with MÄ ori representatives in New Zealand .
Music for the first three Bionicle films featured a more classical tune , rather that the techno-like beats used in the ads and animations .
Trapping the spirit of Mata Nui in the Mask of Life , he sent it flying into space so that the former Great Spirit can not interfere with his control over the universe .
Back in Metru Nui , Mata Nui 's awakening was celebrated , but celebration was cut short when it was revealed that Teridax had taken over the body of Mata Nui , revealed to be the universe of the Matoran .
They , as Matoran , were transformed into the Toa Metru by Toa stones containing power sacrificed by Toa Lhikan .
The Bionicle franchise has been well received , with one reviewer describing the sets as `` good combination of assembly and action figure '' and first-year sales of 100 million British pounds -LRB- 161.7 million USD -RRB- .
The Toa , now known as Toa Mahri , faced off against the Barraki to survive .
Combining their elemental powers , they were able to seal Teridax in a prison of crystallized protodermis .
The Rahkshi were stopped by the Toa , but not before killing Jaller .
Each toy packaging had special access codes that allows users to earn the points -LRB- `` the Bionicle equivalent of a loyalty scheme '' -RRB- that can be used to play web games .
The golden armor , scattered by Makuta 's blast is collected by Tahu , Gresh , and Takanuva from the many enemies .
They do return , however , the evil king Sidorak , and his viceroy Roodaka had been reigning in terror on the island , with vicious spider-like creatures called Visorak .
The concept of Bionicle was proposed in 2000 .
Their mission was to find the six Great Disks and defeat the Morbuzakh , a plant menace that threatened to destroy the city .
Bionicle was replaced by Hero Factory , which was released later in July 2010 .
In the last moments of his life , Toa Matoro used the Mask 's power to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and allow them to breathe air again .
To revert back to normal , the Toa sought out the legendary Rahi Keetongu .
The series made its first debut in virtual form on the web in December 2000 .
Mata Nui then mourns the brother that he could have had , in his mind .
Also , the war-like appearance of the Bionicle characters went against the company 's values : `` high-quality products , an emphasis on free play and encouraging the imagination , and no modern warfare or violence . ''
Teridax claims that he will destroy Bara Magna with gravitic energy , until Mata Nui forces his arm upwards , causing Teridax to send the energy wave to the moons above .
They discovered an inhabited village of Mahri Nui that had broken off from Voya Nui and sunk a thousand years ago .
However , the use of energy was too great and Takutanuva was crushed by the door , seeming to kill both Takanuva and Teridax , leaving only Takanuva 's Mask of Light .
Jaller , Hahli , Hewkii , Nuparu , Kongu , and Matoro escaped to the island in Toa canisters , but as they traveled , bolts of lighting from the Red Star transformed them into the Toa Inika .
Vakama then ordered the Visorak to be free .
Takanuva went to confront Makuta and , during their battle , they both fell into a pool of energized protodermis , a silvery substance with the power to change or destroy a being , and became fused together into the being Takutanuva .
Mata Nui then teams up with a few Glatorian to defeat the combined forces of the Skrall and Bone Hunters , two major threats to the villages , and look for a way to return to his body .
`` Bionicle '' is a portmanteau constructed from the words `` biological '' and `` chronicle '' .
They then proceeded to steal the Toa Nuva 's powers , which are the key to breaking the seal .
The villagers of this world are known as Agori .
According to Stephanie Lawrence , the global director of licensing for Lego , `` We 've created an evergreen franchise to complement the many event-based properties on the children 's market .
-LRB- 14 -RRB- A burst of energy from the Mask of Life transformed the Toa Inika into water-breathing forms .
The Toa were soon captured and mutated into bestial Toa Hordika .
Some MÄ ori terms used by Lego were changed , such as `` Huki '' , which was changed to `` Hewkii '' , and `` Tohunga '' , which was changed to `` Matoran '' .
Following the chase for the Mask of Life , the Toa Inika descended into the waters after receiving the mysterious clue `` save the sunken city '' from an unknown Matoran , who had saved Hahli from drowning at the cost of him dying from decompression sickness .
With the help of a small Matoran Resistance and the ancient guardian Axonn , the Toa Inika were able to free the Toa Nuva , find the temple of the mask , and battle the Piraka as well as the other creatures guarding it .
However , a number of MÄ ori terms such as `` Toa '' , which means `` warrior '' , `` Kanohi '' , which means `` face '' , and `` Kopaka '' , which means `` cold '' , were not changed .
He then remains dormant in the Ignika .
2009 began a whole new saga of the story-line , leaving behind the previous years , and venturing out to newer possibilities as Mata Nui , after having been banished by Makuta Teridax , crash lands on a mysterious barren planet , called Bara Magna .
The world of the Matoran began to fall apart .
Toa Vakama , however , betrayed the other Toa and joined Sidorak , who made him the leader of the Visorak .
The Kanohi Ignika had made a body for itself because it wished to see what it was like to be a living being .
In 1998 , the company suffered its first loss , resulting layoffs for the first time with 1000 people being laid off the following year .
The concept is similar to Lego Group 's earlier themes , Slizers\/Throwbots and RoboRiders in that each of those lines had characters based on classical elements .
He learns that he was created by the Great Beings on the planet of Spherus Magna , which is now divided into a jungle moon -LRB- Bota Magna -RRB- , an ocean moon -LRB- Aqua Magna -RRB- , and the remaining desert planet -LRB- Bara Magna -RRB- , as the result of the Core War .
With Cahdok and Gahdok defeated , the Bohrok Swarms are stopped and returned to their hives .
The mask landed on the planet of Bara Magna and the mask created a small body .
Takanuva , with the help of the remaining uncorrupted Av-Matoran , returned the Shadow Matoran to their previous states .
As of 2010 , the main Bionicle story will be published online .
The Toa struck her for this reason .
The Bionicle story is set in a science fantasy world and is primarily told through the book series , Bionicle Chronicles , Bionicle Adventures , and Bionicle Legends as well as through comic books published by DC Comics .
But mask of life that was stored inside Mata Nui was sent out to space to find a new planet .
Using some of his life energy , he revived Jaller while still holding the door open .
Bionicle had received a Toy of the Year Award for Most Innovative Toy in 2001 from the Toy Industry Association .
Jaller 's death caused Takua to realize he was the Toa of Light , and he donned the mask to become Toa Takanuva .
An increasing number of category manufacturers want to tap into the power of the BIONICLE universe , and the key for us now is to manage the excitement to stay true to the brand and the lifestyle of our core consumer . ''
With their combined forces , they reached a structure in the center of Karda Nui called the Codrex , where Toa Ignika had to sacrifice his new body to awaken Mata Nui .
The Rahkshi tore across Mata Nui , destroying the villages of Ta-Koro and Onu-Koro .
The Bionicle toyline drew to a close in late 2009 , after the 2010 sets were finalized for release , and was replaced in the summer of 2010 by Hero Factory , a Lego theme thatÂ s compatible with Bionicle sets .
The Agori together make up six different tribes , each affiliated with a region .
In this final journey , two heroes return to finish the fight : Tahu , returned to his original form to wear the powerful Golden Armor , and Takanuva .
The story begins with six Toa Mata : Tahu , Lewa , Gali , Kopaka , Pohatu , and Onua , arriving on an island known as the Island of Mata Nui , remembering nothing beyond their names .
After being equipped with new armor and weapons by Artakha , the Toa Nuva arrived at Karda Nui , the core of the universe .
Further down Bionicle 's history , more songs were used to help advertise their sets , most of which were produced by Danish band Cryoshell , as well as songs by other artists , like `` Crashed '' by Daughtry and `` Move Along '' by The All-American Rejects .
With the exception of a few wildlife species , Bara Magna is a barren desert planet which only supports few resources , so each tribe on the planet has a few warriors , called Glatorian , to battle for them .
When they sacrificed their power to awaken the Matoran , they become Turaga , and later established new villages on this island called Mata Nui .
One inventive Matoran of Earth , Nuparu , builds a powerful vehicle called the Boxor , made from parts of a damaged Bohrok in order to fight off the swarms .
They eventually emerged victorious with the Kanohi .
However , this had the side effect of freeing Makuta because Roodaka carried a fragment of his prison .
Afterwards , the Matoran prepared to return to the island city of Metru Nui .
Four films have also been made .
Initially , the idea of Bionicle was faced with resistance from `` company traditionalists '' as Lego had `` no experience of creating the kind of story-based , multichannel brand that was being proposed . ''
The Great Spirit 's life was saved but he still had to be awakened .
A few weeks earlier , in order to `` stabilise its financial situation , '' another 500 jobs were cut .
Within the fictional Bionicle universe , these changes were explained by the introduction of a `` Naming Day '' holiday , in which characters who have done heroic deeds for their village are honored by having the spelling of their name changed -LRB- though the pronunciation remains the same -RRB- .
This world -LRB- dubbed `` The Matoran Universe '' -RRB- and its races were once protected by a Great Spirit named Mata Nui , until he was cast into an eternal slumber by the evil Makuta Teridax and the Brotherhood of Makuta .
Earlier Bionicle packages had displayed the Technic Logo , but it has since been phased out , evolving Bionicle into its own branch of LEGO .
Paul Hardcastle and Simon Fuller produced the first soundtracks for Bionicle 's commercials used in 2001 to 2003 .
In 2005 , the first official Bionicle songs were released .
In response , a Lego spokesperson stated that only the term `` Bionicle '' had been trademarked .
To save him , they must travel to the island of Voya Nui and seek the mysterious Kanohi Ignika , the Mask of Life .
The Toa Nuva set out on this adventure but are quickly taken prisoner by six new and powerful enemies , the Piraka : Zaktann , Hakann , Vezok , Thok , Reidak , and Avak .
During that time , Lego was suffering a ten-year downturn .
They fight off the Skakdi Warlord , Nektann to defeat Makuta , and his army ; hordes of Rahkshi , armed with heat vision ; and Skrall .
The Bionicle story continues after Mata Nui was banished from his body by Makuta Teridax , onto a planet called Bara Magna .
Keetongu then killed Sidorak , whom Roodaka and Vakama betrayed .
Another strategy used to promote the website was the use of `` Kanoka points '' .
When they did , however , they were betrayed by Dume , the Turaga of the city .
2009 began a new saga of the story-line , leaving behind the previous years and venturing out to newer possibilities as Mata Nui , after having been banished by Makuta Teridax , finds his way to a mysterious barren planet called Bara Magna .
After the Mask of Life lands on Bara Magna , it creates a body for Mata Nui to use .
However , by the time the Toa retrieved the mask , the Great Spirit died .
The Toa , unaware of the Bohrok 's purpose , collected the Bohrok 's Krana -LRB- mask-like creatures that function as their brains -RRB- to confront the Bohrok Queens , the Bahrag : Cahdok and Gahdok .
There , they came to face the Makuta who were trying to turn the population of Av-Matoran â `` Matoran of Light â `` into Shadow Matoran .
Bionicle -LRB- stylized BIONICLE -RRB- is a line of toys by the LEGO Group marketed primarily for 5 - to 16-year-olds .
Here he becomes the center of the story and makes new allies as he tries to find a way to save the Matoran from Makuta Teridax 's tyrannical rule .
In 2004 , the sets accounted for approximately all of Lego 's turnover .
Mata Nui also learns that before he was built , there was a previous robot , which the Agori use as their home .
The main storyline is developed by a team of eight people around the world , who decide `` which media gets which bit of the story . ''
Here he becomes the center of the story , and makes new allies as he tries to find a way to save the Matoran and the Toa from Makuta Teridax 's tyrannical rule .
However , while production of sets will stop , the story will not , as Greg Farshtey will continue to update it on the website .
However , the Bionicle line soon became the `` biggest of the recent hits '' and the number one product of Lego in 2003 .
Tahu defeats Skakdi warlord Nektann , and then dons the armor , which incinerates every Rahkshi Kraata on Bara Magna .
Because the Bionicle story is told through multiple media -LRB- books , comics , and movies -RRB- , the purpose of the website is to put the different parts together .
The story continues as the forces of both the Matoran Universe and Glatorian face the oncoming onslaught of Skakdi , Rahkshi , and Skrall .
With the help of his new Glatorian and Agori friends he exposes a traitor known as Metus and defeats the Skrall and Bone Hunters .
But the Mask of Life possessed a will of its own , and in the last moment evades them all , rushing into the depths of the sea .
The practice of making every Bionicle product `` from toys to toothbrushes '' promote the website resulted in web traffic averaging more than a million page views per month in August 2004 .
After defeating the Skrall and seeing the rest of the villages unite , Mata Nui stands against the challenge of taking back his old body from Teridax .
In 2001 , several MÄ ori tribal groups from New Zealand threatened legal action against Lego for allegedly trademarking MÄ ori words used in naming the Bionicle product range .
After challenging the ferocious Manas crabs and the Shadow Toa -LRB- evil doppelganger-like illusional replicas of the Toa -RRB- , the Toa confront Makuta and defeat him by uniting their elemental powers .
They discovered that the inhabitants , the Matoran villagers , face constant attacks from infected Rahi , savage beasts controlled by the powerful influence of Makuta Teridax through use of Infected Kanohi masks , causing a war which lasted about 1000 years .
Bohrok are robotic drones that were designed to `` cleanse '' the island of Mata Nui to its state `` in the before-time '' .
The rapid success of Bionicle has had a major impact on the Lego company .
When the Glatorian and Toa discover the Ignika unscathed in the location where Mata Nui was , Mata Nui speaks to them from within the Mask of Life .
The line was launched on December 30 , 2000 in Europe and June\/July 2001 in Canada and the United States .
Shortly afterwards , the Toa escaped the core before the energy storm caused by Mata Nui 's awakening could destroy them .
The Toa traveled to a new island , which would later be known as Mata Nui , vowing to return to save the Matoran .
The Toa Nuva learned that Mata Nui was not only asleep but dying .
The defeated Cahdok and Gahdok are sealed in a prison created by the Toa 's elemental powers .
These resources , such as food and water , are distributed accordingly .
Upon his defeat , Makuta released the ancient Bohrok .
Shortly afterwards , two Matoran , Takua and Jaller , discovered the Kanohi Mask of Light .
They sought the mask for their own dark purposes .
Realizing there was still hope , Toa Matoro rushed to the core of the universe and sacrificed his life to revive Mata Nui .
However , six new elite Bohrok , called the Bohrok-Kal , appeared with the purpose of releasing the Bahrag .
The village was threatened by ancient warlords known as Barraki that had been mutated by the nearby mutagenic waters called `` The Pit '' .
As the Matoran prepared to journey to Metru Nui , the Turaga -LRB- village elders -RRB- revealed that they had once been Toa , fighting in Metru Nui against threats such as the Morbuzakh plant creature and the Dume-controlled Vahki enforcement squads .
Takutanuva then proceeded to open the door to the city of Metru Nui , allowing the Matoran and Toa through .
Since this controversy , Lego has not made any more names that are common terms in other living languages -LRB- with the exception of Umbra , a Latin word , and some names that are real names in some languages -RRB- .
After searching for and finding numerous Kanohi masks , the Toa each receive a Golden Kanohi mask with tremendous power and seek out Makuta himself .
Takanuva was promptly revived when his mask was used to activate the beacon to Metru Nui .
The Agori , Matoran , Toa , Glatorian and all others begin a new life on Spherus Magna .
They were tasked with traveling across the island of Mata Nui to find the Toa of Light .
The Makuta , however , failed to escape , and were all killed .
The strain causes his power core to dissipate , destroying the prototype robot .
They were produced by rock band All Insane Kids and are called `` Hero '' and `` Caught In A Dream '' -LRB- the latter being used as the theme of Bionicle 3 -RRB- .
The Toa fled , but were attacked by Teridax .
Meanwhile , Makuta created and sent out six creatures called Rahkshi to find the mask and stop the coming of the Toa of Light .
He helps the villages of the world to unite , taking all of the giant pieces of robot and linking them into a large prototype robotic body , a body like the one the Matoran Universe resides in .
The other Toa confronted the Visorak horde in a great battle , and convinced Vakama to rejoin them .
It has recently been announced by the director of LEGO that they will stop making new Bionicle sets after Winter 2010 `` for the foreseeable future '' .
He tells them that the future is their own and theirs to build .
On the verge of defeat , the Toa force all of their powers into the Bohrok-Kal , overloading and defeating them .
The six Toa then defeated Roodaka with all six of their elemental powers .
The finale concludes when Mata Nui uses his strength , and the power of the Mask of Life , to bring Spherus Magna together once more , to heal those who were mutated by Pit Mutagen , to bring life back to the planet , and to reconstruct destroyed geographical features .
As the sets were produced , Lego developed them on the sets ' website through `` character bios and an episodic adventure game . ''
Later , they discovered that Makuta Teridax had taken the disguise of Dume and taken control of the Vahki -LRB- law enforcement robots -RRB- .
The 2001 â `` 2008 storyline arc of Bionicle was set in a science fantasy world inhabited predominantly by part-organic , part-machine beings in a subterranean world , which exists in massive domes underground .
Upon their arrival , they learn of the Piraka and how they enslaved the local Matoran by posing as false Toa , in order to make the Matoran build them a fortress .
Having been restored by Keetongu , the Toa Metru brought the Matoran to a new island .
They are aided by Gresh .
The Toa Nuva were helped by the arrival of Takanuva , now able to control Light and Shadow because of a shadow leech attack , and Toa Ignika , who is the Mask of Life itself .
Mata Nui pushes Teridax back into one of the onrushing moons , the green moon of Bota Magna , whose impact destroys his core processor , which kills Teridax .
An Agori of Tesara named Tarduk helps Mata Nui by showing him an ancient power source that could power up the old robot .
But despite this , the story is continuing in serials written by Greg Farshtey online at BIONICLEstory.com .
The Toa Mata are then exposed to a substance called Energized Protodermis , which transforms them , granting them new armor and weapons .
In January 2004 , Lego posted a loss of 1.4 billion Danish kroner -LRB- 140 million British pounds and 223.86 million USD -RRB- .
They renamed themselves the `` Toa Nuva '' .
The Bohrok began to tear through the villages on the island , forcing Matoran to flee .
According to one source , Bionicle has changed the way children think of , and play with , LEGO products by combining `` the best of LEGO building with the story telling and adventure of an action figure line , '' and that 85 % of American boys age 6 â `` 12 know of the Bionicle brand and 45 % own the toys .
When the Toa failed to return , a group of six Matoran followed after them .

The rhythms which make Latin American dance popular were brought to Britain between the two World Wars .
Pierre was a professional dancer and dance teacher .
When he was there , he danced at the acadamias every night .
Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style .
The Latin and American section of the ISTD Ballroom Branch was formed in 1947 by Monsieur Pierre as Chairman .
`` Pierre had been a celebrated exponent and teacher of tango .
One of the characteristics of Cuban dance to the Son , and other similar rhythms , was , and still is , their method of taking three steps to four beats of music -LRB- whether 2\/4 or 4\/4 -RRB- .
In general , steps are kept compact and the dance is without any rise and fall .
Monsieur Pierre , or simply Pierre , was the professional name of Pierre Jean Phillipe Zurcher-Margolle , -LRB- born Toulon , France â `` London , 1963 -RRB- .
The argument in favor of this method was authenticity , and also satisfaction at the dance effect the Cuban style achieved .
Originally , Pierre had visited Paris to find out how their dancers and teachers dealt with the rumba .
`` The tango was always his speciality in demonstrations and as a result many teachers were attracted to it and first learned it from him '' .
By the 1930s Pierre had moved more towards the Latin American dances , and in 1934 his full-page trade adverts featured the rumba .
All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and , though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa , it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba .
After this he returned to London determined to teach the Cuban rumba , sistema cubano .
This work naturally included the Samba , Paso doble and Jive as well .
But after the war , in 1947 , Pierre visited Cuba , where he discovered to his surprise that the Cubans danced it differently .
Although he spent the rest of his life resident in London , Pierre never gave up his French citizenship .
The Cuban rumba figure starts on beat 2 , counting -LRB- pause -RRB- 2 , 3 , 4-1 as -LRB- pause -RRB- quick , quick , slow with the hip settling over the standing foot on 4-1 .
The syllabus finally agreed in 1955 has been the foundation of teaching and competition in the Latin American dances ever since .

John Locke -LRB- ; 29 August 1632 â `` 28 October 1704 -RRB- , known as the Father of Liberalism , was an English philosopher and physician .
In the Netherlands , Locke had time to return to his writing , spending a great deal of time re-working the Essay .
Locke did not return home until after the Glorious Revolution .
Locke 's father , who was also named John Locke , was a country lawyer . He had served as a captain in the early part of the English Civil War .
Locke used the advice of several physicians and persuaded Shaftesbury to go to an operation .
During this period he discussed matters with such figures as John Dryden and Isaac Newton .
Locke 's close friend Lady Masham invited him to join her at the Mashams ' country house in Essex .
At this time , due to Shaftesbury 's insists , Locke wrote the Two Treatises of Government .
Locke had been looking for a job and in 1667 moved into Shaftesbury 's home at Exeter House in London , to serve as Lord Ashley 's personal physician .
In 1647 , Locke was sent to Westminster School in London . During this time he was being sponsored by Alexander Popham , a member of the Parliament .
Locke 's medical knowledge was put to the test when Shaftesbury 's liver disease became worse until Shaftesbury was about to die .
However , Locke ran away to the Netherlands in 1683 . This is because people became suspicious of him being involved in the Rye House Plot .
Locke was awarded a bachelor 's degree in 1656 and a master 's degree in 1658 .
Locke was born on 29 August 1632 , in a cottage by the church in Wrington , Somerset , about twelve miles from Bristol .
Both mother and father were Puritans .
Locke never married nor had children .
However , after Shaftesbury began to fall from favor in 1675 , Locke decided to travel across France .
In 1666 , he met Lord Anthony Ashley Cooper , who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for his liver disease .
Shaftesbury , as a member of the Whig movement , was a big influence on Locke 's political ideas .
He did not quite see the Act of Union of 1707 , though the thrones of England and Scotland were held in personal union throughout his lifetime .
While it was once thought that Locke wrote the Treatises to defend the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed before this even started .
Constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy were in their infancy during Locke 's time .
His mother , Agnes Keene , was a tanner 's daughter and was thought to be very beautiful .
Although his time there was marked by variable health from asthma attacks , he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs .
He was baptized when he was born .
His writings influenced Voltaire and Rousseau , a lot of Scottish Enlightenment thinkers , as well as the American revolutionaries .
Cooper was impressed with Locke and asked him to come .
Events that happened during Locke 's lifetime include the English Restoration , the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London .
Locke came with William of Orange 's wife back to England in 1688 .
He died in 28 October 1704 , and is buried in the churchyard of the village of High Laver , east of Harlow in Essex , where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691 .

The region has a very low population density .
The Caledonian Canal , which extends from Loch Linnhe in the west , via Loch Ness to the Moray Firth in the north splits this area from the rest of the country .
Mountains may have up to 6 months of snow . Naturally the area would be a vast birch , pine and montane shrub forest , such as those surviving in Glen Affric .
Considering its terrain and its latitude of about 57 to 58 degrees North , the area is surprisingly warm : this is due to the mild influence of the Gulf Stream .
This area 's climate varies with altitude . It has wet , warm summers , average under 17C -LRB- 62.6 F -RRB- .
Significant settlements are Kyle of Lochalsh , Mallaig , Dingwall , Dornoch , and Ullapool .
The Northwest Highlands are the northern third of Scotland that is separated from the Grampian Mountains by the Great Glen .
It is the administrative center for the Highland Council area .
Bordering the region to the north east is the lowland area of Caithness .

In order to move within the quicksand , a person or object must apply sufficient pressure on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to liquefy it .
Quicksand may be found inland -LRB- on riverbanks , near lakes , or in marshes -RRB- , or near the coast .
Quicksand is a non-Newtonian fluid : when undisturbed it often appears to be solid -LRB- `` gel '' form -RRB- , but a minor -LRB- less than 1 % -RRB- change in the stress on the quicksand will cause a sudden decrease in its viscosity -LRB- `` sol '' form -RRB- .
Water circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as clay .
Quicksand is a non-Newtonian fluid : when undisturbed it often appears to be solid -LRB- `` gel '' form -RRB- , but a minor -LRB- less than 1 % -RRB- change in the stress on the quicksand will cause a sudden decrease in its viscosity -LRB- `` sol '' form -RRB- . After an first disturbance -- such as a person attempting to walk on it -- the water and sand in the quicksand separate and dense regions of sand sediment form ; it is because of the formation of these high volume fraction regions that the viscosity of the quicksand seems to increase suddenly .
Since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand , the sand above does not appear to move at all , and can support leaves and other small debris . This makes it difficul to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment .
The forces required to do this are quite large : to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of one centimeter per second would require the same amount of force as `` that needed to lift a medium-sized car . ''
This lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight , since they move around with very little friction .
The water moves up and then down slowly in a convection-like manner throughout a column of sand under optimal conditions , and the sand remains a generally solid mass. .
Someone stepping in it will start to sink .

The attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced -LRB- extracted -RRB- , or even better , the key .
On the other hand poor cipher depends on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subjected to extensive testing and inspection ; for this reason many computer-age encryption systems are still subject to ciphertext-only attack but still in use .
The ability to obtain any amount of information from the underlying ciphertext is considered a success .
Every modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks .
In cryptography , a ciphertext-only attack -LRB- COA -RRB- or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of ciphertexts .
Examples include :
The process of Selecting a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical different approach from random noise .

In Method of Fluxions -LRB- written 1671 , published 1736 -RRB- , Sir Isaac Newton examined the transformations between polar coordinates , which he referred to as the `` Seventh Manner ; For Spirals '' , and nine other coordinate systems .
Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral .
In the journal Acta Eruditorum -LRB- 1691 -RRB- , Jacob Bernoulli used a system with a point on a line , called the pole and polar axis respectively .
The concepts of angle and radius were already used by ancient peoples of the 1st millennium BCE .
Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647 , while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653 .
The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge 's Origin of Polar Coordinates .
Bernoulli 's work extended to finding the radius of curvature of curves expressed in these coordinates .
The astronomer Hipparchus -LRB- 190-120 BCE -RRB- created a table of chord functions giving the length of the chord for each angle , and there are references to his using polar coordinates in establishing stellar positions .
As the coordinate system is two-dimensional , each point is determined by two polar coordinates : the radial coordinate and the angular coordinate .
Alexis Clairaut was the first to think of polar coordinates in three dimensions , and Leonhard Euler was the first to actually develop them .
In mathematics , the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by an angle and a distance .
Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs .
There are various accounts of the introduction of polar coordinates as part of a formal coordinate system .
The actual term polar coordinates has been attributed to Gregorio Fontana and was used by 18th-century Italian writers .
GrÃ goire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century .
The Greek work , however , did not extend to a full coordinate system .
In On Spirals , Archimedes describes the Archimedean spiral , a function whose radius depends on the angle .
Coordinates were specified by the distance from the pole and the angle from the polar axis .

Iraq and Iran entered into warfare on September 22 , 1980 .
Under pressure from the Shah , who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975 , Saddam agreed to kick Khomeini out in 1978 .
He was then left completely in control of Iraq . The country never recovered from the Gulf War , economically or with the army .
By the beginning of April Coalition forces had much of Iraq .
175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and the dead were estimated to be 85,000 .
U.S. officials attempted to maintain a conciliatory line with Iraq , indicating that while Bush and Baker did not want force to be used , they would not take any position on the Iraqi-Kuwait dispute and did not want to become involved .
The UN placed a trade embargo on Iraq , blocking Iraqi oil exports .
After making some gains , Iraq 's troops began to suffer losses from human-wave attacks by Iran .
They returned to Iraq when they received assurances that Saddam Hussein would pardon them .
The U.S. helped Saddam Hussein in the war with Iran , but with Iraq 's take over of the oil-rich emirate of Kuwait in August of 1990 the United States led a United Nations attempt that drove Saddam from Kuwait in February 1991 .
The Reagan administration gave Saddam roughly $ 40 billion worth of arms in the 1980s to fight Iran , nearly all of it on credit .
As Iraq-Kuwait relations rapidly grew worse , Saddam was getting conflicting information about how the U.S. would respond to an invasion .
He soon became the creator of Iraq 's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations .
In 1976 Saddam was appointed as a general in the Iraqi army .
The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew in the region , particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations , especially Iraq .
Saddam 's proposal further split the Arab world , pitting U.S. - and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians .
Saddam then sent his troops into Kuwait .
Saddam had pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices and cut back production , but on top of Kuwaiti refusals to do so , Kuwait helped spearhead OPEC 's opposition to the production cuts that Saddam had requested .
Saddam returned to Iraq , but was imprisoned in 1964 when an anti-Ba ` ath group led by Abdul Rahman Arif took power .
The U.S. ambassador to Iraq , April Glaspie , met with Saddam in a meeting on July 25 , where the Iraqi leader said he wanted to keep talks going .
Helped by the Security Council , a U.S.-led coalition launched missile attacks on Iraq , January 16 , 1991 .
Together , Iraq and Kuwait had 20 percent of the world 's known oil reserves .
According to Saddam , in 1957 , at the age of 20 , Saddam became part of the Ba ` ath Party .
The Iraqi government and military collapsed in three weeks of the beginning of the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq on March 20 .
Washington had been taking measures to start a good relationship with Iraq for roughly a decade .
As the war was looming on February 24 , 2003 , Saddam Hussein talked with CBS News anchor Dan Rather for more than three hoursâ '' his first interview with a U.S. reporter in over a decade .
In August 1995 , Rana and her husband Hussein Kamel al Majid and Raghad and her husband , Saddam Kamel Majid , defected to Jordan , taking their children with them .
This caused hardship in Iraq and almost destroyed the Iraqi economy and state infrastructure .
Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil , and keeping prices low , when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt .
Khomeini , having been exiled from Iran in 1964 , began living in Iraq , at the Shi'ite holy city of An Najaf .
U.S. officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the terms of the Gulf War 's cease fire , by developing weapons of mass destruction and other banned weaponry , and violating the UN-imposed sanctions and `` no fly zones . ''
Saddam ignored the Security Council deadline .
The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to guerrilla tactics , and it appeared that Saddam had lost control of Iraq .
On December 9 , 1996 the United Nations allowed Baghdad to begin selling limited amounts of oil for food and medicine .
There , he became involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ite s and got a strong religious and political following throughout the world .
As part of the cease-fire agreement , Iraq agreed to get rid of all poison gas and germ weapons and allow UN observers to inspect the sites .
In 1979 Iran 's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution , giving way to an Islamic republic led by the Ayatollah Khomeini .
He never knew his father , Hussein ` Abd al-Majid , who disappeared five months before Saddam was born .
There had also been a rivalry between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s .
In August 2 , 1990 , Saddam invaded and Kuwait , thus making an international crisis .
Army officers , including some with the Ba ` ath party , came to power in Iraq in a military coup in 1963 .
Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti -LRB- April 28 1937 - December 30 2006 -RRB- , was the President of Iraq , from July 16 1979 to April 9 2003 , when he was removed from his position during the War in Iraq led by the United States .
After Khomeini gained power , small battles between Iraq and revolutionary Iran happened for ten months . They were fought over who controlled the the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway , which divides the two countries .
Later , Iraq and Kuwait then met for a final negotiation session , which failed .
Domestic repression inside Iraq grew worse , and Saddam 's sons , Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein , became increasingly powerful and carried out a private reign of terror .
The U.S. also sent billions of dollars of food and arms to Saddam to keep him from forming a strong alliance with the Soviets .
The invasion of Kuwait gave Iraq , with its own substantial oil fields , control of 20 percent of the Persian Gulf oil .
But Saddam had focused attention on the Palestinian problem by promising to make his forces leave from Kuwait if Israel would leave the occupied territories in the West Bank , the Golan Heights , and the Gaza Strip .
Only smuggling across the Syrian border , and humanitarian aid kept Iraq from crisis .
He was last seen in a video which showed him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters .
The United States did not help the rebellions , although they had wanted Iraqis to rise up against Saddam .
In the first days of the war , there was heavy ground fighting around major ports as Iraq launched an attack on Iran 's oil-rich , Arab-populated province of Khuzestan .
He escaped from jail in 1967 and became one of the leading members of the party .

Mice are currently the most closely related laboratory animal species to humans for which the knockout technique can easily be applied .
Aspects of the technology for generating knockout mice , and the mice themselves have been patented in many countries by private companies .
A knockout mouse is a genetically engineered mouse in which one or more genes have been turned off by a gene knockout .
Gene knockout in rats is much harder and has only been possible since 2003 .
They are widely used in knockout experiments , especially those genetic questions which relate to human physiology .
By causing a specific gene to be inactive in the mouse , and observing any differences from normal behavior or condition , researchers can infer its probable function .
A detailed explanation of how knockout -LRB- KO -RRB- mice are produced is at the website of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2007 .
Knockout mice are important animal models for studying the role of genes which have been sequenced but whose functions are not yet known .

Superscalar CPU design is concerned with improving accuracy of the instruction dispatcher , and allowing it to keep the multiple functional units in use at all times .
While most superscalar CPUs are also pipelined , it possible to have a non-pipelined superscalar CPU or a pipelined non-superscalar CPU .
A superscalar CPU architecture implements a form of parallel computing called Instruction-level parallelism inside a single processor which allows faster CPU throughput at the same clock rate .
While hardware advances will allow greater numbers of functional units -LRB- e. g , ALUs -RRB- , the problem of checking instruction dependencies increases to a limit that the achievable superscalar dispatching limit is somewhat small .
Some multicore processors also include vector capability .
As of 2008 all general-purpose CPUs are superscalar , a typical superscalar CPU may include up to 4 ALUs , 2 FPUs , and two SIMD units .
Each instruction executed by a Scalar processors manipulates one or two data items at a time , while each instruction executed by a Vector processor operates simultaneously on many data items .
In a superscalar CPU an instruction dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel , dispatching them on the multiple redundant functional units available inside the CPU .
However even given infinitely fast dependency checking logic inside a conventional superscalar CPU , if the instruction stream itself has many dependencies , this would also limit the possible speedup .
A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two :
Each functional unit is not a separate CPU core but an execution resource inside the CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit , floating point unit -LRB- FPU -RRB- , a bit shifter , or a multiplier .
The various alternative techniques are not mutually exclusiveâ '' they can be -LRB- and frequently are -RRB- combined in a single processor .
A superscalar processor executes more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions -LRB- termed instruction dispatching -RRB- to multiple redundant functional units built inside the processor .
Thus the degree of intrinsic parallelism in the code stream forms another limitation .
-- Likely on the order of five to six simultaneously dispatched instructions .
Thus it is possible to design a multicore CPU is where each core is an independent processor containing multiple parallel superscalar pipelines .
No matter how fast the dispatcher speed , there is a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched .

The pitcher 's mound was not moved back to its present position of 60 feet , six inches until Young 's fourth season . He did not wear a glove until his sixth .
Experience , to my mind , teaches to the contrary .
Cy Young 's career is seen as a bridge from baseball 's earliest days to its modern era .

Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time .
On September 18 , 1897 , Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds .
`` I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it , '' said Young , `` and there was n't any use wasting them . ''

However , two weeks later , Young 's 906th and final game ended badly : the last eight batters of Young 's career combined to hit a triple , four singles and three doubles .
In addition to wins , Young holds the MLB records for most career innings pitched -LRB- 7,355 -RRB- , most career games started -LRB- 815 -RRB- , and most complete games -LRB- 749 -RRB- .
However , Johnson broke Young 's career record for strikeouts .
I aimed to make the batter hit the ball , and I threw as few pitches as possible .
Young retired after the 1911 season with 511 career wins .
Young stayed with the Boston team until 1909 .
His win total set the record for most career wins by a pitcher .
Particularly after his fastball slowed , Young 's success relied upon his great control .
On September 22 , 1911 , Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates and their pitcher Babe Adams 1-0 , for his last career win .
I 'd loosen up , three , four minutes .
At the time , Pud Galvin had the second most career wins with 364 .

Similar to viruses , plasmids are not considered a form of `` life '' as it is currently defined .
The term plasmid was first introduced by the American molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg in 1952 .
A plasmid is a DNA molecule that is separate from , and can replicate independently of , the chromosomal DNA .
Plasmids can be found in all three major domains , Archaea , Bacteria and Eukarya .
Unlike viruses , plasmids are `` naked '' DNA and do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host .
Microbial transformation with plasmid DNA is neither parasitic nor symbiotic in nature , since each implies the presence of an independent species living in a commensal or detrimental state with the host organism .
Rather , plasmids provide a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and may provide a selective advantage under a given environmental state .
Plasmid size varies from 1 to over 1,000 kilobase pairs -LRB- kbp -RRB- .
Plasmids are often associated with conjugation , a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer .
Plasmids usually occur naturally in bacteria , but are sometimes found in eukaryotic organisms -LRB- e.g. , the 2-micrometre-ring in Saccharomyces cerevisiae -RRB- .
The number of identical plasmids within a single cell can range from one to thousands .
Plasmids may carry genes that provide resistance to naturally occurring antibiotics in a competitive environmental niche , or alternatively the proteins produced may act as toxins under similar circumstances .
Plasmids are considered transferable genetic elements , or `` replicons '' , capable of autonomous replication within a suitable host .
Plasmids also can provide bacteria with an ability to fix elemental nitrogen or to degrade difficult organic compounds .

In the 20th century , literary scholar Kermit Vanderbilt noted , `` Increasingly rare is the scholar who braves ridicule to justify the art of Longfellow 's popular rhymings . ''

Over the years , Longfellow 's personality has become part of his reputation .
In Madrid , he spent time with Washington Irving and was particularly impressed by the author 's work ethic .
His accusations may have been a publicity stunt to boost readership of the Broadway Journal , for which he was the editor at the time .
In the last two decades of his life , he often received requests for autographs from strangers , which he always sent .

On August 22 , 1879 , a female admirer traveled to Longfellow 's house in Cambridge and , unaware to whom she was speaking , asked Longfellow : `` Is this the house where Longfellow was born ? ''
However , as Longfellow himself wrote , the poems were `` so mild that even a Slaveholder might read them without losing his appetite for breakfast '' .

Even so , Longfellow , like many during this period , called for the development of high quality American literature .
He had become one of the first American celebrities and was also popular in Europe .
Longfellow often used didacticism in his poetry , though he focused on it less in his later years .
A critic for The Dial agreed , calling it `` the thinnest of all Mr. Longfellow 's thin books ; spirited and polished like its forerunners ; but the topic would warrant a deeper tone '' .
Shortly thereafter in 1854 , Longfellow retired from Harvard , devoting himself entirely to writing .

Longfellow was born on February 27 , 1807 , to Stephen Longfellow and Zilpah -LRB- Wadsworth -RRB- Longfellow in Portland , Maine , then a district of Massachusetts , and he grew up in what is now known as the Wadsworth-Longfellow House .

As James Russell Lowell said , Longfellow had an `` absolute sweetness , simplicity , and modesty '' .
Devastated by her death , he never fully recovered and occasionally resorted to laudanum and ether to deal with it .
Longfellow would live there for the remainder of his life .
In fact , Longfellow rarely wrote on current subjects and seemed detached from contemporary American concerns .
Many of his works helped shape the American character and its legacy , particularly with the poem `` Paul Revere 's Ride '' .
He stayed at the Portland Academy until the age of fourteen .
Shortly after the book 's publication , Longfellow attempted to join the literary circle in New York and asked George Pope Morris for an editorial role at one of Morris 's publications .
A more modern critic said , `` Who , except wretched schoolchildren , now reads Longfellow ? ''

He traveled to France , Spain , Italy , Germany , back to France , then England before returning to the United States in mid-August 1829 .
`` Not yet '' , he replied .
He suffered from neuralgia , which caused him constant pain , and he also had poor eyesight .
Longfellow , awakened from his nap , rushed to help her and threw a rug over her , though it was too small .
He endured the pain for several days with the help of opium before he died surrounded by family on Friday , March 24 , 1882 .
`` Resignation '' , written as a response to the death of his daughter Fanny in 1848 , does not use first-person pronouns and is instead a generalized poem of mourning .
During the courtship , Longfellow frequently walked from Cambridge to the Appleton home in Beacon Hill in Boston by crossing the Boston Bridge .
Three years later , he was inspired to write the poem `` Footsteps of Angels '' about her .
He and Fanny had six children : Charles Appleton -LRB- 1844 â `` 1893 -RRB- , Ernest Wadsworth -LRB- 1845 â `` 1921 -RRB- , Fanny -LRB- 1847 â `` 1848 -RRB- , Alice Mary -LRB- 1850 â `` 1928 -RRB- , Edith -LRB- 1853 â `` 1915 -RRB- , and Anne Allegra -LRB- 1855 â `` 1934 -RRB- .
He printed his first poem â '' a patriotic and historical four stanza poem called `` The Battle of Lovell 's Pond '' â '' in the Portland Gazette on November 17 , 1820 .
His assessment was that Longfellow was `` a determined imitator and a dextrous adapter of the ideas of other people '' , specifically Alfred , Lord Tennyson .
Longfellow spent several years translating Dante Alighieri 's Divine Comedy .
At first , she was not interested but Longfellow was determined .
The Southern Literary Messenger immediately put Longfellow `` among the first of our American poets '' .
He pursued his literary goals by submitting poetry and prose to various newspapers and magazines , partly due to encouragement from a professor named Thomas Cogswell Upham .
Longfellow was surprised to hear that it had been saved , unusual for a printing office , and asked to borrow it so that he could revise it , forgetting to return it to Griswold .
Between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825 , he had published nearly 40 minor poems .
The couple settled in Brunswick , though the two were not happy there .
In honor of Longfellow 's role with translations , Harvard established the Longfellow Institute in 1994 , dedicated to literature written in the United States in languages other than English .
When Longfellow graduated from Bowdoin , he was ranked fourth in the class , and had been elected to Phi Beta Kappa .
Longfellow was the most popular poet of his day and is generally regarded as the most distinguished poet the country had produced .
His first major poetry collections were Voices of the Night -LRB- 1839 -RRB- and Ballads and Other Poems -LRB- 1841 -RRB- .
It was reported that 10,000 copies of The Courtship of Miles Standish sold in London in a single day .
The story , possibly apocryphal , is that an influential trustee , Benjamin Orr , had been so impressed by Longfellow 's translation of Horace that he was hired under the condition that he travel to Europe to study French , Spanish , and Italian .
Many of the metaphors he used in his poetry as well as subject matter came from legends , mythology , and literature .
Longfellow , despite his aversion to public speaking , accepted an offer from Joshua Chamberlain to speak at his fiftieth reunion at Bowdoin College ; he read the poem `` Morituri Salutamus '' so quietly that few could hear him .
Longfellow had her body embalmed immediately and placed into a lead coffin inside an oak coffin which was then shipped to Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston .
In October 1835 , during the trip , his wife Mary had a miscarriage about six months into her pregnancy .
The home , built in 1759 , had once been the headquarters of George Washington during the Siege of Boston beginning in July 1775 .
John Greenleaf Whittier suggested it was this massive correspondence that led to Longfellow 's death , writing : `` My friend Longfellow was driven to death by these incessant demands '' .
Lewis Mumford said that Longfellow could be completely removed from the history of literature without much effect .
The visitor then asked if he had died here .
After being printed in Graham 's Magazine , its editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold saved the manuscript from the trash .
In December 1834 , Longfellow received a letter from Josiah Quincy III , president of Harvard College , offering him the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages position with the stipulation that he spend a year or so abroad .
His last few years were spent translating the poetry of Michelangelo ; though Longfellow never considered it complete enough to be published during his lifetime , a posthumous edition was collected in 1883 .
During his courtship , Longfellow continued writing and , in late 1839 , published Hyperion , a book in prose inspired by his trips abroad and his unsuccessful courtship of Fanny Appleton .
I say she shall !
A London critic in the London Quarterly Review , however , condemned all American poetry , saying , `` with two or three exceptions , there is not a poet of mark in the whole union '' but singled out Longfellow as one of those exceptions .
About 24 of them appeared in the short-lived Boston periodical The United States Literary Gazette .
There , he further studied German as well as Dutch , Danish , Swedish , Finnish , and Icelandic .
A small collection , Poems on Slavery , was published in 1842 as Longfellow 's first public support of abolitionism .
`` Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds '' is a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney for the Beatles ' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
A 3.2 million year-old , 40 % complete fossil skeleton of an Australopithecus afarensis specimen discovered in 1974 was named `` Lucy '' because the Beatles song was being played loudly and repeatedly on a tape recorder in the camp .
There are few other songs that so successfully evoke a dream world , in both the sonic textures and words . ''
`` I was so nervous I could n't sing , '' he told the journalist Ray Connolly , `` but I like the lyrics . ''
The White dwarf star BPM 37093 , which contains a core of crystallized carbon roughly 4000 km in diameter , is informally named `` Lucy '' as a tribute to the Beatles song .
According to the Beatles , Lennon 's son , Julian Lennon showed his father a nursery school drawing he called Lucy - in the sky with diamonds , depicting his classmate , Lucy O'Donnell .
Julian said , `` I do n't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings , but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age .
In a review for the BBC , Chris Jones described the song as `` nursery rhyme surrealism '' that contributed to Sgt. Pepper 's `` revolutionary ... sonic carpet that enveloped the ears and sent the listener spinning into other realms . ''
Rolling Stone magazine described the song as `` Lennon 's lavish daydream '' and music critic Richie Unterberger said '' ` Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds ' was one of the best songs on the Beatles ' famous Sgt. Pepper album , and one of the classic songs of psychedelia as a whole .
I used to show dad everything I 'd built or painted at school , and this one sparked off the idea ... '' Lucy Vodden nÃ e O'Donnell died of an immune system disease in 2009 .
In later interviews , Lennon expressed disappointment with the Beatles ' arrangement of the recording , complaining that inadequate time was taken to fully develop his initial idea for the song .
Lennon 's son , Julian , inspired the song with a nursery school drawing he called `` Lucy â '' in the sky with diamonds '' .
Shortly after the song 's release , people realized that the first letter of each of the title 's nouns spelled LSD .
Though Lennon denied and mocked the idea of a hidden LSD reference , the BBC banned the song .

Regardless of the aridity of the greater Sahara , migration along the river corridor was halted when , during a desert phase 1.8-0 .8 million years ago , the Nile ceased to flow completely and possibly flowed only temporarily in other periods due to Nubian Swell uplift .
Flora and fauna previously widespread retreat northwards to the Atlas Mountains , southwards into West Africa , or eastwards into the Nile Valley and thence either south-east to the Ethiopian Highlands and Kenya or north-east across the Sinai into Asia .
During the periods of a wet Sahara , the Sahara and Arabia become a savanna grassland and African flora and fauna become common .
This separates populations of some of the species in areas with different climates , forcing them to adapt , possibly giving rise to speciation -LRB- species splitting -RRB- .
Evaporation exceeds precipitation , the level of water in lakes like Lake Chad falls , and rivers become dry wadis .
During the following dry period , the Sahara reverts to desert conditions usually as a result of the retreat of the West African Monsoon southwards .

The Battle of Honey Springs was an American Civil War battle . It was an important victory for Union forces in their efforts to gain control of the Indian Territory .
The battle was also unique in the fact that white soldiers were the minority in both forces .
The police needed to recruit and with considerable success he set about making service more attractive .
The marriage fell apart quickly and they separated .
Young 's lobby of the 1960 Royal Commission on the Police overcame Home Office objections to a strengthened police inspectorate , although Sir Charles Cunningham blocked Young 's selection as inaugural first Chief Inspector of Constabulary .
He was also Honorary Police Commissioner of New York City .
Police housing was one of the outstanding issues of the time .
At the same time he got more involved in the many royal visits to Portsmouth . When Haile Selassie visited the dockyard in September 1937 , he acted as his personal escort and French interpreter .
The Commissioner , Sir Harold Scott , tolerated him -LRB- although he was an outsider too -RRB- , but senior colleagues cold-shouldered him .
Just after the center was opened and its first students through their course , Young was made a Colonel and moved from the classroom in July 1943 to be Senior British Police Officer in the Mediterranean Theatre , stationed in North Africa awaiting the invasion of Sicily .
Young wanted to head his own force and tried to become chief constable of the Isle of Wight Constabulary , before he became Acting Chief Constable of Leamington Spa Borough Police in September 1938 , aged 31 , at a salary of Â # 500 per annum .
Still aged only 38 , he had twenty-one years of experience of small , medium and large city and borough forces .
To bring in an outsider to such a rank in the Met was unprecedented .
Uniforms were made more comfortable and practical .
He sternly opposed Lord Trenchard 's officer-class way of thinking as wholly inappropriate for the British police service .
Although later in life Young would drift away from regular worship , the impact of Portsmouth on his world-view never shifted .
The Home Office allowed Hertfordshire to be the first force after the war to introduce a wireless system - Young adapted from his Birmingham model for rural use .
Young 's career made him the most decorated policeman of his era .
Young married three times .
Learning by example and by demonstration is common now , but in 1941 it was a new idea and it caught the approving eye of the Home Office .
He was knighted in 1965 and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire -LRB- KBE -RRB- in 1971 .
Young went ashore on day two of the invasion , and became Director of Public Safety in the first functioning Allied military government - the Allied Control Commission for Italy ; in December 1943 he was given the additional role of Director of Security , responsible directly to the Commander-in-Chief for hunting saboteurs and enemy agents as well as the removal of fascist officials from public offices .
Improved pay and conditions and professional standards remained his constant pre-occupations .
Made a Constable in May 1925 , he became the Coroner 's Officer in April 1932 .
Young became Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary in 1944 -LRB- but released from the army only in April 1945 -RRB- . He was in charge of 515 officers at a salary of Â # 1,290 .
Hertfordshire showed that Young wanted to be a chief police officer who made things happen .
He headed the enquiries into the UK 's first case of manslaughter arising from the use of an aeroplane .
In 1946 , he wrote : `` I hold the view that the police organization is not a police force but a police service , which offers to the right individual not merely a job but all the advantages of a professional career .
She committed suicide in Malta in 1966 .
He resisted the well-ingrained tradition of bringing senior officers from the armed forces into police commands ; and only with great reluctance did he give in to the demand from the Hertfordshire police committee that he use his wartime military rank .
He went to school in Southsea from 1912 to 1915 and then Portsmouth Grammar School from 1915 to 1924 . He was not very good at school , but liked the Officers ' Training Corps ; later he returned to present prizes and told the pupils that his parents would have been very surprised to see him in the hall on speech day because he had never come close to winning any school award .
He was a governor of the Police College and of Atlantic College , and a member of the committees of the Police Advisory Board , the National Police Fund , the Royal Humane Society , the National Rifle Association , the National Scout Council and the Thames Group Hospitals .
He was President of the Association of Chief Police Officers -LRB- ACPO -RRB- in 1962 .
They already knew each other from Portsmouth , where their mothers had both worked at Agnes Weston 's Sailors Rest ; Callaghan had tried unsuccessfully to court Young 's sister , Eileen .
He fought for the recruitment and promotion of women .
From November 1940 he was seconded by the Home Office for six months to Coventry after its blitz . He ran the city 's police because the Chief Constable was fully occupied as Civil Defense Controller Young started the `` good neighbor scheme '' for bombed out civilians that he had trialled in Leamington and which was later adopted nationally by the Home Office .
The base of the pillar contained first aid equipment while , a Leamington innovation , a flashing red light on the top called up policemen on patrol .
Young was promoted to Inspector -LRB- equivalent to Lieutenant in US police forces -RRB- in June 1937 and appointed to Portsmouth 's Southern Division .
On 11 April 1939 , at Boarhunt parish church , Hampshire , he married Ivy Ada May Hammond -LRB- born 20 December 1909 -RRB- , a nurse from the Royal Portsmouth Hospital whom he had courted for years - custom then dictated lengthy enagements and police pay then was very low .
He relished command of a force small enough to know every constable well .
In November 1969 -LRB- until 1970 -RRB- Young was seconded to be the last Inspector-General and the first Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary .
He enjoyed the City 's rich social life too , and he much valued the invitation to join the Goldsmiths Company .
During these years , Young was also entrusted with what he later called `` enquiries concerning the activities of subversive persons and propaganda , and also with other matters affecting state security '' - looking for spies .
He was Commissioner of Police of the City of London from 1950 to 1971 and was also the first head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be called the Chief Constable , instead of Inspector-General .
While he was there , he led investigations into murder , blackmail , fraud and arson .
On 16 April 1970 , he married Mrs Ileen Fryer Turner -LRB- nÃ e Rayner , born 19 April 1914 -RRB- , whom he had known since she was his police driver in Birmingham during the war and who at one time had been the mistress of his great friend Sir Edward -LRB- ` Ted ' -RRB- Dodd , Chief Constable of Birmingham and later Chief Inspector of Constabulary .
Young realized that the police could no longer rely on habits little changed for a century .
The police under his command found him forceful but gracious , intolerant of failings in himself as well as others .
Before the course was finished , he was transferred to the instructing staff and in June 1943 he was appointed the first commandant of the new Police Civil Affairs Training Centre at Peel House in London -LRB- with a rank as if he was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the army -RRB- . He had to set up the training school for policemen and provost officers -LRB- military police -RRB- who would keep law and order in Axis territory as it was liberated by advancing Allied forces .
Shocked by the poverty and injustice which he discovered , Young became a staunch Christian socialist and , very rare for a chief constable , a life-long Labor Party voter .
He was one of the youngest men ever to become a Chief Constable .
Almost at the same time , Young was appointed by the Home Office to a committee chaired by Sir Percy Sillitoe , Chief Constable of Kent , to see if all forces needed wireless networks .
From Hertfordshire , he set the pace in revitalising county police forces , pushing his police authority to spend a lot of money to improve officers ' pay and conditions .
Callaghan was now a junior minister at the Ministry of Transport .
He applied unsuccessfully to be chief constable of Kent in 1946 , but his next job was offered to him .
On the advice of Thomas Davies , the Chief Constable , he first took a course in business and accountancy .
One year later , he was appointed to the permanent post of Chief Constable .
The young man whose own family had thought that being a policeman was far from suitable dedicated his own long career to making the police a respected and attractive profession .
In his first nine months in Leamington he persuaded the council to hire an extra twelve officers , the first increase since 1915 .
In February 1943 Young was one of the chief constables sent to the War Office Civil Affairs Training Centre for the first course for senior officers .
They met up with each other again on a road safety committee and became working allies to extend speed restrictions and improve road markings ; cat 's eyes were perhaps the most significant fruit of their labors .
It was also during these years that he acquired his passion for ever better police equipment and his personal love of new gadgets .
In all his forces , he was popular with all ranks under his command .
To make it as effective as possible , the Home Office accepted his idea that the wireless network cover more than one county so the neighbouring county force of Bedfordshire was added .
He engineered a national recruitment revolution in the British police , running command courses and seeing through a fast-track entry scheme to attract graduates - and for many years he was director of extended interviews for the Senior Command Course that he had founded .
Young 's father 's business partner Alderman Sir John Henry Corke -LRB- 1850 -- 1927 -RRB- helped Young get his first job in the Chief Constable 's office -LRB- the post of Cadet Clerk was specially created for him -RRB- in December 1924 .
Young was awarded the King 's Police Medal -LRB- KPM -RRB- in 1952 and was appointed Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George -LRB- CMG -RRB- in 1953 and Commander of the Royal Victorian Order -LRB- CVO -RRB- in 1962 .
The models Young developed in Italy were later applied across Allied occupied Europe in 1944 -- 1945 , but his proudest achievement was the restoration and reorganisation of the Carabinieri , with whom he maintained an association for the rest of his life .
I believe in doing everything reasonably possible by way of improving the conditions and amenities for all ranks of the service , and in particular in delegating both authority and responsibility to officers according to their rank .
Young was born in Eastleigh , Hampshire , the third of four children of Edwin Young -LRB- 1878 -- 1936 -RRB- , a builder and contractor , and his wife Gertrude Mary -LRB- nÃ e Brown ; 1880 -- 1945 -RRB- .
Colonel Sir Arthur Edwin Young , KBE , CMG , CVO , KStJ , KPM -LRB- 15 February 1907 â `` 20 January 1979 -RRB- was a British police officer .
He also fell in love with Italy , returning regularly and frequently holidaying in Positano and visiting his wartime friend Colonel Alfredo `` Freddy '' Zanchino of the Carabinieri .
Pay and allowances were increased , housing modernized , and catering improved .
In March 1950 Young became the first former constable to be appointed Commissioner of Police of the City of London . He built up his reputation as `` the policeman 's policeman '' .
She died of cancer on 14 September 1956 .
Leamington 's was a very small force and for a year his command was only `` acting '' so , from the start , Young was looking for a permanent as well as a larger command .
Young helped create the post of Chief Inspector of Constabulary .
In the early 1950s , he played a crucial role in policing decolonisation in the British Empire , and developedg a model of public service policing that was not liked by everyone in some colonies but which time has shown to have been a good idea .
He also reorganised the borough 's fire brigade , and , among other police innovations , set up twelve of `` police pillars '' , a network of two-way microphone handsets across the borough so that the public could contact police stations and civil defense posts directly .
The Home Secretary knew that the nation 's police forces were stuck to old ways and needed the shake-up that the young chief constable had already delivered in Hertfordshire ; Scotland Yard must not be left out .
In Eastney and Southsea , he first had to deal with the problems created by traffic , including ways for its efficient control and of the need to promote road safety .
Having done this I am prepared to accept nothing but the highest standard of service by way of return . ''
Guided by his curate , the Reverend Frederick Dillistone , later Dean of Liverpool , he decided that he must seek ordination -LRB- become a priest -RRB- .
So impressed was Home Secretary James Chuter Ede , he appointed Young to the vacant post of Assistant Commissioner `` D '' of the Metropolitan Police in London , in charge of organization , recruitment , training and communications .
James Callaghan , then Home Secretary , sent him to carry out the Hunt Report , which introduced the standard British rank system for police officers in Northern Ireland and disbanded the controversial Ulster Special Constabulary .
His mother and grandmother never approved because they thought the police an unsuitable career for a young man from an middle-class family . When his maternal aunt Emma Brown married Superintendent Samuel Bowles of the Hampshire Constabulary , she made him resign .
Throughout his career , he sought out contact with clergymen and in the later 1960s , encouraged by the Bishop of London , again considered Anglican ordination .
After several unsuccessful applications -LRB- the East Riding of Yorkshire Constabulary in 1939 , Portsmouth City Police in 1940 , Oxford City Police in 1940 -RRB- , in September 1941 he was selected from a short-list of six as Senior Assistant Chief Constable of Birmingham City Police , then the second-largest police force in the UK ; the salary was Â # 1,000 p.a. .
Within `` D '' Department , Young delivered all the Home Secretary had hoped for , a success that only alienated the hierarchy even further .
He chaired the Police Council for the UK , the Association of Chief Police Officers training centres committee and the education committee of the National Police Fund .
Young persuaded his police authority to fund a building program so that in six years every married man in the county force would have a police house ; the design and equipping of these houses was agreed between the county architects and a `` housing committee '' , recruited through the county Police Federation , not only of men of all ranks but , at Young 's insistence , of officers ' wives .
Young was a keen motorist , who moved from a motorcycle to a series of fast cars .
They had one son , Christopher John Young , born in 1941 .
In June 1932 , aged 25 , he became the youngest Detective Sergeant in the United Kingdom , serving with the Northern Division CID .
In the 1980s , she declined a proposal of marriage from Sir Graham Shillington , Young 's successor as Chief Constable of the RUC .
She died on 31 December 2002 .
Young married Mrs Margaret Furnival Homan , nÃ e Dolphin , in 1957 .
At another level , he pushed through changes in career structures .
Young came to love the City of London .
They worked together again when Callaghan was Home Secretary and it was Callaghan who selected Young to go to Ulster in 1969 to implement the Hunt Report .
In Italy , Young commanded not just British officers but the 120,000 men of the entire Italian police and had responsibility for all Italian prisons , fire brigades and civil defense .
In Birmingham he started to experiment with police training .
The Bishop of Portsmouth , Neville Lovett , however , rejected his application to attend theological college , telling him at interview that `` policemen do not become priests '' .
Aged sixteen , he left to join the Portsmouth Borough Police , against his family 's wishes .
He also made Birmingham the foremost British force in the use of police wireless by establishing in 1942 a `` duplex '' ultra high-frequency two-way radio telephone system linking every police station and every police car .
Young was brought up in a household with strong Anglican evangelical beliefs -LRB- the family attended St Jude 's , Southsea for matins and evensong every Sunday as well as week-day meetings -RRB- . He also patrolled Portsmouth 's slums and docks as a young constable , and this had an effect on Young .
Things , however , did not go well .
His time at Hertfordshire also saw the start of a professional relationship with James Callaghan .
He wanted to follow Sir Robert Peel 's intention that the police be `` filled from the bottom up '' .
During the 1960s , he led the way in modernizing British police recruitment and in improving the training of senior officers .
He played NCAA hockey at the University of Minnesota Duluth and was an All-American his senior year .
After graduation , he played in the AHL with the Nova Scotia Voyageurs and the Cincinnati Swords .
Bosniuk played most of his career in the WHA with the Minnesota Fighting Saints , New England Whalers and Edmonton Oilers .
He took First Team AHL All-Star honors .
After retiring as a player , Busniuk became a coach .
He was later inducted into the Northern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame and the University of Minnesota Duluth Athletic Hall of Fame .

If you are here because this happened to you , there are two possibilities .
Users may be blocked from changing Wikipedia by administrators to stop damage or disruption to Wikipedia .
Also , if the reviewing administrator decides that the block was justified , she will not unblock you unless she is convinced that you understand what you are blocked for , and that you will not do it again .
First , the blocking administrator provides a brief reason that you will see when you try to make an edit .
Do n't forget to insert your own reason .
This is because almost all blocks are found to be justified .
Wikipedia policy on open proxies is clear : they are blocked for a long time without exception once identified .
While some users can use them to circumvent censorship or filters , they have been used far too many times by far too many blocked vandals for Wikipedians to assume good faith on their part .
As a user requesting to be unblocked , it is your responsibility to tell clearly and briefly , in easily readable English , why your block violated Wikipedia 's blocking policy .
But if yours is the rare exception , you should try to make it as easy as possible for the reviewing administrator to see why .
This is done because it is the account name , not the behavior of the person behind it , which is the problem .
Blocks are lifted if they are not -LRB- or no longer -RRB- needed to stop such damage or disruption .
They are usually one or more from among the following : Vandalism , sockpuppetry , spamming or having a bad username .
To contest your block well , you must understand the reason for it .
Accusations of sockpuppetry result in many blocks and almost as many unblock requests , as Wikipedia policy calls for the sockpuppet account to be blocked indefinitely and the sockpuppeteer to be blocked for some length of time .
Users confirmed or believed to have engaged in the practice must request unblock at their main account .
An account with a username that indicates that they are trying to be disruptive , uses hateful or obscene language or otherwise shows that the user has disruptive or provocative intent will be hard blocked , meaning that an unblock request will be required .
Sometimes readers who have never or rarely changed before , or not from that location , with no goal of making an account , click on `` change this page '' only to find that changing from their IP address is blocked , for something they did n't do .
These messages should include the names or abbreviations of those of our site rules -LRB- the `` policies and guidelines '' -RRB- that the blocking administrator believes you have violated .
Even without the use of Checkuser , or with a result of `` unrelated '' , an account that makes the same changes as a different blocked account , has the same linguistic peculiarities and the same general interests may remain blocked .
Administrators are volunteers ; most do not want to make much more of an effort in reviewing your request than you did in writing it .
You may have changed the password , but administrators have no way of knowing if it was even you who did this .
Wikipedia admins can never be absolutely sure about sockpuppetry , and the most abusive users can be very sneaky in trying to stop detection .
If you state in your request that the changes which led to your block were made by someone else who logged on to your account without your knowledge or permission , we will have to leave it blocked and request that you start over with a new account .
To make an unblock request , copy the following text to the bottom of your user talk page : .
If your server has been blocked as an open proxy , you will probably need to change using another connection : in most cases , proxies are `` hard blocked '' , which stops even logged-in users from using the connection to change .
Before you make an unblock request , you should read the policies and guidelines named in your block reason .
Accounts with usernames that violate the username policy are often blocked indefinitely , regardless of their changing behavior .
Most administrators consider such an unblock request a sure sign of a sock account -LRB- particularly one with very few changes otherwise -RRB- and will decline on that basis .
Whichever method you choose , it is a good idea to have some review of the proposed new username first , to avoid ending up in the same quandary .
If made repeatedly , they may also lead to your block being made longer or to your talk page being protected .
Second , he may leave a message explaining your block on your user talk page .
Meatpuppets will be blocked indefinitely , too ... do n't change on behalf of someone else , no matter how well you may know them .
Most such accounts are soft-blocked , meaning a new account may be created while the old one is blocked .
` Do not ' make an unblock request that includes a request for checkuser to `` prove your innocence '' . Those are rarely done that you 're better off not asking .
While it is possible to request a change in username , this takes a little longer and requires that a user with bureaucrat access do so .
This includes Tor nodes .
It may help with your unblock request if you understand how they are reviewed , and by who .
In practice , almost all unblock requests are declined .
If you are improperly blocked for sockpuppetry , you should realize that it may not always be easy or even possible to correct the situation .
You should also review the blocking policy .
Requests such as these are likely to be denied .
This is a guide to making persuasive unblock requests .
You are told about the block reason in two ways .

The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God , are quoted in defense of the view that `` murder '' is more accurate .
Hatred of Jews is apparent in the Council of Laodicea -LRB- 4th Century AD -RRB- where Canon 37 â `` 38 states : `` It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics , nor to feast together with them . '' and `` It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews , nor to be partakers of their impiety . ''
Furthermore , the Hebrew word for `` kill '' is '' '' ' '' - `` harog '' , while the Hebrew word for `` murder '' is '' -- '' - `` retzach '' , which is found in the Ten Commandments '' -- '' - `` lo tirtzach '' .
There is controversy as to which translation is more faithful , and both forms are quoted in support of ethical standpoints .
In keeping with this rejection of the Jews , this Roman council also criminalized the Jewish Sabbath as can be seen in Canon 29 of the Council Laodicea : `` Christians must not Judaize by resting on the Sabbath , but must work on that day , rather honoring the Lord 's Day ; and , if they can , resting then as Christians .
Most Christians believe that Sunday is a special day of worship and rest . It is there to remember the Resurrection of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar .
As a result , many Roman Catholic churches and services feature images or statues .
Various religions divide the commandments differently .
In reference to Acts 20:7 , the disciples came together on the first day of the week -LRB- Sunday -RRB- to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul .
Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd and 3rd century , by most until the 4th and 5th century , and a few thereafter , but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish-Roman wars , the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship .
Jews had come to be hated in the Roman Empire after the Jewish-Roman wars . This led to the criminalization of the Jewish Sabbath .
Jewish translations almost all use `` murder '' , including the Jewish Publication Society of America Version -LRB- 1917 -RRB- , the Judaica Press tanach -LRB- 1963 -RRB- and the Living Torah -LRB- 1981 -RRB- .
Still others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on the Saturday , reserving Sunday as a day of worship .
Many academic theologians -LRB- such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt : Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog -LRB- 1953 -RRB- -RRB- suggest that commandment `` you shall not steal '' was originally intended against stealing people â '' against abductions and slavery . This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as `` you shall not kidnap '' -LRB- e.g. as stated by Rashi -RRB- .
In particular , the Orthodox have criticized the Roman Catholic use of decorative statues , Roman Catholics have criticized the Orthodox veneration of icons , and some Protestant groups have criticized the use of stained-glass windows by other denominations .
They argue that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism , specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism -LRB- in which sun-god worship took place on Sunday -RRB- . This is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the seventh day holy .
The Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the Qur ` an but each is implied by the following verses in the Quran -LRB- using Jewish numbering -RRB- :
Instead , they keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God 's work of creation believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed .
One understanding on this comes from Roman Catholicism : they hold that `` likenesses '' may be built and used , as long as the object is not worshipped .
A Jewish exception is the Artscroll or Stone Edition tanach -LRB- 1996 -RRB- .
English translations using `` kill '' include the King James -LRB- Authorised -RRB- -LRB- 1611 -RRB- -LRB- although note Matthew `` do no murder '' , following the Vulgate non homicidium facies -RRB- , the American Standard -LRB- 1901 -RRB- and Revised Standard -LRB- American Protestant , 1952 -RRB- Versions .
The history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the Roman Empire and the clergy of the Catholic Church .
The Vulgate -LRB- Latin -RRB- translation has Non occides , i.e. `` Thou shalt not kill '' .
For this reason , the obligation to keep the Sabbath is not the same for Christians as for Jews . They say there are examples in the New Testament , and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries .
The Seventh-day Adventists and other churches disagree with some of these views .
Various translations exist of the sixth commandment ; the Hebrew words -- are translated either as `` thou shalt not kill '' or `` thou shalt not murder '' .
These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments , and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments , now known as the Ritual Decalogue -LRB- as opposed to the better-known `` Ethical Decalogue '' -RRB- .
Protestant translations using `` murder '' include the New International Version -LRB- American , 1978 -RRB- , New American Standard Bible -LRB- American , 1971 -RRB- , New English Bible -LRB- British Protestant , 1970 -RRB- , and the New King James -LRB- American , 1982 -RRB- , New Revised Standard -LRB- American , 1989 -RRB- and English Standard -LRB- American Protestant , 2001 -RRB- Versions .
Jews and Muslims read this commandment as prohibiting the use of idols and images in any way .
But if any shall be found to be judaizers , let them be anathema -LRB- excommunicated -RRB- from Christ . ''
Some Protestants will allow pictures Jesus in his human form , while refusing to make any image of God or Jesus in Heaven .
Martin Luther -LRB- German , 1534 -RRB- also uses tÃ ten -LRB- kill -RRB- .
The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten imperative statements , there are 14 or 15 in all .
See Great Apostasy .
For Jews and Muslims , veneration violates this commandment .
Older Protestant translations of the Bible , those based on the Vulgate and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it `` Thou shalt not kill '' . Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use `` You shall not murder '' .
While the Bible itself gives the count as `` 10 '' , using the Hebrew phrase Ê '' aseret had ` varimâ '' translated as the 10 words , statements or things , this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being `` the Ten Commandments '' .
The table below shows those differences .
Amish people forbid any sort of graven image , such as photos .
They say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the Christian day of worship and the Sabbath-day ordinance .
Most Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox understand this practice as fulfilling the observance of the commandment . In their understanding , these images are not being worshipped .
Almost all Roman Catholic translations , including the Douay-Rheims Bible -LRB- 1609\/1752 -RRB- , the New American Bible -LRB- 1970 -RRB- , the New Jerusalem Bible -LRB- 1985 -RRB- and the Christian Community Bible -LRB- 1986 -RRB- , have `` kill '' .
Jehovah 's Witnesses criticize the use of all of the above , as well as the use of the cross .
Many Christians say that a very important element of the commandment not to make `` any image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above '' is `` and bow down and worship it '' .

For searching the web using Forestle is also essentially CO2-neutral : Of course the server computers used by Forestle , the connection network , and the computer of the searching users need electric energy and thus create emissions of carbon-dioxide ; but Forestle purchases an equivalent amount of renewable energy certificates .
The action by google to not support Forestle any more immediately drew international attention .
The certificates are purchased from a part of the 10 % of money left after buying rain forest .
This makes Forestle one of the few web search sites that are `` green certified '' .

Forestle used the search services of Google until Google forbid them to do that after four days of service ; the reasons was that Google and Forestle had a fight : it was not clear whether Forestle broke the terms of service fixed in the contract between them .
As of October 2009 , about 1,991,055 square meters of rain forest have been saved .
Forestle.org states that google did not actually give reasons for stopping their service .
It also offers special features , for example a preview of the websites found during a search .

The Niger is the third-longest river in Africa . -LRB- Only by the Nile and the Congo are longer .
The Niger River is quite a clear river . It has only 10 % as much sediment as the Nile because the Niger 's source is in very old rocks that have little silt .
This unusual route happened because the Niger River is two ancient rivers which are joined together .
The northern part of the river , which is called the Niger bend , is important because it is the Sahara Desert 's closest big river .
Like the Nile , the Niger River has a flood every year ; this starts in September , becomes strongest in November , and finishes by May .
Therefore , trade across the west of the Sahara came here , and it became the center of the Sahelian kingdoms of Mali and Gao .
This makes a region of connected streams , marshes , and lakes over an amount of land the same size as Belgium . The yearly floods make the delta very good for fishing and farming .
The upper Niger , from the source , past Timbuktu , to the bend in the river , used to empty into a lake , but the lake has now gone . However , the lower Niger started in hills near the lake and flowed south into the Gulf of Guinea .
It has a crescent shape and it goes through Guinea , Mali , Niger , on the border with Benin and then through Nigeria . Finally , it reaches the sea at a large delta , called the Niger Delta of the Oil Rivers .
Its main tributary is the Benue River .
Its source is only 240 km -LRB- 150 miles -RRB- from the Atlantic Ocean , but the river flows away from the sea into the Sahara Desert , then turns near the ancient city of Timbuktu -LRB- Tombouctou -RRB- . From here , it goes southeast to the Gulf of Guinea .
The people who live beside the river have many names for it , such as Jeliba or Joliba -LRB- `` great river '' in Manding -RRB- , Isa Ber -LRB- `` big river '' in Songhay -RRB- , Oya , -LRB- a Yoruba River Niger goddess -RRB- , and Kworra or Quorra .

Salvador Dali is one artist who would exemplify visionary art that is neither religious nor primitive .
A vision can be political , religious , environmental , social , or technological in nature .
One example is Hildegard of Bingen , a 12th century artist\/visionary and Catholic saint .
Artists may produce work loosely categorized as visionary art for its luminous content and\/or for its use of artistic techniques that call for the use of extended powers of perception in the viewer : -LRB- e.g. Gustave Moreau , Samuel Palmer , Jean Delville , Ernst Fuchs , the French Symbolist Odilon Redon , Brion Gysin , Max Ernst , Stanley Spencer , Edward Burne Jones , Adolf Wolfli , Fred Sandback , William Blake , Hieronymus Bosch , and Henry Darger -RRB- .
A visionary state can be achieved via meditation , drugs , lucid dreams , daydreams , or art .
Some visionaries emphasize communication , and some assume a figurehead role in organizing a social group .
Visionary art can be incorrectly defined as a category of primitive art -LRB- art of those not formally trained -RRB- rather than describing people who have used their visions -LRB- or dreams -RRB- to create their paintings .
In that sense , a visionary may also function as a secular prophet .
By extension , a visionary can also be a person with a clear , distinctive and specific -LRB- in some details -RRB- vision of the future , usually connected with advances in technology or social\/political arrangements .
Examples are Buckminster Fuller in architecture and design , and some of the pioneers of personal computing such as Steve Wozniak .
Other visionaries simply imagine what does not yet exist but might some day , as some forms of visioning -LRB- or gazing -RRB- can provide a glimpse into the possible future .
Therefore , visioning can mean seeing in a utopian way what does not yet exist on earth , but might exist in another realm , such as the ideal or perfect realm as imagined or thought .
Defined broadly , a visionary , is one who can envision the future .
For some groups , this can involve the supernatural or use of mind-altering drugs .
Some people use mathematics to make visionary discoveries in the nature of the universe .
For example , Ted Nelson or U.S. Vice President Al Gore is referred to as a visionary in connection with the Internet .
Other visionaries in religion are Mohammed -LRB- who had a vision of and communed with the Angel Gabriel -RRB- , St. Bernadette -LRB- who had a vision of contact with the Blessed Virgin -RRB- , and Joseph Smith -LRB- who had a vision of contact with the Angel Moroni -RRB- .

Early spectroscopes were simply a prism with graduations marking wavelengths of light .
Spectroscopes are used often in astronomy and some branches of chemistry .
A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities .
In general , any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum .
Modern spectroscopes , such as monochromators , generally use a diffraction grating , a movable slit , and some kind of photodetector , all automated and controlled by a computer .
Spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths , from gamma rays and X-rays into the far infrared .
Below optical frequencies -LRB- that is , at microwave , radio , and audio frequencies -RRB- , the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device .
The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light .
The variable measured is most often the light 's intensity but could also , for instance , be the polarization state .

LC circuits are used for creating signals at a particular frequency , or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal .
LC circuit is an electronic circuit made up of an inductor and a capacitor .
Resultingly the series connected circuit , when connected to a circuit in series , will act as a band-pass filter having zero impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuits .
The angular frequency Ï has units of radians per second .
The total impedance is given by the sum of the inductive and capacitive impedances
First consider the Electrical impedance of the series LC circuit .
Resultingly the parallel connected circuit will act as band-stop filter having infinite impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit .
The total impedance is then given by
At LC circuit energy also save in the inductor 's magnetic field .
The same analysis may be applied to the parallel LC circuit .

Edward Adlebert Doisy -LRB- November 13 , 1892 - October 23 , 1986 -RRB- was an American biochemist .
He won the 1943 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , along with Henrik Dam , for the discovery of Vitamin K.
The discovery images were taken on May 15 , 2005 and May 18 , 2005 ; the moons were independently found by Max J. Mutchler on June 15 , 2005 and Andrew J. Steffl on August 15 , 2005 .
However , Hubble observations in 2005-6 , specifically targeting the dim moons , once again showed Hydra to be a little brighter .
The discoveries were announced on October 31 , 2005 , after confirmation by precoveries from 2002 .
At the time of discovery , Hydra was about 25 percent brighter than its sister moon Nix , which led to the assumption that its diameter was some 10 percent bigger .
It was found along with Nix in June , 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope 's Pluto Companion Search Team , which is composed of Hal A. Weaver , Alan Stern , Max J. Mutchler , Andrew J. Steffl , Marc W. Buie , William J. Merline , John R. Spencer , Eliot F. Young , and Leslie A. Young .
Hydra is to be visited along with Pluto by the New Horizons mission in 2015 .
Hydra appears to be gray like Charon and Nix , though Pluto is reddish .
The moons were provisionally designated S\/2005 P 1 -LRB- Hydra -RRB- and S\/2005 P 2 -LRB- Nix -RRB- .
The name Hydra was announced on June 21 , 2006 , in IAU Circular 8723 , along with the formal designation Pluto III .
Its orbital period of 38.2 days .
Pre-discovery data from Hubble observations in 2002-3 inferred that Nix was the brighter moon .
Hydra is the farthest moon of Pluto .
Although its size has not been directly measured , calculations based on its brightness give it a diameter of between 61 km , if its reflectivity is similar to Charon 's 35 percent , and about 167 km , if it has a reflectivity of 4 percent like the darkest Kuiper belt objects -LRB- KBOs -RRB- .
Unlike other moons of Pluto , its orbit is only nearly circular ; its eccentricity of 0.0052 is small , but significantly non-zero .
The moon orbits the barycenter of the system in the same plane as Charon and Nix , at a distance of about 65,000 km .

However , Luther and a ZÃ 1\/4 rich reformer Huldrych Zwingli thought differently about the eucharist .
The grammar school was called the collÃ ge or schola privata . The other part was an advanced school called the acadÃ mie or schola publica .

On the next day , he was buried in an unmarked grave in the CimetiÃ re de Plainpalais .
On 25 April , he made his will . In his will , he left a little money to his family and to the collÃ ge .
At the same time , Calvin was sad that the reformers were not all together .
With the city 's protection , they could make their own reformed church under John Knox and William Whittingham . They later carried many of Calvin 's ideas back to England and Scotland .
In five years there were 1,200 students in the grammar school and 300 in the advanced school .
In autumn 1558 , Calvin became ill with a fever .
Between 1555 and 1562 , over one hundred ministers were sent to France .

He preached his last sermon in St. Pierre on 6 February 1564 .

Most British orders of chivalry cover all of the United Kingdom , but the three most most senior ones each cover only one constituent country .
Each year , the Sovereign stays at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in June or July ; during the visit , a service for the Order is held .
Knights and Ladies of the Thistle may also have their knighthoods taken away .
Its equivalent in England , The Most Noble Order of the Garter , is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom , dating to the middle fourteenth century .
After he won the battle , Achaius established the Order of the Thistle .
Aside from these special occasions , however , much simpler badges are used whenever a member of the Order attends an event at which decorations are worn .
In 1703 however , Anne once again revived the Order of the Thistle .
James VII was deposed by 1688 and the Order did not have a Chapel until 1911 , when one was added onto St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh .
But this has happened only once , to John Erskine , 6th Earl of Mar who was deprived of both the knighthood and the earldom after taking part in the Jacobite rising of 1715 .
In 1783 an Irish order , The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick , was founded ; but since the independence of the Republic of Ireland the Order has fallen dormant .
King James II and VII issued letters patent `` reviving and restoring the Order of the Thistle to its full glory , lustre and magnificency '' in 1687 .
George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage , rather than to reward actual merit .
The Order of the Thistle , which covers to Scotland , is the second-most senior in precedence .
St Andrew is also the patron saint of the Order .
King -LRB- -LRB- Olav V King of Norway Olav V of Norway -RRB- -RRB- , was the first foreigner to be admitted to the Order , was also admitted by specialpermission in 1962 .

Any new Knights or Ladies are installed at annual services .
Members of the British Royal Family are normally admitted by special permission ; the first was Prince Albert .

He or she is not advised by the Government , as occurs with most other Orders .
Another story says that the Order was instituted , or re-instituted by Robert I at the Battle of Bannockburn .
Therefore in 1946 , with the agreement of the Prime Minister -LRB- Clement Attlee -RRB- and the Leader of the Opposition -LRB- Winston Churchill -RRB- , both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign .
The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle is an order of chivalry associated with Scotland .
Women were excluded from the Order . George VI created his wife Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon a Lady of the Thistle in 1937 , and in 1987 Elizabeth II allowed the regular admission of women to both the Order of the Thistle and the Order of the Garter .
The Sovereign has historically had the power to choose Knights of the Order .
From time to time , individuals joined the Order by special permission .
Only 12 knights were allowed , and he appointed eight before the King was deposed in 1688 .
Knights and Ladies of the Thistle may also be admitted to the Order of the Garter .
While its original date of foundation is unknown , James VII -LRB- also King of England as James II -RRB- created the modern Order in 1687 .
When James VII revived the Order , the statutes said that the Order would continue the ancient number of Knights , which was described in the preceding warrant as `` the Sovereign and twelve Knights-Brethren in allusion to the Blessed Saviour and his Twelve Apostles .
The motto is Nemo me impune lacessit -LRB- Latin for `` No one provokes me with impunity '' -RRB- ; the same motto also appears on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and on some pound coins .

Data from the Kepler mission suggests there are at least 50 billion planets in our own galaxy .
Making a comparison to the Sun 's planets , he wrote `` And if the fixed stars are the centers of similar systems , they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of One . ''
In the eighteenth century the same possibility was mentioned by Isaac Newton in his Principia .
These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar , in a second round of planet formation , or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits .
These advances allowed astronomers to detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their gravitational influence on the motion of their parent stars .
An extrasolar planet -LRB- also known as exoplanet -RRB- is a natural planet that exists outside of our solar system .
There also exist planets that orbit brown dwarfs and free floating planets that orbit the galaxy directly just as the stars do . It is unclear if either type should be called a `` planet '' .
Technological advances , most notably in high-resolution spectroscopy , led to the detection of many new exoplanets at a rapid rate .
In the sixteenth century the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno , an early supporter of the Copernican theory that the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun , put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets .
In early 1992 , radio astronomers announced the discovery of planets around another pulsar .
On October 6 , 1995 , Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star -LRB- 51 Pegasi -RRB- .
This discovery , made at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence , ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery .
Additional extrasolar planets were eventually detected by observing the variation in a star 's apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet passed in front of it .

Blocking an IP address listed in this section can cause undesired effects on Wikipedia , which varies depending on the IP address in question .
If you are unsure as to how to do this correctly , please do not issue the block , but contact another admin .
For anonymous-only blocks of Shared IP addresses , please consider using or as your blocking reason .
These ranges are allocated to major governmental organizations and blocks of these organizations have political and public relations implications that must be managed by the Foundation 's press relations team .
Most IP addresses should not be blocked more than a few hours , since the malicious user will probably move on by the time the block expires .
IP blocks can be more powerful and effective , but also have additional ramifications .
Use careful judgement and make them as brief as possible ; this can affect over sixty-five thousand IP addresses , potentially affecting millions of users .
Administrators can block ranges of IP addresses -LRB- commonly called rangeblocking -RRB- .
For more information , see .
This can compound the autoblock problem , particularly when they are also shared , because a block targeted at a malicious user may shift to a legitimate user while the target shifts to an unblocked IP address .
Open proxies should generally be reported to the WikiProject on open proxies and blocked for the length of time they are likely to remain both static and open , which in most cases is likely to be under two years .
Many open proxies have been blocked indefinitely , but this is becoming less common .
Block lengths should typically range from several weeks for dynamic IPs and short term Tor nodes , up to several years for long term proxies hosted on static IP addresses .
The IP should not be unblocked until the proxy has been closed .
Please issue soft blocks on any bot coming from this address , and ensure that you immediately unblock the Toolserver IP address after performing a block on a bot hosted here .
If you block an IP address in any of the following ranges , you are required to immediately notify the Wikimedia Foundation Communications Committee at m : Communications committee\/Notifications .
Because the IPs may eventually be reassigned or the proxies closed , blocks should not be indefinite , but in some cases can be very long term .
If the IP belongs to anything that might be closely related to the above , or a major corporation , for example Microsoft , Sun , etc. it can be a good idea to notify the committee .
If there is persistent disruption or vandalism from an IP address , the block should be extended -LRB- with the ` anon-only ' option selected -RRB- as long as is necessary to prevent further disruption .
Users operating from dynamic IP addresses change IP addresses periodically .
Since it is impossible to distinguish between individual users operating from shared IP addresses , blocking one may affect a very large number of legitimate users -LRB- ranging up to millions -RRB- .
If you do n't , many other administrators doâ '' ask on the Administrators ' incidents noticeboard or on -LRB- irc : \/ \/ irc.freenode.net/wikipedia IRC -RRB- .
Long-term blocks should never be used for isolated incidents .
Avoid long blocks of these addresses and be especially careful in formulating your block messages because your block message will be seen and commented on by the press .
You need some knowledge of how networks and IP numbering work , and of binary arithmetic .
Open proxies may be blocked on sight according to the policy on open proxies .
Blocks should be based on the protection of Wikipedia rather than the punishment of offenders .
In extreme cases , consider long-term blocks over a period of months or years instead .
These should be reserved as an absolute last resort .
Before implementing a long-term block on an IP address with a long history of vandalism , please check if it is shared by performing a WHOIS and Reverse DNS lookup query on the IP address to determine if it belongs to a school or a proxy server .
IP addresses can be blocked by administrators in the same way as registered users are .
Many IP addresses are dynamically assigned and change frequently from one person to the next , and even static IP addresses are periodically re-assigned or have different users .
However , IP addresses should almost never be indefinitely blocked .
Many users operate from shared IP addresses , often those belonging to proxies used by large networks or Internet service providers .
If a Shared IP addresse 's talk page is not already identified or tagged as such , use either the and templates to do so .
If you propose to block a significant range , or for a significant time , consider asking a user with checkuser access to check for collateral blocks - that is , for the presence of other users who may be unintentionally affected by the range block .

-LRB- Despite the short season , the long summer days at such latitudes do permit some agriculture . -RRB-
Low precipitation , by the standards of more temperate regions with longer and warmer winters , is typically sufficient in view of the very low evapotranspiration to allow a water-sogged terrain in many areas of subarctic climate .
Summer warmth is insufficient to thaw more than a few surface feet , so permafrost prevails under large areas .
Trees are mostly limited to ferns and evergreen conifers , as few broadleaved trees are able to survive the very low temperatures in winter .
These climates represent KÃ ppen climate classification Dfc , Dwc , Dfd and Dwd .
Some northern areas with subarctic climates located near oceans -LRB- southern Alaska and the northern fringe of Europe -RRB- , have milder winters and no permafrost , and are thus more suited for farming .
Agricultural potential is generally poor , due to the natural infertility of soils and because of the many swamps and lakes left by departing ice sheets , and short growing seasons allow only the hardiest of crops .
Vegetation in a subarctic climate is generally of low diversity , because only hardy species can survive the long winters and make use of the short summers .
Regions having a subarctic climate -LRB- also called boreal climate -RRB- are characterized by long , usually very cold winters , and brief , warm summers .
Even though the diversity may be low , numbers are high , and the taiga -LRB- boreal -RRB- forest is the largest forest biome on the planet , with most of the forests located in Russia and Canada .
Seasonal thaw penetrates from 2 to 14 ft -LRB- 0.6 to 4 m -RRB- , depending on latitude , aspect , and type of ground .
This type of forest is also known as taiga , a term which is sometimes applied to the climate found therein as well .
There is very little precipitation , no more than 15 to 20 inches over an entire year and , away from the coasts , occurs mostly in the warmer months .
It is found on large landmasses , away from the moderating effects of an ocean , generally at latitudes from 50 Â to 70 Â N. Due to the absence of any large landmasses at such latitudes , it is not found in the Southern Hemisphere .
The subarctic climate is a subset of the continental climate .
The frost-free season is very short , varying from about 45 to 100 days at most , and a freeze can occur during any month in many areas .
With 5-7 consecutive months where the average temperature is below freezing , all moisture in the soil and subsoil freezes solidly to depths of many feet .
This type of climate offers some of the most extreme seasonal temperature variations found on the planet : In winter , temperatures can drop to 40 Â C -LRB- also 40 Â F -RRB- and in summer , the temperature may exceed 30 Â C -LRB- 86 Â F -RRB- .
Poleward or even approaching polar seas , the warmest month has an average temperature of less than 10 Â C -LRB- 50 Â F -RRB- , and the subarctic climate grades into a tundra climate even less suitable for trees .
However , the summers are short ; no more than three months of the year -LRB- but at least one month -RRB- and must have a 24-hour average temperature of at least 10 Â C -LRB- 50 Â F -RRB- to fall into this category of climate .

Although classified as eukaryotes , the dinoflagellate nuclei lack some key features of eukaryotic nuclei .
This group , however , does contain typically eukaryotic organelles , such as golgi complexes , mitochondria and chloroplasts .
In fact , Dodge termed the dinoflagellate nucleus as mesokaryotic , due to its possession of intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well-defined eukaryotic nucleus .
Not all dinoflagellate blooms are dangerous .
They sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre .
Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of bioluminescent dinoflagellates , which emit short flashes of light when disturbed .

The males compete for females during the breeding season .
By 1971 , it was understood that the Kangaroo Island species was the same as the kangaroos of southern Western Australia , and that this population extended through much of the eastern part of the continent as well .
During these `` boxing '' contests , they would lock arms and try to push each other over .
Finally , by the early 1990s , the current understanding emerged .
The Western Grey Kangaroo -LRB- Macropus fuliginosus -RRB- is a large and very common kangaroo or macropod , found right across the southern part of Australia . They are found from just south of Shark Bay in Western Australia to western Victoria .
There are two subspecies of the Western Grey : Macropus fuliginosus fuliginosus which is found on Kangaroo Island , and Macropus fuliginosus melanops , which has a range of different types that change gradually from west to east .
It was first noted by European settlers when the great explorer Matthew Flinders landed on Kangaroo Island in 1802 .
The Western Grey Kangaroo is one of the largest kangaroos .
They never interbreed in the wild , although hybrids between Eastern Grey females and Western Grey males have been produced in captivity .
It has thick , coarse fur with color ranging from pale gray to brown . It has a paler color on its throat , chest and belly .
Flinders shot several for food but assumed that they were Eastern Grey Kangaroos .
In 1803 French explorers captured several Kangaroo Island Western Greys and shipped them home to Paris , where they lived in the zoological gardens for some years .
It has a nickname Stinker because mature males have a curry-like odour .
The kangaroo lives in groups of up to 15 .
There the matter rested for over 100 years , and it was not until 1917 that researchers realized that the `` Forester Kangaroo '' of Tasmania was in fact Macropus giganteus , the same Eastern Grey Kangaroo that was , and still is , widespread in the more fertile south-eastern part of the mainland .
Usually , only the strongest male in the group mates .
For a time , three subspecies were described , two on the mainland and one on Kangaroo Island .
The gestation period is 30-31 days . After the birth , the tiny baby Joey attaches to the teat in the females pouch for nine months .
The subspecies on Kangaroo Island , South Australia , is called the Kangaroo Island Kangaroo .
It exhibits sexual dimorphism with the male up to twice the size of female .

At one time , there were detailed contemporary histories on Caligula , but they are now lost .
However , he started the construction of two new aqueducts in Rome : the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus .
During his reign , the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania and made it into a province .
The conspirators ' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted , as the same day the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula 's uncle Claudius emperor in his place .
Caligula 's father Germanicus , the nephew and adopted son of emperor Tiberius , was a very successful general and one of Rome 's most beloved public figures .
He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself .
After this , the sources focus upon his cruelty , extravagance , and sexual perversity , presenting him as an insane tyrant .
No surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light , but the question of whether or not Caligula was insane remains unanswered .
Caligula worked to increase the authority of the emperor .
This conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family , with Caligula as the sole male survivor .
In early 41 , Caligula was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy involving officers of the Praetorian Guard , as well as members of the Roman Senate and of the imperial court .
At the death of Tiberius in 37 , Caligula succeeded his great-uncle and adoptive grandfather .
Surviving sources present a number of stories about Caligula that illustrate cruelty and insanity .
The history of Caligula 's reign is a problem . Only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived â '' the works of Philo and Seneca , and they give mostly anecdotes .
When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 AD , his mother Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with her six children where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius .
Unscathed by the deadly intrigues , Caligula accepted the invitation to join the emperor on the island of Capri in 31 , where Tiberius himself had withdrawn five years earlier .
There are few surviving sources on Caligula 's reign , although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule .
Caligula 's sister , Agrippina the Younger , wrote an autobiography which certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula 's reign , but it too is lost .

As of 1 January 2009 , it had a population of 4,850 and an area of 5.3 kmÂ .
During WWII the Kingdom of Italy annexed , to the newly created Governatorato di Dalmazia , most of Dalmatia .
It has increased to influence totally the dalmatian culture during the times of the Republic of Venice and the Italian Renaissance .
After WWI Italy obtained Zara and some northern Dalmatian islands -LRB- Cherso and Lussino -RRB- .
So , in the early Middle ages , the coastal area of Dalmatia retained its original latinised culture , mainly on the islands and cities such as Zara , Spalato , Ragusa and Cattaro .
It was founded and published by the Italian Bartolomeo Benincasa in 1806 .
In those centuries , the most southern area of Dalmatia was called Albania veneta , now called coastal Montenegro .
Perasto had the privilege to keep war-flag of the Venetian Navy in the peace time -LRB- it was called `` La fedelissma Gonfaloniera '' -RRB- .
When Austria occupied Dalmatia there was a revival of the Slav people inside Dalmatia .
The Republic of Venice controlled most of Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797 .
In 1880 Antonio Bajamonti -LRB- the last Dalmatian Italian Major of Spalato under Austrian rule -RRB- developed an urbanization project of this city centered on the `` Riva '' , a seaside walkway full of palms based on the Italian Riviera models .
The sailormen of Perasto were involved in the last battle of the Venitian navy , fought in Venice in 1797 .
At the fall of the `` Serenissima '' -LRB- 1797 -RRB- Perasto was the last city of the Repubblic to lower the Venetian flag .
The Venetian possessions were called `` Venetian Dalmatia '' and enjoyed a flourishing period of economic bonanza with huge development of the arts and culture .
In those years the scholastic system was expanded to all the population -LRB- following the ideals of the French Revolution -RRB- and the Italian language was instituted as the official language in the schools of Dalmatia .
Zara -LRB- actual Zadar -RRB- was the capital of the Venetian Dalmatia , a role that has maintained through the successive centuries -LRB- during WWII it was the capital of the Italian `` Governatorato di Dalmazia '' -RRB- .
These cities maintained deep cultural and commercial links with the Italian mainland , thanks to intense commerce through the Adriatic sea .
Furthermore there were in the Governatorato 10000 Italians who took the Yugoslav citizenship after WWI , in order to remain there and be accepted without problems by the new Yugoslavian regime after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire .
That means that in only one hundred years -LRB- from the 1850s to the 1950s -RRB- the Dalmatian Italians decreased from 45000 in the 1857 Austrian Census to less than one thousand in the last Croatian and Montenegrin Census .
In 1942 there were 4020 Italians in these newly annexed areas : 2220 in Spalato -LRB- Split -RRB- , 300 in Sebenico -LRB- Sibenik -RRB- , 500 Cattaro -LRB- Kotor -RRB- and 1000 Veglia -LRB- Krk -RRB- .
Starting from the tenth century the Republic of Venice imposed its influence on Dalmatia , gradually assimilating the neolatin Dalmatians while the local Slavs maintained their language .
On 22 August 1797 the Count Giuseppe Viscovich , Captain of Perasto lowered the Venetian war-flag of the Lion of Saint Mark pronouncing the farewell words in front of the crying people of the city and buried the `` Gonfalon of Venice '' under the altar of the main church of Perasto .
Even today the Riva -LRB- with cafe bars -RRB- is used by the locals to stroll in a typical Italian way from the `` Palace of Diocletian '' toward an old square called locally `` Pjaca '' -LRB- or square in venetian -RRB- .
Perasto was at its peak in the 18th century under the Republic of Venice , when it had as many as four active shipyards , a fleet of around one hundred ships , and 1,643 residents .
On 12 May 1797 , the Republic of Venice ended , but a few places in the Albania veneta for several months still continued to remain loyal to the Venetian Repubblic : Perasto was the last place of the Republic to surrender .
Many ornate baroque palaces and magnificent dwelling-houses decorated the town of Perast -LRB- Perasto -RRB- , full of typical venetian architecture .
The cultural influence from the Italian peninsula is extremely important in Dalmatia since the Roman times .
In these centuries , the Venetian language became the `` lingua franca '' of all Dalmatia , assimilating the Dalmatian language of the Romanised Illyrians and influencing partially the coastal Croatian language -LRB- `` Chakavian '' -RRB- and the Albanian language .
The historical influence from the Italian peninsula in Dalmatia started with the Roman conquest of Illyrian Dalmatia .
An enduring example of the Italian cultural and historic presence in Dalmatia is the small town of Perasto -LRB- actually Perast in montenegrin language -RRB- in coastal Montenegro .
The Italian -LRB- venetian speaking -RRB- population , that was -LRB- according to the Italian linguist Bartoli -RRB- nearly one third of the Dalmatians in the second half of the XVIII century , according to the Austrian census decreased from 22 % in 1816 to 12.5 % in 1853 and a mere 2.9 % in 1910 .
During that period , part of its Slavic population was italianised .
In the XIX century the cultural influence from Italy originated the creation in Zara of the first dalmatian newspaper , edited in Italian and Croat : Il Regio Dalmata - Kraglski Dalmatin .
Italian cultural and historic presence in Dalmatia is related to the Italian influence in Dalmatia -LRB- now divided between Croatia , Herzegovina and Montenegro -RRB- from the historical and cultural points of view .
The actual Dalmatians may in part trace their origins back to the Romanised Illyrians during the `` Barbarian Invasions '' of the fifth and sixth centuries when Avars with some Slavs invaded Illyria .
There are still some Dalmatian Italians in Dalmatia : 300 in Croatia and 500 in Montenegro .
After WWII Italy lost all the territories in Dalmatia , and more than 22000 Dalmatian Italians exiled mainly in Italy .
The historian Theodore Mommsen stated in his book History of Rome that all Dalmatia was fully Romanised and Latin speaking by the fourth century .
Dalmatia was greatly influenced by the Italian Renaissance and many buildings , churches and cathedrals were done in those years , from Zara and Spalato to Sebenik and Ragusa -LRB- actual Dubrovnik -RRB- .
The cultural influence from Italy is clearly evident in the urbanization plans of the main Dalmatian cities in the XIX\/XX centuries .
After the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797 to the Napoleon Armies , the Dalmatia was incorporated briefly -LRB- 1805-1809 -RRB- in the `` Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy '' .
According to the `` Comunita ' nazionale italiana del Montenegro '' , in Perast actually there are 140 persons who still speak at home the original venetian dialect of Perasto -LRB- called `` veneto da mar '' -RRB- , and call themselves in the census `` Montenegrins '' .
The Regio Dalmata - Kraglski Dalmatin was stamped in the tipography of Antonio Luigi Battara and was the first done in Croat language .
During those years the original Latin population took refuge in the coastal cities and in the islands , whilst other migrated to the mountains -LRB- they were later called `` Morlachs '' -RRB- .
This invasion opened the way to the settlement of different Slavic tribes -LRB- mainly the `` Croats '' -RRB- .
At that time the most beautiful buildings arose in this fortified town .
The population has since decreased to 430 in 1910 and around 360 today .

Three genera , Uranomys , Lophuromys , and Acomys were once considered to be murines - Later , it was discovered that they were more closely related to gerbils through molecular phylogenetics .
They are the only terrestrial placental mammals native to Australia .
This subfamily is larger than all mammal families except the Cricetidae . It is also larger than all mammal orders except the bats and the remainder of the rodents .
Progonomys is thought to be the ancestor of Mus and relatives , while Karnimata is thought to lead to Rattus and relatives .
The first known appearance of the Murinae in the fossil record is about 14 million years ago with the fossil genus Antemus .
They have also been introduced to all continents except Antarctica . They are serious pest animals .
The vlei rats in the genera Otomys and Parotomys are often placed in a separate subfamily , Otomyinae . They have been shown to be closely related to African murines in spite of their uniqueness .
The Murinae are native to Africa , Europe , Asia , and Australia .
Likewise , two genera , Progonomys and Karnimata are thought to derive directly from Antemus .
No tribal level taxonomy has been attempted for the complete subfamily .
All of these fossils are found in the well-preserved and easily dated Siwalik fossil beds of Pakistan .
Two prominent murine human commensals have become vital laboratory animals .
Most of the Murinae have been poorly studied .
Some genera have been grouped , such as the hydromyine water rats , conilurine or pseudomyine Australian mice , or the phloeomyine Southeast Asian forms .
Antemus is thought to come directly from Potwarmus , which has a more primitive tooth pattern .
It looks like genera from southeast Asian islands and Australia may be early offshoots compared to mainland forms .

Many physicists then developed a theory of electromagnetism now known as classical electromagnetism . James Clerk Maxwell then brought everything together into one theory of electromagnetism .
The electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces of nature .
This concept is used to make electric generators , induction motors , and transformers work .
This type of electromagnetism was based on Maxwell 's equations and the Lorentz force law .

The phrase was first used by Darwin in the 5th edition of The Origin published in 1869 , in which Chapter 4 describes `` Natural Selection , or the Survival of the Fittest '' .
Thus by survival of the fittest , the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power , joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever .
Spencer later published a book called The Man versus the State . There , he used the phrase to explain why societies of a militant type would not adopt his theories .
He first used the term in his book Principles of Biology , published in 1864 . In that book -LRB- vol 1 p444 -RRB- he wrote : `` This survival of the fittest , which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms , is that which Mr. Darwin has called â natural selectionâ , or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life '' .
Darwin agreed that the phrase survival of the fittest was better than natural selection .
Spencer 's Principles of Biology was the first to use the phrase survival of the fittest in print . Darwin agreed that the phrase survival of the fittest was better than natural selection .
In the introduction to the 5th edition Darwin gave full credit to Spencer , writing `` I have called this principle , by which each slight variation , if useful , is preserved , by the term Natural Selection , in order to mark its relation to man 's power of selection .
The way he uses the term suggests he is talking about a general principle .
Survival of the fittest would avoid this problem , but it `` lost the analogy between nature 's selection and the fanciers '' -LRB- breeders -RRB- .

The Great Powers agreed on a substantial Bulgarian autonomy to take the form of two new Ottoman provinces -LRB- vilayets -RRB- established for the purpose : Eastern , with capital Tarnovo , and Western , with capital Sofia .
These territories were to be incorporated into the two Bulgarian autonomous provinces as follows :
The Great Powers elaborated in detail the constitutional , legislative , executive , defense and law enforcement arrangements , cantonal administrative system , taxation , international supervision etc. for the proposed autonomous provinces .
The conference determined that , as of the late 19th century , the Bulgarian ethnic territories within the Ottoman Empire extended to the Danube Delta in the northeast , Kastoria in the southwest , Kirklareli and Edirne in the southeast , and NiÅ in the northwest .
The agreed decisions of the six Great Powers were formally handed over to the Ottoman Government on 23 December 1876 , dismissing the opening Turkish suggestions that the Conference 's mission might have been obviated by a new Ottoman Constitution approved by Sultan Abdul Hamid II that same day .
On his part , Salisbury saw the conference as a promising opportunity for mapping out a comprehensive deal with Russia over their conflicting territorial ambitions in Central Asia .
Although the Turkish representatives participated in the plenaries of the conference , they were not invited to the preceding working sessions at which the Great Powers negotiated their agreement .
Eventually , on 18 January 1877 Grand Vizier Mithat Pasha announced the definitive refusal of Turkey to accept the conference decisions .
Lord Salisbury and Count Ignatyev played a leading role in the process .
Mithat Pasha was the Grand Vizier -LRB- First Minister -RRB- , and Saffet Pasha the Foreign Minister of Turkey .
Count Luigi -LRB- Lodovico -RRB- Corti .
Mithat Pasha , Saffet Pasha and Edhem Pasha .

The 1876 â `` 1877 Constantinople Conference -LRB- or â Shipyard Palace Conferenceâ , from the conference venue -RRB- of the Great Powers -LRB- Britain , Russia , France , Germany , Austria-Hungary and Italy -RRB- was held in Istanbul -LRB- Constantinople -RRB- from 23 December 1876 until 20 January 1877 .
Of these , Lord Salisbury , Count de Chaudordy and Baron von Calice were Ambassadors Plenipotentiary to the conference , while Count Ignatyev , Sir Henry Elliot , Count de Bourgoing , Baron von Werther , Count Zichy and Count Corti were the resident Ambassadors of their countries in Constantinople .
In the subsequent conference plenary sessions Turkey submitted objections and alternative reform proposals that were rejected by the Great Powers , and attempts to bridge the gap did not succeed .
The failure of the Ottoman Government to implement the decisions of the Constantinople Conference triggered the 1877 â `` 1878 Russo-Turkish War , depriving at the same time Turkey â `` in contrast to the preceding 1853 â `` 1856 Crimean War â `` from Western support .

The first guns were the simple shotgun designs already used for birds . They were loaded with solid balls of lead that could shoot long animals .
The safari heyday of the early 20th century ` Nitro era ' records much writing on such calibres as the .577 Nitro Express , .375 H&H Magnum , .416 Rigby , .404 Jeffery , 505 Gibbs , .450 Nitro Express , .470 Nitro Express and many others .
The American gun market made several famous dangerous gun cartridges around this time , such as the .458 Winchester Magnum , .378 Weatherby Magnum and .460 Weatherby Magnum . Many of these were ` wildcatted ' -LRB- to modify an existing case and rifle to fire a different caliber bullet -RRB- .
In a few years the big bore guns disappeared from the gamefields .
During World War I , both the British and Germans used elephant guns taken from their African colonies when they tried to break the stalemate in the trenches .
Likewise , the Germans used a mass-produced anti-tank rifle , the Mauser 1918 TuF Gewehr , to knock out lightly armored British tanks .
The caliber was still measured in bore or gauge - or the guns were named by how much the projectiles -LRB- what was shot out of the guns -RRB- weighed in ounces .
During the African campaign of World War II in 1941 , the Italians in East Africa fought against the British .
Then elephant guns like the .416 Weatherby Magnum and the .416 Remington Magnum were made again .
With smaller metal-cased bullets with sizes from .400 to .620 and speeds around 2000 f , they had a much better trajectory and penetration over the black powder guns .
The necessities for the gun are not only very high power -LRB- any big gun could do that -RRB- , but that it can be carried for long periods , shot from any position , and be well balanced enough to track on rapidly moving animals .
An elephant gun is a large caliber gun , which could be -LRB- but does not have to be -RRB- a rifle . Elephant guns were first made to be used by big-game hunters who were hunting elephants and other large animals . .
Nitro Express elephant guns were first made around 1895 . They used smokeless powder , which was new at the time .
All elephant guns have one idea in common : to have enough stopping power to prevent harm to the hunter in the case of charging game .
The British used elephant guns as a means of getting around the German tactic of having their snipers advance towards Allied lines under the cover of a large , 6-10 millimeter -LRB- 0.24-0 .4 inch -RRB- thick steel plate .
Because they did not kill large animals very easily -LRB- some writers said that it could take up to 35 shots to kill one elephant -RRB- , elephant guns were soon made into larger caliber black powder smoothbores .
The projectiles were lead round balls or short slugs shaped like cones . Sometimes , antimony was put in them to make them harder .
Though normal guns did n't do anything to the plate , the elephant guns had enough force to punch through it .
Other wildcats based on the heavy machine gun .50 BMG and similar anti-materiel rounds have been devised which are much more powerful , though they are not generally useful hunting arms because they are heavier than 25 l.
The rest of the old Nitro express calibers faded to obscurity until people starting safari hunting in the 1970s and 1980s .
The .600 Overkill made by Rob Garnick shows the biggest power that could come from from a standard hunting action .
Then the guns switched roles to tools for game wardens and as backup firearms for professional hunters guiding international hunters .
The Finnish 20 mm anti-tank gun Lahti L-39 had the nickname Norsupyssy -LRB- Elephant Gun -RRB- during the Winter War because of its stopping power .
It is really no more than a very big hunting rifle with the same use as any hunting rifle .
It is not a true elephant gun , though , since it was not made for elephant hunting but as a military weapon .
The Commander - The Duke of Aosta - gave his personal collection of elephant guns to his Italian soldiers to shoot armored cars because they did n't have enough antitank guns .
The .700 Nitro Express -LRB- made in the 1980 's and 1990 's -RRB- and the new brass manufacturers made even more powerful elephant guns such as the .585 Nyati by Ross Seyfried , .577 Tyrannosaur by Colonel Art Alphin and .585 Gehringer by Karl Gehringer to be made by wildcatters .
These rifles came out in single shot , bolt action , and double rifle ways and was used until ivory hunting died off in the mid 20th century .

Like solar wind , the planetary wind is made up of light gases that have come out of planets ' atmospheres .
Sometimes gusts of wind can make poorly made bridges move or be destroyed , like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940 .
No species of tree can resist hurricane-force winds , but trees with roots that are not very deep can be blown over more easily . Trees such as eucalyptus , sea hibiscus , and avocado are brittle -LRB- easy to break -RRB- and are damanged more easily .
Wind is the flow of gases .
High winds can cause damage depending on how strong they are .
The strongest winds seen on a planet in our solar system are on Neptune and Saturn .
Power can go out because of wind , even if its speed is as low as sp = us 2 . This is because tree branches could change the flow of energy through power lines .
On Earth , wind is mostly the movement of air .
In outer space , solar wind is the movement of gases or particles from the sun through space .
The Christian themes are often melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in , regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter .
California 's Tourniquet and Australia 's Mortification led the movement in the 1990s .
Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and produced and distributed through various Christian networks .
Christian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelism to the wider heavy metal music scene , and was pioneered by the American Resurrection Band and Swedish Jerusalem .
Los Angeles ' Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s , otherwise the genre was mostly ignored by the mainstream .
` Christian metal ' , also known as ` white metal ' , is a form of heavy metal music music which a Christian band makes to praise Jesus Christ .
It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity , and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive alternative or counterbalance to secular metal music which is known for its generally dark and negative message .
The metalcore groups Underoath , Demon Hunter , As I Lay Dying , and Norma Jean -LRB- dubbed by Revolver Magazine as `` The Holy Alliance '' -RRB- brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 21st century , achieving ranks in the Billboard 200 .
Christian metal bands exist in all the subgenres of heavy metal music , and the only common link between most Christian metal bands are the lyrics .

Its width is about 80 % of the entire diameter of Vesta .
Temperatures on the surface have been thought to be between about -20 Â C with the Sun overhead , dropping to about -190 Â C at the winter pole .
However , it is possible that Vesta may be listed as a dwarf planet in the future , if it is convincingly determined that its shape is from hydrostatic equilibrium .
This gives an axial tilt of 29 Â .
After the discovery of Vesta in 1807 , no asteroids were discovered for the next 38 years .
The Vestoid asteroids and HED meteorites are examples .
4 Vesta is the second most massive asteroid in the solar system , with an average diameter of about 530 km -LRB- around 330 miles -RRB- and an estimated mass 9 % the mass of the entire asteroid belt .
Vesta was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers on March 29 , 1807 .
Vesta is the second-most massive body in the asteroid belt .
At that time , opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart .
Vesta was normally represented by a stylized hearth .
In fact , all the known V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6 % of the ejected volume , with the rest presumably either in small fragments , ejected by approaching the 3:1 Kirkwood gap , or perturbed away by radiation pressure .
The floor of this crater is about 13 km below , and its rim rises 4-12 km above the surrounding area , with total surface relief of about 25 km .
Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron-nickel core , above with a rocky olivine mantle , and a surface crust .
A dark feature about 200 km across has been named Olbers in honor of Vesta 's discoverer , but it does not appear in elevation maps as a fresh crater would , and its nature is presently unknown , perhaps an old basaltic surface .
Spectroscopic analyses of the Hubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers of the crust , and possibly into the mantle which is indicated by spectral signatures of olivine .
The spacecraft is the first able to enter and leave orbit around more than one body , thanks to its weight-efficient ion driven engines .
The first space mission to Vesta will be NASA 's Dawn probe , which will orbit the asteroid for nine months in 2010-2011 . The mission launched on September 27 , 2007 and will arrive at Vesta in the fall of 2010 .
From the first appearance of Ca-Al-rich inclusions -LRB- the first solid matter in the Solar System , forming about 4567 million years ago -RRB- , a likely timeline is as follows :
Its rotation is actually fast for an asteroid -LRB- 5.342 h -RRB- and prograde , with the north pole pointing in the direction of right ascension 20 h 32 min , declination +48 Â with an uncertainty of about 10 Â .
If this is the case , then the fact that 10 km fragments of the Vesta family have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is only about 1 billion years old or younger .
Vesta is the only known intact asteroid that has been resurfaced in this procedure .
For Vesta , there is a large collection of possible samples available to scientists , in the form of over 200 HED meteorites , giving insight into Vesta 's geologic history and structure .
Dawn will then proceed to its other target , Ceres and will probably continue to explore the asteroid belt on an extended mission using remaining fuel .
A central peak rises 18 km above the crater floor .
This estimate is for May 6 , 1996 , very close to perihelion , while details vary somewhat with the seasons .
It serves as a reference point with the 0 Â longitude prime meridian defined to pass through its center .
The eastern and western hemispheres show markedly different terrains .
Its size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid , and it is occasionally visible to the naked eye from dark -LRB- non-light polluted -RRB- skies .
Other symbols are and .
Even when in conjunction with the Sun , Vesta will have a magnitude around +8.5 ; thus from a pollution-free sky it can be observed with binoculars even at elongations much smaller than near opposition .
It is similar to 2 Pallas in volume -LRB- although it is not confirmed -RRB- , but somewhat more massive .
Because a number of meteorites are believed to be Vestian fragments , Vesta is currently one of only five identified Solar system bodies for which we have physical samples , the others being Mars , the Moon , comet Wild 2 , and Earth itself .
The most notable surface feature is a very large crater that is 460 km in diameter centered near the south pole .
Several other large craters about 150 km wide and 7 km deep are also present .
All are simplifications of the original .
On the other hand , large regions of the western hemisphere are taken up by dark geologic units thought to be surface basalts .
The V-type asteroid 1929 Kollaa has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites , indicating its origin deep within Vesta 's crust .
Some Vestian surface features have been resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope and ground based telescopes , e.g. the Keck Telescope .
Recently , in May and June 2007 , Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4 , the brightest since 1989 .
Various small solar system objects are believed to be fragments of Vesta caused by collisions .
He allowed the prominent mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to name the asteroid after the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth , Vesta .
Less favourable oppositions during late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere still have Vesta at a magnitude of around +7.0 .
However , the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories , which have since been broken by impacts .
It would also be the original site of origin of the HED meteorites .
It was visible in the constellations Ophiuchus and Scorpius .
It is thought that the impact responsible blew up about 1 % of the entire volume of Vesta , and it is likely that a group of smaller asteroids known as the Vesta family are the remains of this collision .
From preliminary spectral analyses of the Hubble Space Telescope images , the eastern hemisphere appears to be have a highly reflective , heavily cratered `` highland '' terrain with old , dusty rocks , and craters probing into deeper plutonic layers of the crust .
It is in the Inner Main Belt , at a distance of about 2.50 AU .

Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all types of gastrointestinal ailments .
But in Italy the biggest saffron cultivation , for quality and quantity , is in San Gavino Monreale , Sardinia .
During the 14th century Black Death , there was a huge increase in demand for saffron-based medicine . Much saffron had to be imported by Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes .

Ross Brann , a professor of Judeo-Islamic classes at Cornell University in Ithaca , stated that Wikipedia is without a way to expertly review , saying , `` They could make up your life if they wanted to . ''
Larry Sanger , editor-in-chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium , and a co-founder of Wikipedia who quit the project in 2002 , called Essjay 's response `` a defiant non-apology '' and elsewhere stated Essjay 's actions as `` identity fraud . ''
Talking about Jordan , Wales said , â Mr. Ryan was a friend , and still is a friend .
In it Schiff said that Essjay 's statement was `` complete nonsense . ''
Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email .
The New Yorker published a correction in February 2007 , which brought the issue to broader public attention .
When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007 , he made changes to his Wikia profile and `` came clean on who he really was , '' showing himself as Ryan Jordan .
Essjay said that he had sent an email to a college professor using his false persona 's credentials , telling for Wikipedia 's accuracy .
In his activities as an editor , Essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes .
Wales stated his regret that Essjay had `` made a series of very bad judgments . ''
Other Wikipedia editors asked Essjay questions on his Wikipedia talk page about the difference between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials .
Andrew Orlowski , a Wikipedia critic and writer for The Registerâ '' a British technology news and opinion websiteâ '' criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded ` Wikia ' and for making him a member on the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee . Essjay had admitted his stated academic and professional credentials were false before he was made a member .
In late February 2007 the magazine updated its article with a change -LRB- correction -RRB- saying that `` Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan , that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees , and that he has never taught . ''
In the message he wrote in part , `` I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia .
Orlowski added that Essjay 's actions showed a harmful community way of thinking inside Wikipedia .
I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation .
Essjay was pictured as taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz .
â Wales argued `` contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them . ''
On March 3 , 2007 , Andrew Lih , Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong , said on his blog that a part of Essjay 's comments on the incident entered `` the dangerous domain of defamation and libel '' against Stacy Schiff .
For instance , Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies , a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church .
I am also a tenured professor of theology ; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia userpage -LRB- linked below -RRB- to gain an idea of my background and credentials . ''
Following the media broadcast of the Essjay controversy , a number of people noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia .
`` Those will get looked at again . ''
Social activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then told `` The New Yorker '' about the difference in profiles .
However , Florence Devouard , chair of the Wikimedia Foundation , was not supportive of his credential suggestion , saying , `` I think what matters is the quality of the content , which we can improve by enforcing policies such as ` cite your source , ' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor . ''
Essjay posted a reason in response to the first question , saying that :
Brann also said that Wikipedia `` has no place in the University , '' and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the negative opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia .
He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished .
Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned `` that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes '' on Wikipedia .
Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur : `` This is a text I often require for my students , and I would hang my own Ph. D. on itâ s credibility . ''
He is a young man , and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology , which I have accepted .
Stacy Schiff , a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter writing for The New Yorker , interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia . -LRB- `` Know It All '' ; July 31 , 2006 -RRB- He was suggested for this to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation .
During the interview , Jordan told The New Yorker and had said on his Wikipedia user page that he had doctoral degrees in theology and canon law . He also said he worked as a tenured professor at a private university .
The New Yorker , said Essjay `` was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page . ''
It was later found that he was 24 years old and had quit community college with no qualifications .
While most editors opposed at least some of his actions , responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud .
Showing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages , Sanger stated that other members of Wikipedia management , including Angela Beesley -LRB- co-founder of Wikia and a member of Wikimedia Foundation 's Communications Committee -RRB- and Brad Patrick -LRB- legal counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation -RRB- had worked in hiring Jordan when they knew of the identity difference .
Others to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe . Ratcliffe asked `` why lying about one 's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia , which proposes to help communities to record accurate information '' and asked for additional details `` such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing , as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements . ''
Students at Cornell stated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information , though they would not cite it in scholarly work .
Sanger also made note that Jordan 's dismissal was the result of public response . That `` Only after these sad facts were publicly made aware , only after there was a response , did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjayâ s to quit . ''
Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales supported Essjay 's use of an identity , saying , `` I regard it as a pseudonym and I donâ t really have a problem with it . ''
Wales was '' ... reported to be considering vet all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes . ''
The article said that Essjay was on Wikipedia some 14 hours or more a day . The article also said he was careful to keep his online life a secret from his co-workers and friends .
He later said on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by `` doing a good job playing the part . ''
Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page : `` Further , she -LRB- Schiff -RRB- made several offers to compensate me for my time , and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so , she should donate to the Foundation instead . ''
On March 2 , 2007 , a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education commented `` the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia 's credibilityâ '' especially with professors who will now note that one of the site 's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud . ''
`` We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition , so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle '' , Wales commented .
Later Wales changed his opinion and asked for Essjay to quit from his jobs with Wikipedia and Wikia .
He said that he needed anonymity to avoid cyberstalking .
However , he also warned that â It 's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials , and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate .
`` People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments , '' said Michael Snow , a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper , The Wikipedia Signpost .
Many articles and comments were made electronic , print , and broadcast media ; the Wikipedia community checked Essjay 's article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project 's handling of personal identification .
`` I do n't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia , but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address , '' Wales added .
Reaction from inside the Wikipedia community to the Essjay\/Jordan identity difference was pointed .

Manure from hogs and cattle is spread on fields using a Manure spreader .
Manures improve the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and nutrients , such as nitrogen that is trapped by bacteria in the soil .
Due to the relatively lower level of proteins in grasses , which herbivores eat , cattle manure has a milder smell than the dung of carnivores -- for example , elephant dung is practically odorless .
Manure is organic matter used as fertilizer in agriculture .
Poultry droppings are harmful to plants when fresh but after a period of composting are valuable fertilizers .
The term `` manure '' was used for inorganic fertilizers in the past , but this usage is now very rare .
Green manures are crops grown for the express purpose of plowing them under . In so doing , fertility is increased through the nutrients and organic matter that are returned to the soil .

However , as Kwanzaa became more popular , Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included . He stated in the 1997 Kwanzaa : A Celebration of Family , Community , and Culture , `` Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday . ''

The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code .
In cryptography , RC5 is a simple symmetric-key block cipher .
The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits , a 128-bit key and 12 rounds .
Distributed.net has brute-forced RC5 messages encrypted with 56 - and 64-bit keys , and now is working on cracking a 72-bit key .
In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels ; RC5 has a variable block size -LRB- 32 , 64 or 128 bits -RRB- , variable key size -LRB- 0 to 2040 bits -RRB- and variable number of rounds -LRB- 0 to 255 -RRB- .
The key schedule , however , is more complex , expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of `` nothing up my sleeve numbers '' .
RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive OR -LRB- Xor -RRB- s. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like network .
`` RC '' stands for `` Rivest Cipher '' , or alternatively , `` Ron 's Code '' .
A number of these challenge problems have been tackled using distributed computing , organised by Distributed.net .
The simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive subject to study by cryptanalysts .
A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations ; one of the goals of RC5 was to study and evaluate operations of block ciphers as a cryptographic primitive .
RSA Security , which has a patent on the algorithm , offered a series of US$ 10,000 prizes for breaking ciphertexts encrypted with RC5 , but these contests have been discontinued as of May 2007 .
18 -- 20 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection .
12-round RC5 -LRB- with 64-bit blocks -RRB- is susceptible to a differential attack using 244 chosen plaintexts .

Eggplant parmigiana is the earliest version .
As with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese , the word Parmigiana is often rendered as `` Parmesan '' in English-speaking countries , from the French word for `` from Parma . ''
Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano , while others use softer melting cheeses like Mozzarella or Caciocavallo , or a combination of these .
There are several theories for the origin of the name parmigiana .
Other kinds made with breaded meat cutlets , such as veal and chicken parmigiana , are popular in other countries , usually in areas with a lot of Italian immigrants .
Examples of dishes developed outside of Italy from the early parmigianas include veal -LRB- Veal Parmigiana -RRB- or chicken breast -LRB- Chicken Parmigiana -RRB- dipped in beaten eggs , breaded , shallow-fried and topped with a marinara sauce -LRB- red Sicilian tomato sauce -RRB- and mozzarella .
Diced onions or green bell peppers , sautÃ ed or raw , are sometimes added .
The veal dish is known in Italian as Cotolette alla Bolognese .
It is based on melanzane alla parmigiana -LRB- alt .
Parmigiana is a Southern Italian dish made with a shallow-fried sliced filling , with cheese and tomato sauce on top , then baked .
In some kinds , the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and covered in flour or breadcrumbs before frying .
Chicken or veal parmigiana has become very popular in Australia as a pub dish , often served with chips and salad .
While `` parmigiana '' means `` from Parma '' -LRB- in Northern Italy -RRB- , the dish is not part of Parma food .
One common theory says the name is from Parmigiano-Reggiano -LRB- Parmesan cheese -RRB- .
This is an ancient Sicilian dish which , in all cookbooks , is erroneously stated as obtaining its name from Parmesan cheese , which is one of the ingredients .
parmigiana di melanzane -RRB- or eggplant parmigiana -LRB- or eggplant Parmesan -RRB- , a classic Southern Italian dish .
Parmigiana is also used as an adjective in the names of other unrelated dishes from Parma food , such as Trippa alla Parmigiana -LRB- Parma-style tripe -RRB- .
This dish is often referred to as a parma or parmi , a simple shortening of the name .
A similar dish , the Parmo , which uses either pork or chicken , has been made within the country of England .
In the United States and Canada , veal parmigiana or chicken parmigiana is commonly served as a grinder or a submarine sandwich .
It is then usually baked until the cheese is bubbly and brown .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The name `` parmigiana '' does not derive from that of the cheese but is the Italianization of the Sicilian dialectal word `` parmiciana '' , which refers to the slats of wood which compose the central part of a shutter and overlap in the same manner as the slices of eggplant in the dish . ''
The dish is claimed by both Campania and Sicily .
It may also contain a lot of toppings , including sliced ham or fried eggplant slices .
Along with the many Italian versions , different kinds of Parmigiana have been developed across the world , most often in countries where large numbers of Italians immigrated .

This ability to make macroscopic predictions based on microscopic properties is the main asset of statistical mechanics over thermodynamics .
Both theories are governed by the second law of thermodynamics through the medium of entropy .
However , entropy in thermodynamics can only be known empirically , whereas in statistical mechanics , it is a function of the distribution of the system on its micro-states .
It provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life , therefore explaining thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics and mechanics -LRB- classical and quantum -RRB- at the microscopic level .

The text on the tablets were not always curses , sometimes tablets wereused to help the dead .
Some tablets are inscribed with nothing more than the names of the targets . Some people think that an oral spell may have accompanied the making of the curse .
In Ancient Egypt , so-called `` Execration Texts '' appear around the time of the 12th Dynasty , listing the names of enemies written on clay figurines or pottery which were then smashed and buried beneath a building under construction -LRB- so that they were symbolically `` smothered '' -RRB- , or in a cemetery .
Those whose grave sites these were placed at usually died at a very young age or in a violent manner , and the tablet was supposed to help lay their souls to rest in spite of their untimely deaths .
About 130 curse tablets have been found at Aquae Sulis -LRB- now Bath in England -RRB- , where many of the curses related to thefts of clothes whilst the victim was bathing .
Those curse tablets targeted at thieves or other criminals may have been more public , more acceptable ; some scholars even refuse to use the word `` curse '' of such `` positive '' texts , preferring expressions such as `` judicial prayers '' .
Some texts do not invoke the gods , but merely list the targets of the curse , the crimes or conditions when the curse is valid , and\/or the intended ill to befall them .
A curse tablet or binding spell -LRB- defixio in Latin , Î Î Ï Î Î Î Ï Î 1\/4 Î Ï katadesmos in Greek -RRB- is a type of curse .
The texts on curse tablets are typically addressed to infernal or liminal gods such as Hermes , Charon , Hecate , and Persephone . Sometimes , a sometimes a dead person -LRB- probably the corpse in whose grave the tablet was placed -RRB- had to mediate .
Over 80 more have similarly been discovered in and about the remains of a temple to Mercury nearby , at West Hill , Uley , making south-western Britain one of the major centres for finds of Latin defixiones .
Others include erotic binding-spells , spells ranged against thieves , and business and sporting rivals .
The language of those texts that do give context is often concerned with justice , either listing the target 's crimes in great detail , handing over responsibility for their punishment to the gods , using indefinite grammar -LRB- `` whoever committed this crime '' -RRB- , or conditional -LRB- `` if he is guilty '' -RRB- , or even future conditional -LRB- `` if he ever breaks his word '' -RRB- . .
Many of those discovered at Athens refer to court cases and curse the opposing litigant , asking -LRB- `` May he ... '' -RRB- that he botch his performance in court , forget his words , become dizzy and so forth .

The term `` third parties '' is used in countries with first past the post electoral systems as these systems tend to create a two-party system because successful smaller parties are rare .
Some third parties also hope that the party can slowly build its support and eventually become one of the dominant parties , as the Labor Party did in Britain .
Despite this , there are many reasons for third parties to run .
A party generally needs to have a certain level of success to be called a third party .
Smaller parties that only win a small percentage of the vote and no seats in the legislature are often called minor parties or fringe parties .
While the term should be used only when discussing the third largest party , it is often used to describe any smaller party . For example , in the United Kingdom a third party is a national political party other than the Conservative Party and Labor Party that has a presence in the House of Commons .
In fact , coalitions between the smaller parties are normal in such a country .
In any two-party system of politics , a third party is a party other than the two main ones .
For example , in the United Kingdom a third party is a national political party other than the Conservative Party and Labor Party that has a presence in the House of Commons .
The larger parties must respond to these opinions , and sometimes the larger parties copy ideas from third parties .

The next step is beatification , at which point the person is referred to as The Blessed , and finally canonization , at which point the person is referred to as Saint .
The 7-8th-century English monk St. Bede was referred to as being venerable soon after his death and , by tradition , is therefore often referred to as `` the Venerable Bede '' despite his also having been canonized .
The Venerable is used as a style in several Christian churches .
St Bede was the first person to be recorded as The Venerable .
In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church , The Venerable , is the style used for a person who has been posthumously declared `` heroic in virtue '' during the investigation and process leading to possible canonization as a saint .
Before a person is considered to be venerable , he or she must be declared as such by a proclamation , approved by the Pope , of having lived a life that was `` heroic in virtue '' -- the virtues being the Theological Virtues of faith , hope , and charity and the Cardinal Virtues of prudence , justice , fortitude , and temperance .
Two modern and well-known examples of those who have been declared venerable are Popes John Paul II and Pius XII , who were both declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2009 , and who are likely to be beatified soon .

Obsidian is dark in color similar to rocks such as basalt .
Obsidian was valued in Stone Age cultures because , like flint , it could be fractured to produce hand axes , sharp blades or arrowheads .
Obsidian cores -LRB- unworked lumps -RRB- and blades were traded great distances inland from the coast .
It consists mainly of SiO2 -LRB- silicon dioxide -RRB- , usually 70 % or more .
Crystalline rocks with obsidian 's composition include granite and rhyolite .
Obsidan flows which you can hike on are found within the calderas of Newberry Volcano and Medicine Lake Volcano in the Cascade Range of western North America , and at Inyo Craters east of the Sierra Nevada in California .
Pre-Columbian Mesoamericans ' used obsidian a lot . It was carved and worked for tools and decorative objects .
Like all glass and flint , obsidian breaks with a characteristic shell-shaped fracture .
Because there is no crystal structure , obsidian blade edges can reach almost molecular thinness , leading to its ancient use as arrowheads , and its modern use as surgical scalpel blades .
Obsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a gemstone .
This breakdown of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water .
Obsidian is metastable at the earth 's surface : over time the glass becomes fine-grained crystals . So , no obsidian is older than Cretaceous age .
Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body .

Pure obsidian is usually dark in appearance , though the color varies depending on the presence of different materials .
Native American people traded obsidian throughout North America .

In this way , several great writers of Chinese composition of that time were followers of his school .
He has been described as the most influential Confucian scholar during the Tokugawa period .
Sorai studied the Zhu Xi version of Song Confucianism , and by 1690 he became a private teacher of Chinese classics .
In it he writes that literature is not so much intended for instruction in morality or governance , rather it simply allows human 's emotions to flow .
Sorai wrote many influential works where he showed what he thought were the two basic problems of the philosophy of Song Confucianism .
Sorai 's school saw Selections of Tang Poetry mainly as a means of accessing the Five Classics .
Master Sorai 's Teachings is a record of Sorai 's teaching and his exchanges with his students .
Sorai was a supporter of the samurai class .
Sorai had a large following with his teachings and created the Sorai school , which would become an influential force in Japanese Confucian scholarship .
He argued that allowing human emotions to express themselves was important . For this reason , he tried to strengthen the position that Chinese literature had in Japan .
In this he was highly influenced by the Ancient Rhetoric school of the Ming period . This movement saw the Qin and Han periods as the model for prose , and the Tang period as a model for poetry .
Sorai argued for the opposite , and wanted people to be enriched through music and poetry .
OgyÅ `` Sorai -LRB- March 21 , 1666 , Edo , Japan -- February 28 , 1728 , Edo -RRB- was a Japanese philosopher who used the pen name Butsu Sorai in many of his writings .
He argued , `` What possible value can there be for the common people to overreach their proper station in life and study such books -LRB- as the Confucian classics -RRB- ? ''
He taught that literature should be cared for , because it was an important part of human expression . As a result , Chinese writing began to thrive in Japan and became an accepted art form .
These provided for the Way , which was divided by rites -LRB- rei ç 1\/4 -RRB- and music -LRB- gaku æ 1\/2 -RRB- .
Sorai thought that study of philosophy began with the study of language .
Denial of these morals , he felt , would leave only `` rites and rules '' to be followed .
While most old institution decline because of leadership problems , the samurai , he felt , were best able to solve this problem with a system of rewards and punishment .
From this , answers to the former topics may be found .
Sorai consulted the ancient works to get more reliable knowledge . He stated that the ultimate form of scholarly knowledge was history .
Sorai is credited with the creation of kÅ shÅ gi , an unusual form of chess .
The rites gave social order and music gave inspiration for the heart .
One was that the Way was not a predetermined principle of the universe , but rather an establishment of men : the ancient sages had described it in the Confucianist classic works .
While Sorai sought to redefine the sources of Tokugawa legitimacy , his purpose was clearly to strengthen the authority of the Tokugawa shogunate .
He also saw that the Chinese sage kings were not only concerned with morality , but also with government itself .
Sorai was born the second son of a samurai -LRB- a warrior -RRB- who served as the personal physician of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi -LRB- å 3\/4 å ç å -RRB- . Tsunayoshi would become the fifth shogun .
He felt that these weaknesses were not weaknesses of Confucianism ; in his view , Song Confucianists interpreted the classic works of the Four Books and the Five Classics the wrong way . In Soraiu 's view , they did this because they `` did not know the old words '' .
He argued that solving the political crisis of the time required more than perfecting moral character .
As a result of this , Sorai 's school is also known as the Ancient Rhetoric -LRB- kobunji å æ -- è 3\/4 -RRB- school today .
Tsunayoshi died in 1709 . At that time Sorai stopped using the teachings of Zhu Xi and started to develop his own philosophy and school .
Sorai also saw problems with the merchant class at the time : he accused them of conspiring to lock prices .
Another scholar critical of Sorai 's teachings was Nakai Chikuzan , who was also familiar with Goi 's opposition to OgyÅ `` Sorai .
Goi wrote his opposition to Sorai in his essay Hi-Butsu hen . This essay was written in the 1730s , but not published until 1766 .
He also claimed individuals were able judge if external ideas and actions were true or just .
Sorai doubted that it was enough that each person wanted to find their ethical good .
Sorai would also accuse other Confucianists in Japan , such as Hayashi Razan , of relying too heavily on Song sources such as Zhu Xi .
He did not support the lower classes either , though .
Goi felt that Sorai 's teachings would cause a lot of damage to moral philosophy if they were followed .
The second point where Sorai disagreed with Song Confucianism was that he felt it was putting too much emphasis on morality and that it repressed human nature , because human nature was based on emotion .
Nakai later wrote his own , highly emotional , response to Sorai 's beliefs in his work Hi-Ch Å -LRB- 1785 -RRB- . In this work he rejected the idea that individuals could not improve themselves through moral choices .
The first was with the bakufu-domain system , which by the eighteenth century was in trouble .
Sorai rejected the moral ways of Song Confucianism and looked at the older works instead .
The Sorai school introduced in Selections of Tang Poetry to Japan , where it became very popular . This work is thought to have been edited by Li Panlong -LRB- æ æ '' ç `` 1514-70 -RRB- , who was a founder of the Ancient Rhetoric school .
Goi RanshÅ `` believed that Sorai was motivated to surpass ItÅ Jinsai , another leading Confucianist .
Some scholars criticised Sorai 's work and found his teaching was impractical .
The work was not released until 1724 , but it is thought to have actually been written around 1720 .
The text was edited by his own students and contained their questions followed by his answers .
In this it directly allowed for the flow of human emotions , something that the moralist philosophy of Song Confucianism did not agree with .
In 1696 , he started serving Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu , a senior councilor to Tsunayoshi .
It is used as a decoration during Halloween , and was named after the phenomenon of strange light flickering over peat bogs , called ignis fatuus or jack-o ' - lantern

The most important Dutch official in Dejima was called the Opperhoofd by the Dutch . The Japanese also called him Kapitan -LRB- from Portuguese capitÃ # o -RRB- .

If a send mix is configured pre-fader , then changes to the main channel strip fader does not affect the send mix .
`` Neptune '' , part of the orchestral suite , The Planets , by Gustav Holst , was an early piece of music to have a fade-out ending .
On a mixer with auxiliary send mixes , the send mixes are configured pre-fader or post-fader .
This is useful for stage monitor mixes where changes in the Front of House channel levels would distract the musicians .
Fading-out can serve as a recording solution for pieces of music that contain no obvious ending .
This is useful for reverberation and other signal processor effects .
A knob which rotates is usually not considered a fader , although it is electrically and functionally equivalent .
For instance , burning-software for the recording of audio-CDs .
Although commonplace today , the effect bewitched audiences in the era before widespread recorded soundâ '' after the initial 1918 run-through , Holst 's daughter , Imogen -LRB- in addition to watching the charwomen dancing in the aisles during `` Jupiter '' -RRB- remarked that the ending was `` unforgettable , with its hidden chorus of women 's voices growing fainter and fainter ... until the imagination knew no difference between sound and silence '' .
Though relatively rare , songs can fade out , then fade back in .
`` Goodbye Stranger '' by Supertramp takes about a minute to fade out .
This is extremely useful when beatmatching two phonograph records or compact discs .
The technique of ending a spoken or musical recording by fading out the sound goes back to the earliest days of recording .
A mix engineer will often record two or more takes of a vocal or instrumental part and create a final version which is a composite of the best passages of these takes by crossfading between each track .
No single recording can be reliably identified as `` the first '' to use the technique .
High-end mixers often have crossfade curve switches allowing the DJ to select the type of crossfade necessary .
Digital faders are also referred to as virtual faders , since they can be viewed on the screen of a digital audio workstation .
A crossfader on a dj mixer essentially functions like two faders connected side-by-side , but in opposite directions .
In 2003 , on the -LRB- now-defunct -RRB- website Stupid Question , John Ruch listed the following recordings as possible contenders :
Holst stipulates that the women 's choruses are `` to be placed in an adjoining room , the door of which is to be left open until the last bar of the piece , when it is to be slowly and silently closed '' , and that the final bar -LRB- scored for choruses alone -RRB- is `` to be repeated until the sound is lost in the distance '' .
It allows a DJ to fade one source out while fading another source in at the same time .
Many DJ equipment manufacturers offer different mixers for different purposes -LRB- e.g. scratching , beatmixing , cut mixing , etc. -RRB- .
In the perfect case the crossfader would keep constant output level .
For example , the songs `` Bitter Sweet Symphony '' by The Verve and `` Turn to Stone '' by Electric Light Orchestra fade in from the beginning , while the songs `` Born to Be Wild '' by Steppenwolf , `` Boogie Oogie Oogie '' by A Taste of Honey , and `` Hey Jude '' by The Beatles fade out .
There are many software applications that feature virtual crossfaders .
With the advent of electrical recording , smooth and controllable fadeout effects could be easily achieved by simply reducing the input volume from the microphones using the fader on the mixing desk .
In audio engineering , a fade is a gradual increase -LRB- fade-in -RRB- or decrease -LRB- fade-out -RRB- in the level of an audio signal .
The term can also be used for film cinematography or theater lighting , in much the same way -LRB- see : fade -LRB- filmmaking -RRB- -RRB- .
However , there 's no standard how this should be achieved .
A fader can be either analog , directly controlling the resistance or impedance to the source -LRB- e.g. a Potentiometer -RRB- ; or digital , numerically controlling a digital signal processor -LRB- DSP -RRB- .
If a send mix is configured post-fader , then the level sent to the send mix follows changes to the main channel strip fader .
Some examples of this are `` Helter Skelter '' by The Beatles , `` Suspicious Minds '' by Elvis Presley , `` Thank You '' by Led Zeppelin or `` Undercover of the Night '' by The Rolling Stones .
Experienced DJs are also able to crossfade between tracks using the channel faders .
In the era of mechanical -LRB- pre-electrical -RRB- recording , this could only be achieved by either moving the sound source away from the recording horn , or by gradually reducing the volume at which the performer\/s were singing , playing or speaking .
A recorded song may be gradually reduced to silence at its end -LRB- fade-out -RRB- , or may gradually increase from silence at the beginning -LRB- fade-in -RRB- .
A fader is any device used for fading , especially when it is a knob or button that slides along a track or slot .
However , `` Born to be Wild '' and `` Boogie Oogie Oogie '' fade out in a matter of seconds , whereas `` Hey Jude '' takes over 2 minutes to completely fade out .
The term fade is also used in multi-speaker audio systems to describe the balancing of power between front and rear channels .
The technique of crossfading is also used in audio engineering as a mixing technique , particularly with instrumental solos .
Modern high end digital mixers often have piezo-electric actuators attached to the faders such that they can be multi-use and will jump to the correct position for the selected function and\/or saved setting .

This marks the end of the Sun 's main sequence lifetime , and thereafter it will be into a red giant .
This has caused a widespread , ongoing extinction of other species known as the Holocene extinction .
In three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33 % more luminous .
This occurs in the core region of the star .
Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core , until the increase in luminosity reaches 121 % of the present value .
As part of the supercontinent cycle , plate tectonics may create a supercontinent within 250 millionâ `` 350 million years .
The energy generation of the Sun is based upon changing of hydrogen into helium .
Humans now play a top role in the biosphere , with the large amount of people in many of Earth 's ecosystems .
The most likely fate of the planet is being destroyed by the Sun in about 7.5 billion years , after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded to cross the planet 's orbit .
Four billion years from now , the increase in the Earth 's surface temperature will cause a bad greenhouse effect .
The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction , the large distribution of invasive species , hunting and climate change .
The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present , increasing by 1 % every 110 million years .
Some time in the next 1.5 billionâ `` 4.5 billion years , the axis 's tilt may begin to change into bad versions , with changes in the axis 's tilt of up to 90 Â .
When the Sun first became a main sequence star , it radiated only 70 % of the current luminosity .
The future of the Earth will depend on many things , including increases in the brightness of the Sun , loss of heat energy from the Earth 's core and change of the planet 's orbit by the other things in the Solar System .
The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be limited in 4.8 billion years , when the Sun will be 67 % more luminous than at present .
One billion to two billion years in the future , the increase in solar radiation caused by the helium build-up at the core of the Sun will result in the loss of the oceans and the cessation of continental drift .
The Milankovitch theory says the planet will continue to go into glaciation cycles because of the planet 's difference in orbit from a perfect circle , the axis of the planet tilting , and pushing of the Earth 's orbit .

The `` edge '' of the outflow boundary can often be detected by weather radar .
Convergence occurs along the leading edge of the downdraft .
Outflow is a term for the air that flows away from a thunderstorm .
The image to the right depicts a particularly strong ouflow boundary ahead of a line of storms .
This density boundary will increase the number of echo returns from the leading edge .
The signature of the leading edge is also influenced by the density change between the cold air from the downdraft and the warm environmental air .
Often , the outflow boundary will bow in the direction it is moving the quickest .
Clouds , hydrometeors and new thunderstorms can also develop along the outflow 's leading edge .
This makes it possible to locate the outflow boundary when using precipitation mode .
Convergence of dust , aerosols , and bugs at the leading edge will lead to a higher clear air signature .

The first part consists of fifteen chapters , covering the Roman Catholic clericalism from the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century in Austria-Hungary , then in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia .
Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac is portrayed in this book as an ardent Roman Catholic crusader who publicly endorsed the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia , , acknowledged the Ustashe as Croatian patriots , defended her before the Roman Pope and was responsible for the racist attitude and behavior of his clergy .
The earliest surveys of this book are the ones of Russian S. Troicky -LRB- as of the 1949 year - see the link -RRB- and of Swede O. Neumann .
Observing the Roman Catholic Church activities in Yugoslavia for more than fifty years , the author concludes that this Church replaced the idea of service to God by service to the Roman Curia , i.e. service to the government of the Roman Pontificate in the role of the world leader .
The abridged edition of this book published in 1960 is reviewed in the Istorijski glasnik and the same review echoed in the Historical abstracts .
Neumann stressed three things particular to this book : the role of V. Novak in spreading and defending the idea of Yugoslavism , abundance of the documentation used to support the book content , and that `` Some passages have been written by a scholar in a dignified academic gown , in other parts of the book the author assumes the role of public prosecutor .

The book describes activities of the Roman Catholic clergy in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , including their intention and attempts to become above the state , to control the state and eventually everyday lives of the common people .
The second part , the last four chapters , covers the rise and fall of the Independent State of Croatia , and the active support of the Roman Catholic Church clergy .
`` Magnum crimen : pola vijeka klerikalizma u Hrvatskoj '' -LRB- i.e. Major accusation : Half a century of clericalism in Croatia -RRB- is a book first published in Zagreb in 1948 .

The book has six full editions and one abridged .
The main doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was that -LRB- a -RRB- the clergy shall be paid by the state as the state officials ; -LRB- b -RRB- the state can not have any control over the Church ; -LRB- c -RRB- the Church has right to be fully involved in the political life of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ; -LRB- d -RRB- the Church doctrine\/religious education shall be a part of primary and secondary school curricula ; and that -LRB- e -RRB- the Roman Catholic Church curricula in the schools shall be obligatory to all pupils whose at least one parent is a Roman Catholic .
The second part of this book is about the beginning of the Independent State of Croatia , the active support of the Roman Catholic clergy to this state , and their involvement and support in the extermination and\/or forceful conversion of the Serbs and extermination of the Jews and the Roma people .
Josip Juraj Strossmayer 's ideas , of which the most important one was - serving God equals to serving people , created close relations between Croats and Serbs by introducing the Old Slavonic language as the liturgy language of the Roman Catholic Church in the Balkans - were aggressively suppressed by the Roman Catholic clergy in Croatia and Slovenia .

The Giant 's Causeway is an area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns , the result of an ancient volcanic eruption .
It is located in County Antrim on the northeast coast of Northern Ireland .
The tallest are about 12 metres -LRB- 36 ft -RRB- high , and the solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 metres thick in places .
Some 50 to 60 million years ago , during the Paleogene period , Antrim was subject to intense volcanic activity , when highly fluid molten basalt intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive lava plateau .
In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers , the Giant 's Causeway was named as the fourth greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom .
As the lava cooled rapidly , contraction occurred .
The size of the columns is primarily determined by the speed at which lava from a volcanic eruption cools .
The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns seen today .
It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 , and a National Nature Reserve in 1987 by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland .

On his homepage , Gerber describes Trotter as an unpleasant character who `` drinks too much , eats like a pig , sleeps until noon , and owes everybody money . ''
It now falls upon Harry to find and destroy Voldemort 's remaining Horcruxes and to avenge Dumbledore 's death .
She explained that this image simply came to her when she first thought up Harry Potter , seeing him as a `` scrawny , black-haired , bespectacled boy '' .
Throughout the series , Rowling wrote Harry Potter as a gifted wizard apprentice .
For Rowling , this scene is important because it shows how Harry is brave , and by finding Cedric 's corpse , he demonstrates selflessness and compassion .
Harry learns that his parents were sold out to Lord Voldemort by their friend Peter Pettigrew , also accused of framing Harry 's godfather Sirius Black for crimes he did n't make , locking him up in the wizarding prison , Azkaban .
This inexperience with romance was a factor in Harry 's failed relationship with Cho Chang .
Harry first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone -LRB- published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone -RRB- as the book 's protagonist , or main character .
According to author J. K. Rowling , Harry Potter is strongly guided by his own conscience , and has a keen feeling of what is right and what is wrong .
When Death Eaters invade Hogwarts , Snape kills Dumbledore .
In Chapter 33 -LRB- `` The Prince 's Tale '' -RRB- Snape 's memories show that he loved Harry 's mother Lily Evans , but their friendship ended over his association with future Death Eaters and `` blood purity '' beliefs .
Rowling says she put Harry through extreme emotional stress to show his emotional vulnerability and humanity -- a contrast to his nemesis , Voldemort . ''
The spirits shortly protect Harry as he escapes to Hogwarts with Cedric 's body .
As Snape escapes , he proclaims that he is the Half-Blood Prince -- Harry 's admired mentor is actually his hated enemy .
A new character appears when former Hogwarts Potions master Horace Slughorn returns to replace Severus Snape , who takes over the Defense Against the Dark Arts post .

When Hedwig is killed in the seventh book , the author said she expected the strong emotional reaction of her readers : `` The loss of Hedwig represented a loss of innocence and security .
Harry comes to recognize that his own single-mindedness makes him predictable to his enemies and often clouds his perceptions .
Rowling has said that creating the story about Harry Potter 's past was a matter of reverse planning : `` The basic idea -LRB- is that -RRB- Harry â did n't know he was a wizard â and so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be , that he would n't know what he wasâ When he was one-year-old , the most evil wizard in hundreds of years attempted to kill him .
A sideplot of Order of the Phoenix involves Harry 's romance with Cho Chang , but the relationship quickly unravels .
Rowling stated : `` And now he -LRB- Harry -RRB- will rise from the ashes strengthened . ''
According to Rowling , one of Harry 's pivotal scenes came in the fourth book when he protects his dead schoolmate Cedric Diggory 's body from arch villain Lord Voldemort , because it shows he is brave and unselfish .
In the books , Harry is categorised as a `` half-blood '' wizard in the series , because although both his parents were magical , his mother , Lily Evans , was `` Muggle-born '' .
However , after her mother 's death , Rowling wrote Harry as a child longing to see his dead parents again , incorporating her own anguish into him .
As a result , Harry 's growing angry and erratic behavior nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione .
Dumbledore , who was dying from a slow-spreading curse , wanted to protect Snape 's position within the Death Eaters and spare Draco Malfoy from completing Voldemort 's task to murder him .
Rowling said in the same interview that until about halfway through the third book , his good friend Hermione Granger â `` written as the smartest student in Harry 's yearâ `` would have beaten Harry in a magical duel .
Her favorite funny scene is when Harry accidentally sets a boa constrictor free from the zoo in the horrified Dursleys ' presence .
He 's competitive , and he 's a fighter .
He goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magic .
Harry is able to speak and understand Parseltongue , a language associated with Dark Magic , which , according to Rowling , is because he harbors a piece of Lord Voldemort 's soul .
From the fourth book onwards , Rowling admits Harry has become quite talented in the Defense Against the Dark Arts and would beat his friend Hermione in a magical duel .
Radcliffe stated that the most oft repeated question he has been asked is how Harry Potter has influenced his own life , to which he regularly answers it has been `` fine '' , and that he did not feel pigeonholed by the role , but rather sees it as a huge privilege to portray the character of Harry Potter .
So he 's left with this lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead , and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard who has been in hiding ever since '' .
So that â `` Phoenix was the point at which I decided he would have his breakdown . ''
She felt an orphan would be the most interesting character to write about .
When Harry duels Voldemort , their wands ' magical streams connect , forcing the spirit echoes of Voldemort 's victims , including Cedric and James and Lily Potter , to be expelled from his wand .
And heâ s after revenge -LRB- against Voldemort and Snape -RRB- . ''
Both feuds continue throughout the series .
In addition , Harry Potter is spoofed in the Barry Trotter series by American writer Michael Gerber , where a `` Barry Trotter '' appears as the eponymous anti-hero .
Says Rowling : `` They were never going to be happy , it was better that it ended early ! ''
Because of this , Radcliffe talked to a bereavement counsellor to help him prepare for the role .
Throughout the entire series , Harry sports his father 's perpetually untidy black hair , his mother 's green eyes , and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead because of his encounter with Lord Voldemort and round , thick eyeglasses .
However , she explains that , `` He is also in an extreme situation and attempting to defend somebody very good against a violent and murderous opponent '' .
The book contains many handwritten notes , revisions , and new spells ; Hermione , however , believes Harry using it is cheating .
To rescue her , Harry battles Riddle and the monster he controls that is hidden in the Chamber of Secrets .
In the previous books , Harry is written as a child , but Rowling states that in the fourth novel , Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , `` Harry 's horizons are literally and metaphorically widening as he grows older . ''
Heâ s now ready to go out fighting .
In the sixth book , Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry enters a tumultuous puberty that , Rowling says , is based on her and her younger sister 's own difficult teenage years .
According to halloweenonline.com , Harry Potter sets were the fifth-best selling Halloween costume of 2005 .
The movement started in Massachusetts with the band Harry and the Potters , who cosplay as Harry during live performances
In the next chapter , `` The Flaw in the Plan '' , it is established that Harry , not Voldemort , became the Elder Wand 's true master .
-LRB- Harry is -RRB- a very human hero , and this is , obviously , a contrast , between him , as a very human hero , and Voldemort , who has deliberately dehumanised himself .
To defeat Harry , Voldemort steals the Elder Wand from Dumbledore 's tomb . It is the most powerful wand ever created , and he twice casts the Killing Curse on Harry with it .
The author stated '' -LRB- s -RRB- ince I really liked Rowling 's books -LRB- â -RRB- I felt obligated to try to write a spoof worthy of the originals . ''
When Severus Snape is killed by Voldemort later in the story , Harry realizes that Snape was not the traitorous murderer he believed him to be , but a tragic anti-hero who was loyal to Albus Dumbledore .
Rowling also decided to make Harry an orphan at a boarding school called Hogwarts .
According to J.K. Rowling , a telling scene in which Harry uses Cruciatus and Imperius -LRB- unforgivable curses for torture and mind-control -RRB- on Voldemort 's servants shows a side to Harry that is `` flawed and mortal . ''
J.K. Rowling said that in the hours she waited , her idea for `` this scrawny , black-haired , bespectacled boy who did n't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me . ''
On his eleventh birthday , Harry finds that he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid tells him that he is to go Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .
She stated in a 2000 interview with South West News Service that Harry Potter is `` particularly talented '' in Defense Against the Dark Arts , and also good in Quidditch .
He `` does make mistakes '' , she conceded , but in the end , he does what his conscience tells him to do .
He killed Harry 's parents , and then he tried to kill Harry - he tried to curse himâ Harry has to find out , before we find out .
In a 2007 interview with MTV , Radcliffe stated that , for him , Harry Potter is a classic coming of age character : `` That 's what the films are about for me : a loss of innocence , going from being a young kid in awe of the world around him , to someone who is more battle-hardened by the end of it . ''
Wizard rock is a musical movement dating from 2002 that consists of at least 200 bands made up of young musicians , playing songs about Harry Potter .
Rowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children .
She has been almost like a cuddly toy to Harry at times .
Voldemort 's second Killing Curse also fails because Voldemort used Harry 's blood in his resurrection . Voldemort 's soul shard within Harry was destroyed because Harry willingly faced death .
I know that death upset a lot of people ! ''
It is actually an elaborate scheme by Lord Voldemort to lure Harry into a deadly trap .
In the second book , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , Rowling pits Harry against Tom Marvolo Riddle , a memory of Lord Voldemort locked up in a secret diary that Ron 's younger sister Ginny Weasley finds in a bathroom .
When Voldemort killed the Potters , a grieving Snape vowed to protect Lily 's child , although he loathed young Harry for being James Potter 's son .
After the seventh book , Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength , being able to do what even Voldemort can not : he is not afraid of death .
It is also revealed that Snape did not kill Albus Dumbledore , but carried out Dumbledore 's prearranged plan .
Harry 's developing maturity becomes apparent when he becomes interested in Cho Chang , a pretty Ravenclaw student .
Harry `` is very glad '' to have lost this gift .
However , she says , Harry is not directly based on any real-life character , `` he came just out of a part of me '' .
Radcliffe was quoted as saying that he wished for Harry to die in the books , but he clarified that he , `` ca n't imagine any other way they can be concluded '' .
A new character is introduced when the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the latest Hogwarts ' Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor -LRB- and Ministry spy -RRB- .
`` The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero , many of whom you would never meet -LRB- â -RRB- if people like Harry and identify with him , I am pleased , because I think he is very likeable . ''
The first attempt merely stuns Harry into a death-like state .
Now his thoughts concern Ginny Weasley , Ron 's sister , a vital plot point in the last chapter when Harry ends their budding romance to protect her from Voldemort .
Says Rowling , `` He wants to save Cedric 's parents additional pain .
According to Rowling , Harry 's favorite book is Quidditch Through the Ages , an actual book that Rowling wrote -LRB- under the pseudonym Kennilworthy Whisp -RRB- for the Comic Relief charity .
â She added that preventing Cedric Diggory 's body from falling into Voldemort 's hands is based on the classic scene in the Iliad where Achilles finds the body of his best friend Patroclus from the hands of Hector .
He also forms rivalries with characters Draco Malfoy , a classmate from an elitist wizard family , and the Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House , Severus Snape .
The books cover seven years in the life of the orphan who , on his 11th birthday , learns he is a wizard and the son of magical parents Lily and James Potter .
As of 2007 , he has an estimated wealth of Â # 17 million .
He 's a normal boy but with those qualities most of us really admire . ''
He does n't just lie down and take abuse .
In the novels , Harry is the only child of James and Lily Potter , but orphaned as an infant .
In addition , wizard rock bands like Harry and the Potters and others regularly dress up in the style of Harry Potter , sporting painted forehead scars , black wigs and round bottle top glasses .
The death of her mother on December 30 , 1990 led Rowling to write Harry Potter as a boy longing for his dead parents . His pain became `` more deeper , more real '' than in earlier versions because she related to it herself .
Rowling also said that Harry 's two worst character flaws are `` anger and occasional arrogance '' , but that Harry is also innately honorable .
Tension mounts , however , when Harry is mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament , even though another Hogwarts champion , Cedric Diggory , was already selected .
According to Rowling , to characters for whom wizarding blood purity matters , Lily would be considered `` as loathsome as a Muggle '' , and derogatively referred to as a `` Mudblood '' .
Then there 's the security .
There he learns about his parents and his connection to the Dark Lord .
Radcliffe was asked to audition for the role of Harry Potter in 2000 by producer David Heyman , while in at a play titled Stones in His Pockets in London .
He also said that for him , important factors in Harry 's psyche are his survivor 's guilt in regard to his dead parents and his lingering loneliness .
Harry also takes the Elder Wand and lays it with Dumbledore 's body , so the power of the wand might be extinguished if he dies a natural death . However , the new portrait of Dumbledore in the Headmaster 's Office agrees that Harry should keep the Invisibility Cloak for himself , since it was his father 's .
In the chapter `` King 's Cross '' , Dumbledore 's spirit tells Harry that when Voldemort failed to kill baby Harry and disembodied himself , Harry became an unintentional Horcrux ; Voldemort could not kill Harry while the Dark Lord 's soul shard was within Harry 's body .
Harry excels in Potions by using an old textbook once belonging to a talented student known only as , `` The Half-Blood Prince . ''
But he does have native integrity , which makes him a hero to me .
In the fifth book , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore , disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned .
And he didnâ t want to lose anything else .
After reading the last book , where Harry Potter and his friends survive and have children , Radcliffe stated to be glad about the ending and lauded author J. K. Rowling for the conclusion of the story .
She gradually gains more power , eventually seizing control of the school .
Harry James Potter is the main character and the main protagonist of J. K. Rowling 's Harry Potter fantasy series .
In the third book , called Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , Rowling uses time travel as the basis for the book .
`` The real master of Death accepts that he must die , and that there are much worse things in the world of the living . ''
His power is evident from the beginning of the series ; specifically , Harry shows immediate command of a broomstick , produces a Patronus at an early age and survives several confrontations with Voldemort .
Rowling made Harry an orphan from the early drafts of her first book .
When Black escapes to find revenge , Harry and Hermione use a Time Turner to save him and a hippogriff named Buckbeak .
Rowling also made an intimate statement about Harry 's personal life : `` Because of the demands of the adventure that Harry is following , he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had '' .
In a 1999 interview , Rowling stated that Draco is based on several schoolyard bullies she had known and Snape on a teacher of hers who abused his power .
Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security , and that 's what Hogwarts offers Harry . ''
According to author J. K. Rowling , the idea for both the Harry Potter books and the character came while waiting for a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990 .
He is sorted into Gryffindor House by the Sorting Hat and becomes friends with classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger . Near the end of his first year at Hogwarts , he stops Voldemort 's attempt to steal the Philosopher 's Stone .
Having `` very limited access to truly caring adults '' , Rowling said , Harry `` is forced to make his own decisions from early age on . ''
Through private meetings with Dumbledore , Harry learns about Lord Voldemort 's orphaned youth , his rise to power , and how he splintered his soul into Horcruxes to achieve immortality .
`` He 's not a cruel boy .
Harry suffers another emotional blow , when his godfather , Sirius Black is killed during a battle with Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries , but Harry ultimately defeats Voldemort 's plan to steal an important prophecy and helps uncover Umbridge 's sinister motives .
J.K. Rowling said , the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry willingly accepts mortality , making him stronger than his nemesis .
And Harry , therefore , did have to reach a point where he did almost break down , and say he didnâ t want to play anymore , he didnâ t want to be the hero anymore â `` and heâ d lost too much .
In a 2000 interview with The Guardian , Rowling also said that the character of Wart in T.H. White 's novel The Sword In the Stone is `` Harry 's spiritual ancestor . ''
In the six Harry Potter movies from 2001-2009 , Harry Potter has been played by British actor Daniel Radcliffe .
Two Horcruxes have been destroyed , and Harry and Dumbledore locate another , although it is a fake .
And - so - but for some mysterious reason , the curse did n't work on Harry .

Behn 's story was adapted for the stage by Irish playwright Thomas Southerne , who stressed its sentimental aspects , and as time went on it came to be seen as addressing the issues of slavery and colonialism , remaining very popular throughout the Eighteenth Century .
Even the Biblical David the shepherd boy , falls into this category .
\/ To be , contents his natural desire ; \/ He asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire : \/ But thinks , admitted to that equal sky , \/ His faithful dog shall bear him company .
Behn 's story was not primarily a protest against slavery but was written for money ; and it met readers ' expectations by following the conventions of the European romance novella .
Such people , in quality of soldiers , must be invincible ...
Likewise , the idea that withdrawal from society -- and specifically from cities -- is associated with virtue , is originally a religious one .
Purely through the use of his reason , Hayy goes through all the gradations of knowledge before emerging into human society , where he revealed to be a believer of Natural religion , which Cotton Mather , as a Christian Divine , identified with Primitive Christianity .
In antiquity this form of `` hard Primitivism '' , whether viewed as desirable or seen as something to escape , co-existed in rhetorical opposition to the `` soft Primitivism '' of visions of a lost Golden Age of ease and plenty .
European guilt over colonialism , with its use of recently invented guns on people who did not have them inspired fictional treatments such as Aphra Behn 's novel Oroonoko , or the Royal Slave , about a slave revolt in Surinam in the West Indies .
The Germans did not inhabit a `` Golden Age '' of ease , but were tough and inured to hardship , qualities which Tacitus saw as preferable to the `` softness '' of civilized life .
Hayy ibn Yaqdhan an Islamic philosophical tale -LRB- or thought experiment -RRB- by Ibn Tufail from twelfth-century Andalusia , straddles the divide between the religious and the secular .
He had always existed , from the time of the epic of Gilgamesh , where he appears as Enkiddu , the wild-but-good man who lives with animals ; and the untutored-but-noble medieval knight , Parsifal .
He is not a savage but dresses and behaves like a European aristocrat .
The tale is of interest because it was known to the New England Puritan divine , Cotton Mather .
In English , the phrase Noble Savage first appeared in Dryden 's play , The Conquest of Granada -LRB- 1672 -RRB- : `` I am as free as nature first made man , \/ Ere the base laws of servitude began , \/ When wild in woods the noble savage ran . ''
In the first century CE , all of these qualities had been attributed by Tacitus to the German barbarians in his Germania , in which he contrasted them repeatedly with the softened , Romanized , corrupted Gauls , by inference criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its roots -- which was the perennial function of such comparisons .
whose untutor 'd mind \/ Sees God in clouds , or hears him in the wind ; \/ His soul proud Science never taught to stray \/ Far as the solar walk or milky way ; \/ Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv ` n , \/ Behind the cloud-topp 'd hill , a humbler heav ` n ; \/ Some safer world in depth of woods embrac 'd , \/ Some happier island in the wat ` ry waste , \/ Where slaves once more their native land behold , \/ No fiends torment , no Christians thirst for gold !
The idealized picture of `` Nature 's Gentleman '' was an aspect of eighteenth-century sentimentalism , along with other stock figures such as , the Virtuous Milkmaid , the Servant-More-Clever-than-the-Master -LRB- such as Sancho Panza and Figaro , among countless others -RRB- , and the general theme of virtue in the lowly born .
Translated in to English -LRB- from Latin -RRB- in 1686 and 1708 , it tells the story of Hayy , a wild child , raised by a gazelle , without human contact , on a deserted island in the Indian Ocean .
Nature 's Gentleman , whether European-born or exotic , takes his place among these tropes , along with the Wise Egyptian , Persian , and Chinaman .
The locus classicus of the eighteenth century portrayal of the American Indian is that of Alexander Pope , unquestionably the most famous and widely-translated poet of his day . In his philosophical poem , `` Essay on Man '' -LRB- 1734 -RRB- , Pope wrote : Lo , the poor Indian !
The leader of the revolt , Oroonoko , is truly noble in that he is a hereditary African prince , and he laments his lost African homeland in the traditional terms of a Golden Age .
The figure of Hayy is both a Natural man and a Wise Persian , but not a Noble Savage .
They greatly excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility ; they are incredibly abstemious , and patient of hunger and fatigue ; so steeled against the weather , that in traveling , even when the ground is covered with snow , they never look for a house , or any other shelter but their plaid , in which they wrap themselves up , and go to sleep under the cope of heaven .

The Sassanid era is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran . In many ways the Sassanid period saw the highest achievement of Persian civilization , and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the Muslim conquest and adoption of Islam .
Their cultural influence extended far beyond the empire 's territorial borders , reaching as far as Western Europe , Africa , China and India , and played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art .

YesÃ 1\/4 khei 's clan was called Borjigin -LRB- Ð ` Ð 3\/4 Ñ Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð 1\/2 -RRB- , and Hoelun was from the Olkhunut , the sub-lineage of the Onggirat tribe .
According to the Secret History , TemÃ 1\/4 jin was named after a Tatar chieftain whom his father had just captured .
Genghis Khan 's grandson , Kublai Khan , was the first ever emperor of the Yuan Dynasty -LRB- 1271 â `` 1368 -RRB- in China .
No accurate portraits of Genghis exist today , and any surviving depictions are considered to be artistic interpretations .
The Secret History of the Mongols reports that TemÃ 1\/4 jin was born with a blood clot grasped in his fist , a sign that he was destined to become a great leader .
Rashid al-Din also described the first meeting of Genghis and Kublai Khan , when Genghis was shocked to find that Kublai had not inherited his red hair .
Because of the lack of records , there is very little information about the early life of TemÃ 1\/4 jin .
Persian historian Rashid-al-Din recorded in his `` Chronicles '' that the legendary `` glittering '' ancestor of Genghis was tall , long-bearded , red-haired , and green-eyed .
When the Tatars grew too powerful after 1161 , the Jin switched their support from the Tatars to the Keraits .
The few sources that provide insight into this period often conflict .
Because his father was a chieftain , as were the ones before him , TemÃ 1\/4 jin was of a noble background .
TemÃ 1\/4 jin was related on his father 's side to Khabul Khan , Ambaghai and Qutula Khan who had headed the Mongol confederation .
The name also suggests that they may have been descended from a family of blacksmiths -LRB- see section Name and title below -RRB- .
Controversies aside , the closest depiction generally accepted by most historians is the portrait currently in the National Palace Museum in Taipei , Taiwan -LRB- see picture above -RRB- .
He was the third-oldest son of his father YesÃ 1\/4 khei , a minor tribal chief of the Kiyad and an ally of Ong Khan of the Kerait tribe , and the oldest son of his mother Hoelun .
Like other tribes , they were nomads .
When the Chinese Jin Dynasty switched support from the Mongols to the Tatars in 1161 , they destroyed Khabul Khan .
Modern historian Paul Ratchnevsky has suggested in his Genghis biography that the `` glittering man '' may have been from the Kyrgyz people , who historically displayed these same characteristics .
Genghis 's father , YesÃ 1\/4 gei -LRB- leader of the Borjigin and nephew to Ambaghai and Qutula Khan -RRB- , emerged as the head of the ruling clan of the Mongols , but this position was contested by the rival Tayichiâ ud clan , who descended directly from Ambaghai .
Also according to al-Din Genghis 's Borjigid clan , had a legend involving their origins : it began as the result of an affair between Alan-ko and a stranger to her land , a glittering man who happened to have red hair and bluish-green eyes .
TemÃ 1\/4 jin was born in 1162 in a Mongol tribe near Burkhan Khaldun mountain and the Onon and Kherlen Rivers in modern-day Mongolia , not far from the current capital Ulaanbaatar .
The Etruscan language was spoken and written by the Etruscan civilization in the ancient area of Etruria -LRB- modern Tuscany plus western Umbria and northern Latium -RRB- and in parts of Lombardy , Veneto , and Emilia-Romagna -LRB- where Gauls took the place of Etruscans -RRB- , in Italy .
Inscriptions have been found in north-west and west-central Italy , in the region that even now has a name that came from the Etruscans , Tuscany -LRB- from Latin tuscÄ `` `` Etruscans '' -RRB- , as well as in today 's Latium north of Rome , in today 's Umbria west of the Tiber , around Capua in Campania and in the Po valley to the north of Etruria .

In an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack , the attacker makes their ciphertext choices adaptively , that is , depending on the result of prior decryptions .
A specially noted variant of the chosen-ciphertext attack is the `` lunchtime '' or `` midnight '' attack , in which an attacker may make adaptive chosen-ciphertext queries but only up until a certain point , after which the attacker must demonstrate some improved ability to attack the system .
This is a stronger attack notion than the lunchtime attack , and is commonly referred to as a CCA2 attack , as compared to a CCA1 -LRB- lunchtime -RRB- attack .
In a non-adaptive attack , the attacker chooses the ciphertext or ciphertexts to decrypt in advance , and does not use the resulting plaintexts to inform their choice for more ciphertexts .
When a cryptosystem is susceptible to chosen-ciphertext attack , implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an attackers might be able to decrypt chosen ciphertexts -LRB- i.e. , avoid providing a decryption scheme -RRB- .
This permits attacks when hashing is not used on the message to be signed .
Few practical attacks are of this form .
The term `` lunchtime attack '' refers to the idea that a user 's computer , with the ability to decrypt , is available to an attacker while the user is out to lunch .
A -LRB- full -RRB- adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack is an attack in which ciphertexts may be chosen adaptively before and after a challenge ciphertext is given to the attacker , with ONE condition that the challenge ciphertext may not itself be queried .
A chosen-ciphertext attack -LRB- CCA -RRB- is an attack model for cryptanalysis in which the cryptanalyst gathers information , at least in part , by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key .
Cryptosystems proven secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks include the Cramer-Shoup system and RSA-OAEP .
Additionally , some cryptosystems -LRB- such as RSA -RRB- use the same mechanism to sign messages and to decrypt them .
This attack is sometimes called the `` non-adaptive chosen ciphertext attack '' ; here , `` non-adaptive '' refers to the fact that the attacker can not adapt their queries in response to the challenge , which is given after the ability to make chosen ciphertext queries has expired .
Many chosen-ciphertext attacks of practical importance are lunchtime attacks , including , for instance , when Daniel Bleichenbacher of Bell Laboratories demonstrated a practical attack against systems using the PKCS # 1 ; invented and published by RSA Security .
A better approach is to use a cryptosystem which is provably secure under chosen-ciphertext attack , including -LRB- among others -RRB- RSA-OAEP , Cramer-Shoup and many forms of authenticated symmetric encryption .
Chosen-ciphertext attacks , like other attacks , may be adaptive or non-adaptive .
A proof that attacks in this model are impossible implies that any practical chosen-ciphertext attack can not be performed .
This form of the attack was the first one commonly discussed : obviously , if the attacker has the ability to make adaptive chosen ciphertext queries , no encrypted message would be safe , at least until that ability is taken away .
This can be more difficult than it appears , as even partially chosen ciphertexts can permit subtle attacks .
Rather , this model is important for its use in proofs of security against chosen-ciphertext attacks .

He met many great jazz musicians , like Louis Armstrong .
He met Fats Waller , who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater , accompanying silent movies , and Waller taught him how to play the organ .
His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a rich judge .
Soon , Basie met many Harlem musicians , like Willie `` the Lion '' Smith and James P. Johnson .
In 1929 , Basie started playing with the Bennie Moten band , Kansas City .
He began to be known as `` Count '' Basie .
They played together until Greer started his professional career .
Basie made a new band , which included many of the musicians from Moten 's band . Lester Young , a saxophone player , also joined .
Soon after he went to Harlem , he met Sonny Greer again , who was now the drummer for the Washingtonians , Duke Ellington 's early band .
Basie played with different groups for dances , resorts , and amateur shows , like Harry Richardsonâ s `` Kings of Syncopation '' .
It became his signature tune .
A few months later , Basie was asked to join the band , which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma .
When they were staying in Chicago , Basie recorded with the band .
Basie toured in some acts between 1925 and 1927 , as a soloist and accompanist to blues singers Katie Krippen and Gonzelle White .
One day , when the pianist did not arrive in time for the show , Basie played instead .
One night the band started -LRB- -LRB- improvisation improvising a piece which Basie called `` One O'Clock Jump '' .

He also learned to use the spotlights for the vaudeville shows .
He helped out at the Palace theater in Red Bank , to get into the shows for free .
As well as playing piano , Basie also arranged music with Eddie Durham .
Many important musicians came to became popular and successful with his help , like tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans , trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry `` Sweets '' Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams .
Around 1924 , Basie went to Harlem , New York City . A lot of jazz was being played there .
He only got as far as junior high school .

One of his plays , The Persians , was about the Persian invasion of Greece . Aeschylus had fought in this war .
Only six tragedies have survived intact : The Persians , Seven against Thebes , The Suppliants , the trilogy known as The Oresteia , consisting of the three tragedies Agamemnon , The Libation Bearers and The Eumenides . There is also the play Prometheus Bound , but this was probably written by someone else .
By 473 BC , Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia , winning first prize in nearly every competition .
Pausanias wrote that Aeschylus worked in a vineyard until the god Dionysus visited him in his sleep .
It is said that he was killed by a tortoise which fell out of the sky after it was dropped by an eagle .
Aeschylus was born about the year 525 BC in a small town called Eleusis , which is about 27 kilometers northwest of Athens . The date is based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia .
Aristotle wrote that some people thought that Aeschylus had shown some of the cult 's secrets on stage .
When Aeschylus first began writing , the theater was new . Some playwrights like Thespis had made the cast bigger to include an actor who was able to talk with the chorus .
Fifty years after Aeschylus ' death , the comic playwright Aristophanes praised him in the The Frogs .
During Aeschylus ' lifetime , dramatic competitions became part of the City Dionysia in the spring .
When they walked on stage in the first performance of the Eumenides , the chorus of Furies were so frightening in looks that they made young children faint , old men urinate , and pregnant women go into labor .
His family was rich , and his father , Euphorion , was a member of the Eupatridae , the ancient nobility of Attica .
The festival began with an opening procession , then a competition of boys singing dithyrambs , and finally two dramatic competitions .
In 490 BC the Persian army , led by Darius , landed in Greece and tried to take it over . Aeschylus , and his brother Cynegeirus , joined the army from Athens and fought against the Persians at the Battle of Marathon .
Aeschylus is a character in the play and says that his Seven against Thebes `` made everyone watching it to love being warlike '' -LRB- line 1022 -RRB- ; with his Persians , he says he `` taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies '' -LRB- line 1026-7 -RRB- .
Aeschylus ' work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death , his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in future competitions .
Aeschylus added a second actor , allowing for more drama ; and the chorus became less important .
People studying Greek history use his play as an important source of information .
The first competition was for three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays , followed by a shorter comedy .
All of the surviving plays won first prize at the City Dionysia . One book , the Alexandrian Life of Aeschylus , said that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia 13 times .
Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who joined the Eleusinian Mysteries . This was the religious cult to Demeter , and based in his home town of Eleusis .
He says that his plays helped the Athenians to be brave and virtuous -LRB- line 1039ff -RRB- .
Cynegeirus died in the battle .
Members were sworn under the penalty of death not to say anything about the Mysteries to anyone .
Other writers said that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot , but he ran away .
Greek drama began with festivals for the gods , mainly Dionysus , the god of wine .
Aeschylus also added more details to the costumes , and had his actors wear platform boots , called cothurni , to help the audience see them better .
He is said to have been the first to use skenographia , or scene-decoration , but Aristotle said the first person was Sophocles .
His sons Euphorion and EuÃ on , and his nephew Philocles , all wrote plays as well .
In 458 BC , he returned to Sicily for the last time , visiting the city of Gela where he died in 456 or 455 BC .
Aeschylus took part in many of these competitions in his lifetime .
His oldest surviving play The Persians , performed in 472 BC , is set during the Battle of Salamis . This play won first prize at the Dionysia .
In 480 BC , Xerxes I of Persia , tried to capture Greece . Aeschylus fought against them at the Battle of Salamis and at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC .
On one these trips he wrote The Women of Aetna , in honor of the city founded by Hieron . He also restaged his Persians .
A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed , and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a group of judges .
It has a V-shaped molecular structure like H2O , but has different properties . It is a strong oxidizer .
Oxygen difluoride is the chemical compound with the formula OF2 .
OF2 reacts with many metals . It produces oxides and fluorides .
Nowadays , it is prepared by the reaction of fluorine with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide . Sodium fluoride is left as a side-product :
Above 200 Â C , OF2 decomposes to oxygen and fluorine .
Oxygen difluoride was first prepared in 1929 . It was made by the electrolysis of molten potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid .
Phosphorus reacts with OF2 to form PF5 and POF3 . Sulfur produces SO2 and SF4 with it .
It is a very powerful oxidizing agent . This is proved by the oxidation number of +2 for the oxygen atom .

This organ is usually called electric organ . It is usually located near the tail of the fish .
Fishes that can generate such fields are said to be electrogenic , those that can detect them are called electroreceptive .
An Electric fish is a fish that can make electric fields .
When the organ produces electricity that is released this is called Electric Organ Discharge -LRB- or EOD for short -RRB- .
Most bony fish are neither electrogenic nor electroreceptive .
Many fish , for example sharks , rays , and catfishes are electroreceptive . They can not generate electric fields though , and are therefore not classified as electric fish .
Most electrogenic fish are also electroreceptive .

The Battle of Britain is the name given to the air campaign waged by the German Air Force -LRB- Luftwaffe -RRB- against Britain during the summer and autumn of 1940 .
The keystone of the British defense was the detection , command , and control which ran the battle .
The total casualties on this critical day were 60 German and 26 RAF aircraft shot down .
On 27 September , a Junkers Ju 88 returning from a raid on London was shot down in Kent , the last action between British and foreign military forces on British mainland soil .
The core of Dowding 's system was the use of Radio Direction Finding -LRB- RDF , later called radar , for radio detection and ranging -RRB- .
The two British fighters were equipped with eight Browning 303 machine guns , while most Bf 109Es had two machine guns and two wing cannons .
Radar operators were linked via telephone -LRB- whose wires were laid deep underground with concrete anti-bomb protection -RRB- p47 to an operational center . This center was Fighter Command control at Bentley Priory .
On 15 September two massive waves of German attacks were decisively repulsed by the RAF , with every aircraft of 11 Group being used on that day .

This version was capable of a maximum speed of 342 mph , some 25 to 30 mph faster than the Mk I.
They returned , apologetic about their limited success , and blamed the delay on being requested too late .
However , the Bf 109E had a much larger turning circle than either the Hurricane or the Spitfire .
The Luftwaffes Messerschmitt Bf 109E and 110C squared up against the RAF 's workhorse Hurricane Mk I and the less numerous Spitfire Mk I. The Bf 109E had a better climb rate and was 10 to 30 mph faster than the Hurricane , depending on altitude .
As the battle progressed the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure .
The first objective of the campaign was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force -LRB- RAF -RRB- , especially Fighter Command .
The German defeat caused Hitler to order , two days later , the `` postponement '' of preparations for the invasion of Britain .
12 Group 's Big Wing took twenty minutes to gain formation , missing its intended target , but encountering another formation of bombers while still climbing .
p266 In September 1940 the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricanes started entering service although only in small numbers .
Henceforth , in the face of mounting losses in men , aircraft and the lack of adequate replacements , the Luftwaffe switched from daylight to night-time bombing .
This was the ` Dowding System ' , after its chief architect , Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding , the leader of RAF Fighter Command .
The Bf 109E and the Spitfire were superior to each other in key areas ; for instance , at some altitudes , the Bf 109 could out-climb the British fighter .
The RAF 11 Group rose to meet them , in greater numbers than the Luftwaffe expected .

Twelve characters are available from the beginning ; the other twelve and the two Mii variants become available after finishing certain elements of the game .
Mario Kart Wii is a kart racing video game made by Nintendo for the Wii game console .
The Mii 's weight class depends on its height and weight -LRB- this can be customize in the Mii Channel -RRB- , and its favorite color changes the color scheme of its clothing , while the gender changes the color scheme of their cars .
In Mario Kart Wii , players choose a character from a roster having of up to 24 characters and from 36 cars .
Each car has seven different parameters for characteristics : speed , weight , acceleration , handling , drift , off-road , and mini-turbo .
A character 's weight decides the available types of karts and motorbikes , and their performance on the tracks .
There are eight characters of each weight class .
and Mario Kart DS , and two each from Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart : Super Circuit .
One new item to the series is the `` Lightning Cloud '' , which raises the user 's top speed briefly , but shrinks the user if it is not passed on to an opponent by colliding with them .
Mario Kart Wii has 32 different tracks , having 16 new tracks , four tracks each from Mario Kart 64 , Mario Kart : Double Dash ! !
Players get items by driving through item boxes , which can be used for either defense , offense , or for powering up the engine .
In addition to this , there are 12 different kinds -LRB- 3 weight classes , 2 genders , 2 outfits -RRB- of the Mii , the digital avatar made by Nintendo .

West Texas State University began wind energy research in 1970 and led to the formation of the Alternative Energy Institute -LRB- AEI -RRB- in 1977 .
It is spread across approximately 47,000 acres in Taylor and Nolan County near Abilene . ''
Texas farmers may lease their land to wind developers for either a set rental per turbine or for a small percentage of gross annual revenue from the project .
AEI has been a major information resource about wind energy for Texas .
`` Wind resource areas in the Texas Panhandle , along the Gulf Coast south of Galveston , and in the mountain passes and ridge tops of the Trans-Pecos offer Texas some of the greatest wind power potential in the United States .
The wind power industry is also creating thousands of jobs for communities and for the state .
Wind power in Texas consists of many wind farms with a total installed generating capacity of 9,410 MW from over 40 different projects . Texas produces the most wind power of any U.S. state , followed by Iowa with 3,670 MW .
Wind is a highly variable resource , but with proper understanding it can be readily incorporated into an electric utility 's generation mix .
The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged , the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected .
The table below lists the larger wind farms in Texas , currently operating or under construction .
Wind power has a long history in Texas .
Wind farms which are smaller than 120 MW in capacity are not shown .
The broad scope and geographical extent of wind farms in Texas is considerable :
Other large wind farms in Texas include : Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center , Sherbino Wind Farm , Capricorn Ridge Wind Farm , Sweetwater Wind Farm , Buffalo Gap Wind Farm , King Mountain Wind Farm , Desert Sky Wind Farm , Wildorado Wind Ranch , and the Brazos Wind Farm .
Several forces are driving the growth of wind power in Texas : the wind resource in many areas of the state is very large , large projects are relatively easy to site , and the market price for electricity is set by natural gas prices and so is relatively high .
The number of commercially attractive sites will expand as wind turbine technology improves and development costs continue to drop .
The Roscoe Wind Farm -LRB- 781 MW -RRB- is the world 's largest wind farm .
Wind technology and the various aspects of producing electricity from wind power can help to keep employment in Texas after the rigs stop producing oil .
The expanding wind power market will help Texas meet its 2015 renewable energy goal of 5,000 new megawatts of power from renewable sources .
Wind power in Texas consists of many wind farms with a total installed generating capacity of 9,410 MW from over 40 different projects .
However , wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired .
The Roscoe Wind Farm -LRB- 781 MW -RRB- is the world 's largest wind farm . Other large wind farms in Texas include : Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center , Sherbino Wind Farm , Capricorn Ridge Wind Farm , Sweetwater Wind Farm , Buffalo Gap Wind Farm , King Mountain Wind Farm , Desert Sky Wind Farm , Wildorado Wind Ranch , and the Brazos Wind Farm .
Most of the new wind capacity added in the last two years has been in the Abilene-Sweetwater area .
Currently there are over 2,000 wind turbines in West Texas alone .
The Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center is the largest wind power facility in the nation with a total capacity of 735 MW .
Texas produces the most wind power of any U.S. state , followed by Iowa with 3,670 MW .
Should one of these plants be damaged , repairs could take more than a year , possibly creating power shortages on a scale that Texans have never experienced before .
These figures are rising as larger wind turbines are being produced and installed .
Terrorism and industrial accidents can be potential threats to the large , centrally located , power plants that provide most of Texasâ electricity .
Although leasing arrangements vary widely , the U. S. Government Accountability Office reported in 2004 that a farmer who leases land to a wind project developer can generally obtain royalties of $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 per turbine per year in lease payments .

Rail transport systems developed independently on the two islands of Great Britain and Ireland , and most of the railway construction in the Republic of Ireland was undertaken before independence in 1922 .
By 1801 , a recipe for tomato ketchup was created by Sandy Addison . It was later printed in an American cookbook , the Sugar House Book .
In October 2000 , Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt . They included green , purple , pink , orange , teal , and blue colored ketchup .
They were less vinegary than modern ketchups . By pickling ripe tomatoes , the need for benzoate was eliminated .
In fast food chains , ketchup is often put in small packets that hold ketchup inside .
In an earlier approach , some fast food outlets dispense ketchup from pumps into paper cups .
Prior to Heinz -LRB- and his fellow innovators -RRB- , commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin . This was due to the use of unripe tomatoes .
Harvey W. Wiley challenged the safety of benzoate .
As the century went on , tomato ketchup became more popular in the United States . More Americans began to like tomatoes .
These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup .
As of 2006 these products have been discontinued .
Although today 's ketchup is tomato based , it did not appear until about a century after other types .
By 1837 , he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally .
In response , business owners , particularly Henry J. Heinz , pursued a different recipe that did not use that preservative .
Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers .
F. & J. Heinz created their tomato ketchup in 1876 .
The Webster 's Dictionary of 1913 defined `` catchup '' as a `` table sauce made from mushrooms , tomatoes , walnuts , etc. -LRB- Written also ketchup -RRB- . ''
Users tear the side or top of the packet . They then squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets .
In 1824 , a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in The Virginia Housewife . This was an important 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph , Thomas Jefferson 's cousin .
Heinz tomato ketchup was advertised : `` Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household ! ''
Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century . This came from a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments .
A man named Jonas Yerks -LRB- or Yerkes -RRB- is believed to have been the first man to make tomato ketchup a national phenomenon .
Ketchup is a kind of thick , liquid sauce . It is made from tomatoes , so it is sometimes called tomato sauce .
In 2010 , Heinz is offering an alternate squeeze and dip cup . This is meant to offer a cleaner method of dispensing the product .
Shortly after that , other companies did the same .
James Mease published another recipe in 1812 .

The king shouted with a loud voice , `` You are great , O Lord , the God of Daniel , and there is no other besides you ! ''
Daniel proves through a ruse that the sacred meal of Bel is actually consumed at night by the seventy priests and their wives and children , who entered through a secret door when the temple 's doors were sealed .
Daniel remained unharmed in the den with seven lions , fed by the miraculous transportation of the prophet Habakkuk .
Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day ? ''
It has been made into a consequence of the preceding episode , but the Septuagint precedes it with the notice : `` From the prophecy of Habakkuk , son of Jesus , of the tribe of Levi . ''
`` On the seventh day the king came to mourn for Daniel .
This version has been cited as an ancestor of the `` locked room mystery '' .
The third narrative -LRB- 14:31 -- 42 -RRB- , Daniel in the Lions ' Den , is apparently Daniel 's 1st or 2nd trip .
In the brief companion narrative of the Dragon -LRB- 14:23 -- 30 -RRB- , `` there was a great dragon , which the Babylonians revered . ''
`` The king has become a Jew ; he has destroyed Bel , and killed the dragon , and slaughtered the priests , '' they said , and demanded that Daniel be handed over to them .
The priests and their wives and children are killed , and Daniel is permitted to destroy the idol of Bel and the temple .
The tale of Bel and the Dragon is from chapter 14 of the Book of Daniel .
Some have suggested that the Daniel in Bel and the Dragon is different from that of Daniel 1-13 .
There Daniel `` was a companion of the king , and was the most honored of all his Friends '' -LRB- 14:1 -RRB- .
This chapter , along with chapter 13 , is referred to as deuterocanonical , in that it is not universally accepted among Christians as belonging to the Bible .
When he came to the den he looked in , and there sat Daniel !
Then he pulled Daniel out , and threw into the den those who had attempted his destruction , and they were instantly eaten before his eyes . ''
In it , the king asks Daniel `` Do you not think that Bel is a living god ?
Now the Babylonians were indignant .
The chapter is formed of three independent narratives , which place the culture-hero Daniel at the court of Cyrus , king of the Persians : `` When King Astyages was laid to rest with his ancestors , Cyrus the Persian succeeded to his kingdom . ''

Regardless of what these birds ate , the beak may have been used also for social display â `` its presence in all known fossils argues against a sexual display role .
In late Paleocene deposits of Spain and early Eocene deposits of France , shell fragments of huge eggs have turned up in Provence .
In the 1870s , the famous American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope discovered another , more complete set of fossils in North America , and named them Diatryma .
The mid-Eocene saw the rise of large creodont and mesonychid predators in Eurasia and North America . The appearance of these new predators coincides with the decline of Gastornis and its relatives .
If these huge birds were active hunters , they must have been important apex predators which dominated the forest ecosystems of North America and Europe until the middle Eocene .
On the other hand , ratites , the flightless giant birds of our time , feed on plants , small vertebrates , and invertebrates .
It may be that Gastornis was an ambush hunter , or used pack hunting techniques to pursue or ambush prey . If Gastornis was a predator , it would have needed some means of hunting prey through the dense forest .
The former were certainly carnivorous , and the latter are suspected of being predators , too .
Gastornis has been depicted as predatory .
This was possibly due to an increased tendency of mammalian predators to hunt together in packs -LRB- especially in the hyaena-like creodonts -RRB- .
Similar gigantic birds of the Cenozoic were the South American terror birds -LRB- phorusrhacids -RRB- and the Australian mihirungs -LRB- Dromornis -RRB- .
These contradicting hypotheses , which ca n't be separated by the evidence , make the paleobiology of Gastornis unclear .
However , some doubt the bird was agile enough to catch fast-moving prey , and have doubts about the beak being right for carnivory .
Gastornis parisiensis measured on average 1.75 metres -LRB- 5.7 ft -RRB- tall , but large individuals grew up to 2 metres -LRB- 6.6 ft -RRB- tall .
At its time , the environment where Gastornis lived had dense forest and a moist to dry subtropical or even tropical climate .
Alternatively , they may have been mainly scavengers , omnivores or even herbivores .
North America and Europe were still rather close , and Greenland probably was covered with lush woodland and grassland . Only narrow straits of a few 100 km at most would have blocked landbound dispersal of the Gastornis ancestors .
These are presumably from Gastornis .
We know of no bird which weighed more than half a metric ton . Perhaps they could not evolve to larger sizes .
Gastornis had a huge beak with a slightly hooked top , which suggests that it was carnivorous .
Gastornis were among the largest , if not the largest birds alive during the Paleogene .
The fossil remains of these birds have been found in western-central Europe -LRB- England , Belgium , France and Germany -RRB- as well as North America .
Gastornis had large powerful legs , with large , taloned feet , which also were considered in support of the theory that it was a predator .
The large beak of Gastornis would have been suited for crushing seeds and tearing off vegetation .

Few ciphers have unusual block sizes , for example the 3-Way block cipher have an unusual block size of 96 bits -LRB- 12 bytes -RRB- .
Both the input -LRB- plaintext -RRB- and output -LRB- ciphertext -RRB- are the same length ; the output can not be shorter than the input -- this is logically required by the Pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be invertible -- and it is simply undesirable for the output to be longer than the input .
A few block ciphers , such as RC5 , support a variable block size .
Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits .
The DES is using a block size of 64 bits -LRB- 8 bytes -RRB- while the AES is using a block size of 128 bits -LRB- 16 bytes -RRB- .
The Luby-Rackoff construction and the Outerbridge construction can both increase the effective block size of a cipher .
Rijndael , supports block sizes of 128 , 192 , and 256 bits , although the extra block sizes were not adopted by the AES standard .
In modern cryptography , symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers .
The length of this bit string is the block size .

If the sea bottom , which is in very few parts as much as 20 fathoms deep , were elevated 120 f , the island of Alderney , the Burhou and Ortac group , and the Casquets would be connected by low land , and form a narrow island around 12 m long .
Ortac is noted for its large gannet colony .
... on the port bow arose , standing stark , cut out on the background of mist , a tall opaque mass , vertical , right-angled , a tower of the abyss .
Its position is 49 Â 59 ' 57N , 2 Â 0 ' 18W , which is about 30 miles north-north-east of Alderney .
It was the Ortac rock .
For it has been discovered , and is now well established , that the lonely inhabitant Of the rock is not a saint , but a devil .
The Norman fishermen who frequent the Channel have many precautions to take at sea , by reason of the illusions with which Satan environs them .
Paul Naftel , a Guernsey artist , drew Ortac , and the drawing appeared in Ansted & Latham 's book , The Channel Islands -LRB- 1862 -RRB- .
This is of fairly recent origin .
Ortac and Alderney , along with the Casquets , are part of the same sandstone ridge .
The Ortac , all of a piece , rises up in a straight line to eighty feet above the angry beating of the waves ... An immovable cliff , it plunges its rectilinear planes apeak into the numberless serpentine coils of the sea .
A.H. Ewen thinks that the rock 's name meant `` large rock at the edge '' from the Norman language Or -LRB- edge -RRB- + Etac -LRB- Stack -RRB- .
He found only one gannet .
It has long been an article of popular faith that Saint Maclou inhabited the great square rock called Ortac , in the sea between Alderney and the Casquets ; and many old sailors used to declare that they had often seen him there , seated and reading a book .
This evil spirit , whose name is Jochmus , had the impudence to pass himself of ; for many centuries as Saint Maclou .
On 19 June 1940 , Major J.A.A. Wallace was preparing for the evacuation of Alderney , and went there to inspect the kittiwake colony .
Accordingly the sailors , as they passed , were in the habit of kneeling many times before the Ortac rock , until the day when the fable was destroyed , and the truth took its place .
Even the Church herself is not proof against snares of this kind .
Between Ortac , Verte TÃ te and Burhou Island , are scattered many dangerous rocks , and ledges among which the streams run with great velocity .
At night it stands an enormous block , resting on the folds of a huge black sheet .
There is a reporting point named ORTAC at southern boundary between Romeo 41 and the Channel Islands Control Zone .
In time of storm it awaits the stroke of the axe which is ` the thunderclap ' ... ` To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons ; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder ... On a straight frontage , such of that of the Ortac , neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet ... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it , and is lost ...
Romeo 41 is an Airway over the English Channel from the Channel Islands Control Area to the Solent Control Area .
He found none on Les Etacs off Alderney .
The demons Ragubel , Oribel , and Tobiel were regarded as saints until the year 745 , when Pope Zachary , having at length exposed them , turned them out of saintly company .
Ortac is a small uninhabited islet about 5 km West of the coast of Alderney near to the islet of Burhou .

The bones of the hand were fused together , as in modern birds , and a ridge on the ulna -LRB- lower arm bone -RRB- was interpreted as an attachment point for feathers by Kurzanov .

It represents 10 objects -LRB- rows -RRB- and five features -LRB- columns -RRB- .
Each table cell therefore designates the value -LRB- also known as `` state '' -RRB- of a particular attribute of a particular object .
Below is a sample attribute-value system .
In general , an attribute-value system may contain any kind of data , numeric or otherwise .
In this example , the table contains only integer values .
An attribute-value system is a basic knowledge representation framework comprising a table with columns designating `` attributes '' -LRB- also known as `` properties '' , `` predicates , '' `` features , '' `` dimensions , '' `` characteristics '' or `` independent variables '' depending on the context -RRB- and rows designating `` objects '' -LRB- also known as `` entities , '' `` instances , '' `` exemplars , '' `` elements '' or `` dependent variables .

Defensive indifference is usually only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run .
It is possible to steal second base , third base , or home plate , but not to steal first base .
If the defense does not try to put the baserunner out -LRB- for example , if the catcher does not even look his way -RRB- , the play is called defensive indifference -LRB- also called fielder 's indifference -RRB- . No stolen base is credited to the runner in this case .
The scoring and guidelines for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 10.07 of the Major League Baseball rule book .
A player who is good at stealing bases needs not just running speed , but also good base-running instincts , quickness , and split-second timing .

A physical USB device can have several logical sub-devices that are referred to as device functions .
If the device is supported by the host , the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state .
USB was designed to be easy to use . When the connectors were designed , lessons learned from other connection techologies were also applied to USB connectors .
A single device may provide several functions , for example , a webcam -LRB- video device function -RRB- with a built-in microphone -LRB- audio device function -RRB- .
After reset , the USB device 's information is read by the host , then the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address .
USB devices are linked in series through hubs .
The host controller polls the bus for traffic , usually in a round-robin fashion , so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller .
Pipes are connections from the host controller to a logical entity on the device named an endpoint .
USB allows connecting USB hubs to add more USB ports .
Endpoints are grouped into interfaces and each interface is associated with a single device function .
These allow multiple computers to access the same peripheral devices . They work by switching the access between PCs , either manually or automatically .
Additional USB hubs may be included in the tiers , allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels .
The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device .
Most people use USB for computer mice , keyboards , scanners , printers , digital cameras , and USB flash drives .
Each host controller provides one or more USB ports . Up to 127 devices , including the hub devices , may be connected to a single host controller .
In network terms , they converge rather than diverge branches .
Up to 127 devices , including the hub devices , may be connected to a single host controller .
They are popular in small-office environments .
There is always one hub known as the root hub . The root hub is built into to the host controller .
A USB system has an asymmetric design . It is made of a host , several downstream USB ports , and multiple peripheral devices connected in a star topology .
When a USB device is first connected to a USB host , the USB device enumeration process is started .
A USB device can have up to 32 active pipes , 16 into the host controller and 16 out of the controller .
If the USB host is restarted , the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices .
The speed of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling .
USB device communication is based on pipes -LRB- logical channels -RRB- .
Currently , there are three different USB standards that are used : USB 1.0 , USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 .
An exception to this is endpoint zero , which is used for device configuration and which is not associated with any interface .
A USB host can have multiple host controllers . Each host controller provides one or more USB ports .
On an USB 2.0 controller , standards can be mixed . Devices connected to a USB 1.1 hub will only go as fast as USB 1.1 rates .

1987 -LRB- MCMLXXXVII -RRB- was a common year starting on Thursday of the Gregorian calendar .
In 1898 he used the similarity in embryos to describe evolutionary relationships .
He said that chromosomes were `` independent entities which retain their independence even in the resting nucleus ... What comes out of the nucleus is what goes into it '' .
By observing spiral cleavage in molluscs , flatworms and annelids he concluded that the same organs came from the same group of cells and concluded that all these organisms must have a common ancestor .

The Deccan Traps of central India , the Siberian Traps , and the Columbia River Plateau of western North America are three regions covered by prehistoric flood basalts .
One explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of continental rifting and its associated melting , in conjunction with a mantle plume also undergoing decompression melting , producing vast quantities of a basaltic magma .
These are smaller than the original volumes due to erosion .

Also , the joystick must be in the middle position at least once when the implicit `` self calibration '' takes place , even if this is not directly stated .
This leaves game port support up to the manufacturer of the device -LRB- i.e. Sound card or USB converters -RRB- the game port ships on .
To use a game port with MIDI instruments , one requires a cable with a male and a female DA-15 and two male 5-pin DIN connectors .
The limitation of this method is that the reading of the same joystick over the same game port can change over time , and some joysticks can not work at all with this method .
Game ports use DA-15 connectors -LRB- also incorrectly called DB-15 -RRB- .
The calibration procedure is still needed at some point , even under modern operating systems such as Windows XP .
Some hardware and DIY enthusiasts have found ways to connect a wide array of input devices to the game port and even found other applications for it , such as voltage or current measurement or simple interfacing and data acquisition .
Also , all kinds of PC game ports suffer from electrical noise .
High-end game port joysticks such as the Microsoft SideWinder rely on multiplexing a proprietary data stream through the 4 standard button inputs and sometimes through the `` unused '' pins , achieving full support for a rather high number of buttons -LRB- e.g. 16 or 20 -RRB- while special features such as daisy-chaining multiple joysticks , force feedback or joystick programming become possible in some cases .
The original game port design by IBM -LRB- released in 1981 as a separate expansion card for the first IBM PC -RRB- initially allowed four analog axes and four buttons on one port , allowing two joysticks or four paddles to be connected , although this required a special `` Y-splitter '' cable and is not fully supported by some combined midi\/game ports usually found on sound cards .
One problem was that all kinds of joysticks needed `` calibration '' . This was true even for arcade-style ones .
It can not give an intensity . For this setup , an analog joystick can be `` self calibrated '' just by leaving the joystick in the middle position and taking a measurement , and then using some arbitrary or adaptive threshold to detect movement and excursion from the middle position .
Certain applications and games are able to use some analog joysticks even without explicit calibration , under certain restricted conditions .
This can be overcome by using pins and input meant for the second joystick -LRB- i.e. button 5 through 8 are mapped to the signals to the axis pins meant for the second joystick - resulting in the issue of the two buttons mapped to the same axis being not simultaneously usable -RRB- , using some normally `` unused '' pins , or changing the joystick 's circuits -LRB- and related software -RRB- to read a 4-bit state code from the four button inputs , thus giving up to 16 button combinations -LRB- albeit with some limitations e.g. some buttons may not be held down -RRB- or a combination of both techniques .
The obvious drawback is the need for a special device driver to interpret the joystick input , and making its use time consuming and operating system-dependent , while the joystick is usually unusable without a special driver -LRB- unless multiple operating modes are supported -RRB- .
USB joysticks , on the other hand , do not need calibration .
Usually , it consists of moving the joystick around all of its axes to measure the maximum axis excursion values , no matter if the joystick uses analog signals -LRB- from potentiometers -RRB- or digital signals -LRB- using microswitches or contacts -RRB- .
Some poorly implemented game ports -LRB- usually built-in on old motherboards and I\/O cards -RRB- did not fully support either 4 axes or 4 buttons , making only the use of a single 2-axis and 2-button joystick possible .
This must be done more than 30 times every second to provide a responsive game input . The actual acquisition frequency and value usually depend on the joystick 's resistance inside , noise , CPU speed and the total joystick-capacitor 's RC time constant .
Since the game port moved from dedicated expansion cards to sound cards about 1990 , these connectors usually double as connectors for MIDI instruments ; two of the redundant +5 V and GND pins of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output to make this possible .
The 15-pin game port is no longer provided on presently manufactured PCs , though adapters exist that allow older joysticks and controllers to connect via USB .
In the days of DOS , every game using the game port -LRB- s -RRB- had to do its own calibration , often each time the game started , and some poorly coded calibration routines even failed to work consistently and properly , rendering some joysticks unusable with some games .
The drivers and hardware for the game port midi capabilities are based around the now standard Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface -LRB- in UART mode only -RRB- , and support most MPU-401 standard applications for Windows and DOS .
With Windows XP , only one calibration per joystick is enough , which is thought `` valid '' until the joystick is unplugged .
The official proper design for a game port-MIDI adapter can be found at this MIDI page .
Some advanced game port joysticks supports more than 4 buttons -LRB- e.g. 6 or 8 -RRB- but typically require a special device driver for the additional buttons to work properly , since the game port does not have actual hardware support for more than 4 distinct buttons .
Microsoft declared it would no longer include support for game ports in operating systems beginning with MS-Windows XP Professional x64 edition , reasoning that USB-based gaming equipment had become more common .

Thermometers are an example of an application of thermal expansion â `` they contain a liquid which is constrained to flow in only one direction -LRB- along the tube -RRB- due to changes in volume brought about by changes in temperature .
In physics , thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature .
Materials that contract with an increase in temperature are very uncommon ; this effect is limited in size , and only occurs within limited temperature ranges .
When a substance is heated , its constituent particles move around more quickly and by doing so generally maintain a greater average separation .
Common engineering solids usually have thermal expansion coefficients that do not vary significantly over the range of temperatures where they are designed to be used , so where extremely high accuracy is not required , calculations can be based on a constant , average , value of the coefficient of expansion .
The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material 's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature .

In 1984 , Shafi Goldwasser , Silvio Micali , and Ronald Rivest became the first to strictly define the security requirements of digital signature schemes .
The message can not be modified , and if modified a new message with a valid signature can not be produced .
Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures , a broader term that refers to any electronic data that holds a meaning of a signature , but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures .
A digital signature or digital signature scheme is a type of asymmetric cryptography .
For messages sent through an insecure channel , a good implementation of digital signature algorithm is the one that makes the receiver believe that the message was sent by the claimed sender , and trust the message .
They described a hierarchy of attack models for signature schemes , they also present the GMR signature scheme .
The strongest notion of security , therefore , is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack .
A digital signature is an electronic signature .
Digital signature are implemented using cryptography . Digital signatures can also provide acknowledgement , meaning that the signer can not successfully claim they did not sign a message , while also claiming their private key remains secret ;
Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects ; properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to copy than the handwritten type .
In some countries , including the United States , and in the European Union , electronic signatures may have legal significance .
If a message is digitally signed , any change in the message after signature will invalidate the signature .

Recent analysis of twenty nuclear genes suggests that the flighted tinamous cluster within the ratite lineage .
Their closest living relatives are the tinamous of South America .
If so , this would make ` ratites ' , as a whole , paraphyletic rather than monophyletic .
Since tinamous are weak fliers , this raises interesting questions about the evolution of flightlessness in this group .
Re-evolution of flight in the tinamous would be an alternative explanation , but that has no precedent in bird evolution , while loss of flight is commonplace .
Therefore , ratites are a group of medium to large birds , most of whom are flightless , with the exception of the tinamous . The ratites evolved flightlessness more than once .
Most parts of the former super-continent Gondwana have ratites , or did have until the fairly recent past .

After a long , difficult negotiation , which he reported in the Chess Player 's Chronicle , Staunton went to Paris intending to start their third match in October 1844 , but he caught pneumonia while traveling and almost died ; the match was postponed and never took place .

Howard Staunton -LRB- 1810 â `` 22 June 1874 -RRB- was an English chess master . He was probably the world 's strongest player from 1843 to 1851 .
Staunton gained a seven-game lead but then struggled to keep it before winning the match 13-8 -LRB- eleven wins , four draws , and six losses -RRB- in December 1843 .
A memorial plaque now hangs at his old residence of 117 Lansdowne Road , London W11 .
Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham , his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely , and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match .
In the mid-1850s Staunton got a contract to edit the text of Shakespeare .
Staunton replied , thanking the Club and Morphy `` for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion '' . Staunton pointed out that he had not competed for several years and was working six days a week -LRB- on editing Shakespeare -RRB- , and so he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match .
On 6 October 1858 , while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications , in which Morphy complained about Staunton 's conduct .
He then became chess editor of the magazine British Miscellany , and his chess column developed into a separate magazine , the Chess Player 's Chronicle , which Staunton owned and edited until the early 1850s .
It contained over 300 pages of opening analysis , and almost 100 pages of endgame analysis .
In April 1845 Staunton and Captain Kennedy traveled to Gosport to play two games by telegraph against a group in London .
Staunton produced over 1,400 weekly articles for the Illustrated London News .
At the same time he was also working on his last chess book , Chess : theory and practice , which was published posthumously in 1876 .
In early August , Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur , and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks .
The first chess match by electric telegraph took place in 1844 , between Washington and Baltimore .
In 1860 he published Chess Praxis , a supplement to his 1847 work The Chess Player 's Handbook .
In 1871 his report of a telegraphic match between Sydney and Adelaide calculated that the 74 moves of the longest game had traveled a total of 220,000 miles -LRB- not much less than the distance between Earth and Moon -RRB- .
These events helped to make London the world 's leading chess center . The winner of the tournament , Anderssen , became recognized as the world 's strongest player .
The new book devoted 168 pages to presenting many of Morphy 's games and praised the American 's play .
From May to December 1840 Staunton edited a chess column for the New Court Gazette .
Five years later Staunton published Great Schools of England -LRB- 1865 -RRB- , whose main subject was the history of major English public schools but which also presented some progressive ideas : learning can only take place successfully if the active interest of the student is engaged ; corporal punishment is to be avoided and fagging should be abolished .
A little later that year he lost a short match -LRB- 2 Â 1\/2 -3 Â 1\/2 -RRB- in London against the visiting French player Saint-Amant , who was the best French player at that time .
Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play .
At first , Staunton declined Morphy 's offer saying that the challenge came too late . Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play .
All these works were highly regarded at the time .
While Staunton was busy with the Shakespeare edition , he received a courteous letter from the New Orleans Chess Club , inviting him to that city to play Paul Morphy , who had won the first American Chess Congress .
The London Chess Club , which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues , organized a tournament that was played a month later and had a multi-national set of players , many of whom had competed in Staunton 's tournament . The result was the same â `` Anderssen won .
In September the Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column .
On 23 October , Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy 's open letter .
Saint-Amant wanted a third match , but Staunton was initially unwilling as he had developed heart trouble during the second match .
In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given time to get back into practice , and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work .
When he died suddenly of heart disease , on 22 June 1874 , he was at his desk writing one of these papers .
The committee had also organized a ` London Provincial Tournament ' for other British players , and promoted some of the entrants to play in the International Tournament to get the right number of players for a knock-out tournament .
Staunton took Thomas Worrall and Harry Wilson to Paris as his assistants ; this is the first known case where seconds were used in a chess match .
Most of his later life was spent in writing about Shakespeare , including : a photo lithographic reproduction of the 1600 Much Ado about Nothing in 1864 and of the first folio of Shakespeare in 1866 . He wrote articles on Unsuspected corruptions of Shakespeare 's text , published from 1872 to his death .
This edition appeared in parts from 1857 to 1860 ; the work was praised in reviews .
Staunton advertised the new set in his Illustrated London News chess column , pointing out that the pieces were easily identifiable , very stable , and good-looking .
He also wrote in the Illustrated London News that he `` had been compelled , by laborious literary occupation , to abandon the practice of chess , beyond the indulgence of an occasional game ... If Mr. Morphy â `` for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration â `` be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe , he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year ; he will then meet in this country , in France , in Germany and in Russia , many champions ... ready to test and do honor to his prowess '' .
Staunton challenged Saint-Amant to a longer match to be played in Paris at the CafÃ de la RÃ gence for a stake of Â # 100 -LRB- equivalent to about Â # 75,000 today -RRB- .
Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and , after a tense discussion , Staunton agreed to play in early November .
Although his articles mostly focused on over-the-board play , a significant number featured correspondence chess .
Staunton took a long-term interest in this solution to the difficulties of travel , and reported telegraph games in the Illustrated London News .
Upon arriving in England in June 1858 , Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match .
Chess historian H.J.R. Murray wrote that Staunton 's letter and article should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer , but that Morphy interpreted them differently , and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton .
Staunton replied on 9 October , re-stating the difficulties he faced , but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match .
In 1845 Staunton began a chess column for the Illustrated London News , which became the most influential chess column in the world and which he continued for the rest of his life .
Some followed with enthusiasm the progress of promising youngsters , including Paul Morphy .
On 23 July 1849 Staunton married Frances Carpenter Nethersole , who had eight children by a previous marriage .
The tournament was a success , but disappointing for Staunton personally ; in the second round he was knocked out by Anderssen , who won the tournament convincingly ; and in the play-off for third place Staunton was narrowly beaten by Elijah Williams .
In 1847 Staunton published his most famous work , The Chess-Player 's Handbook , which is still in print .

One example of evolution at work is the case of the hawthorn fly , Rhagoletis pomonella , which appears to be undergoing sympatric speciation .
The most widely accepted example of sympatric speciation is that of the cichlids of Lake Nabugabo in East Africa , which is thought to be due to sexual selection .
People have argued that the evidences of sympatric speciation are in fact examples of micro-geographic speciation .
New species have been created by domesticated animal husbandry , but the initial dates and methods are not clear .
If their reproductive isolation was complete , then they will have already developed into two separate incompatible species .
Reinforcement is required for separation when there is a `` hybrid zone '' between two forms of a species .
Domestic cattle , on the other hand , can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild ox , gaur , yak , etc. , as they readily produce fertile offspring with them .
Dodd 's experiment has been easy for many others to replicate , including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods .
Each generation was placed into the maze , and the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups .
If the hybrids are infertile , or fertile but less fit than their ancestors , then there will be no further reproductive isolation and speciation has essentially occurred -LRB- e.g. , as in horses and donkeys . -RRB-
This apple-feeding population normally feeds only on apples and not on the historically preferred fruit of hawthorns .
Without reinforcement the two populations or species would have uncontrollable interbreeding .
After thirty-five generations , the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences : they mated only within the areas they preferred , and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas .
The history of such attempts is described in Rice and Hostert -LRB- 1993 -RRB- .
In sympatric speciation , species diverge while inhabiting the same place .
Many of the existing plant and most animal species have apparently undergone polyploidization in their evolutionary history .
Sympatric speciation refers to the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location .
Hybrid offspring are very common in these regions , which are usually created by diverged species coming into secondary contact .
However , not all polyploids are reproductively isolated from their parental plants , and gene flow may still occur for example through triploid hybrid x diploid matings that produce tetraploids .
A distinct population emerged in North America in the 19th century some time after apples , a non-native species , were introduced .
Diane Dodd was also able to show how reproductive isolation can develop from mating preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura after only eight generations using different food types , starch and maltose .
Reinforcement may be induced in artificial selection experiments as described above .
The best-documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed in the late 1980s .
The current hawthorn feeding population does not normally feed on apples .
For example , domestic sheep were created by hybridisation , and no longer produce viable offspring with Ovis orientalis , one species from which they are descended .
The reasoning behind this is that if the parents of the hybrid offspring each have naturally selected traits for their own different environments , the hybrid offspring will bear traits from both , and would not fit either niche as well as either parent .
Reproduction of successful polyploid species is sometimes asexual , by parthenogenesis . For unknown reasons many asexual organisms are polyploid .
Some evidence suggests that sympatric speciation is occurring . Hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies ; and there is little evidence of interbreeding -LRB- researchers have documented a 4-6 % hybridization rate -RRB- .
If their reproductive isolation is incomplete , then further mating between the populations will produce hybrids , which may or may not be fertile .
Hybrid zones are regions where diverged populations meet and interbreed .
Often-cited examples of sympatric speciation are found in insects that become dependent on different host plants in the same area .
Different populations of hawthorn fly feed on different fruits .
The emergence of the new hawthorn fly is an example of evolution in progress .
It may occur after two populations of the same species are separated and then come back into contact .
Polyploidy has caused many rapid speciation events because offspring of , for example , tetraploid x diploid matings often result in triploid sterile progeny .
It lived from about 2.6 until about 1.2 million years ago during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs in Eastern Africa .

LÃ zaro CÃ rdenas del RÃ o -LRB- Jiquilpan , MichoacÃ n , May 21 , 1895 - October 19 , 1970 -RRB- was president of Mexico from 1934 and 1940 .
His first graduate student was James D. Watson , who went on to discover the structure of DNA with Francis Crick .
With the help of physicist Enrico Fermi , whom he knew from his time at the University of Rome , Luria received a fellowship at Columbia University .
As the Nazi German armies invaded France in 1940 , Luria fled on bicycle to Marseilles where he received an immigration visa to the United States .
Without funding sources for work in the U.S. or Italy , Luria left his home country for Paris , France in 1938 .
The idea that natural selection affects bacteria has profound consequences , for example , it explains how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance .
In 1938 , he received a fellowship to study in the United States , where he intended to work with DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck .
Luria was born Salvatore Edoardo Luria in Turin , Italy to an influential Italian Sephardic Jewish family .
In January 1947 , Luria became a naturalized citizen of the United States .
His famous experiment with DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck in 1943 , known as the Luria-Delbr Ã 1\/4 ck experiment , demonstrated that inheritance in bacteria follows Darwinian rather than Lamarckian principles and that mutant genes occurring randomly can still give viral resistance without the virus being present .
Luria arrived in New York City on September 12 , 1940 and soon changed his first and middle names .
Soon after Luria received the award Benito Mussolini 's fascist regime banned Jews from academic research fellowships .
He soon met DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck and Hershey , and they collaborated on experiments at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and in DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck 's lab at Vanderbilt University .
While investigating how a culture of E. coli was able to stop the production of phages , Luria discovered that specific bacterial strains produce enzymes that cut DNA at certain sequences .
These enzymes became known as restriction enzymes and developed into one of the main molecular tools in molecular biology .
He attended the medical school at the University of Turin .
From 1943 to 1950 , he worked at Indiana University , Bloomington .
In 1950 , Luria moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign .
Salvador Edward Luria -LRB- Turin , Italy , August 13 , 1912 -- Lexington , Massachusetts , February 6 , 1991 -RRB- was an Italian microbiologist .

The site for the opening and closing ceremonies was the Melbourne Cricket Ground which was also used during Melbourne 's 1956 Olympic Games .
The 2006 Commonwealth Games were held in Melbourne , Australia between March 15 and March 26 , 2006 .
The mascot for the games was Karak , a Red-tailed Black Cockatoo .
The 2006 Commonwealth Games included 16 sports , with 12 individual sports and 4 team sports .
The following venues were used at the 2006 Commonwealth Games .
Obsidian was rarely used , because is is not widely found . It produces a brilliant blade , but shatters more easily than flint .
Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove , in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe , showed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow , which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was highly prized as a food source .
Later Mousterian handaxes were produced with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner , more symmetrical and have a straight border .
New archaeological evidence from Baise , China shows that there were also hand axes in eastern Asia .
Older hand axes were produced by direct percussion with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border .
A simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes .
An experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe .
Hand axes are found mainly in Africa , Europe and Northern Asia , while South Asia retained flake-industries such as the Hoabinhian .
Hand axes are mainly made of flint , but rhyolites , phonolites , quartzites and other rather coarse rocks were used as well .
Several basic shapes , like cordate , oval , or triangular have been distinguished , but their significance is not agreed upon .
A hand axe is a bifacial stone tool of the Lower and Middle Paleolithic .
Lollipop sequence number spaces are a more recent and sophisticated scheme for dealing with finite-sized sequence numbers in protocols .
However , most sequence numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits , and will wrap around after a sufficiently many numbers have been allocated .
Prior to this two-letter , three-number scheme , the RAF and preceding Royal Flying Corps -LRB- RFC -RRB- utilised a serial consisting of a letter followed by four figures , e.g. , D8096 - a Bristol F. 2 Fighter currently owned by the Shuttleworth Collection , or K5054 - the prototype Supermarine Spitfire .
Many computer programs come with serial numbers , often called `` Compact Disc keys '' , and the installers often require the user to enter a valid serial number to continue .
Thus , recently-allocated serial numbers may duplicate very old serial numbers , but not other recently-allocated serial numbers .
Serial numbers are often used in network protocols .
The serial number follows the aircraft throughout its period of service .
Because of this , the serial number is sometimes called a `` tail number '' .
These numbers are verified using a certain algorithm to avoid usage of counterfeit keys .
In air forces the serial number is used to identify a specific aircraft . It is usually painted on both sides of the aircraft , most often in the tail area , although in some cases the serial is painted on the side of the aircraft 's fin\/rudder -LRB- s -RRB- .
Serial numbers can be very useful for quality control .
Not every numerical identifier is a serial number ; identifying numbers which are not serial numbers are sometimes called nominal numbers .
Certificates and Certificate Authorities -LRB- CA -RRB- are necessary for widespread use of cryptography .
Sequence numbers are almost always non-negative , and typically start at zero or one .
A serial number is a unique number used for identification . Serial numbers are made in such a way that they change by a fixed discrete integer value , each time a new serial number is needed .
To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers , RFC 1982 , `` Serial Number Arithmetic '' defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of serial numbers .
The term `` serial number '' is also used in military formations as an alternative to the expression `` service number '' .
It is the similar to the International Standard Book Number -LRB- ISBN -RRB- for books . It is serially assigned but takes its name from the library science use of serial to mean a periodical , like a newspaper .
Serial numbers can also be used against stealing or imitating products , because it is possible to keep track of which serial numbers have been used . Stolen goods or those with problems can be identified more easily .
During the Second World War RAF aircraft carrying secret equipment or that were in themselves secret had '' \/ G '' added to the end of the serial , the `` G '' signifying `` Guard '' , denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground , e.g. , LZ548\/G â '' the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter , or ML926\/G â '' a de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar .
Serial numbers also help track down counterfeit currency , because in some countries each banknote has a unique serial number .
These depend on applying mathematically rigorous serial numbers and serial number arithmetic
In the case of the UK Royal Air Force -LRB- RAF -RRB- the `` Serial '' takes the form of two letters followed by three numbers , e.g. , BT308 â '' the prototype Avro Lancaster , or XS903 â '' an English Electric Lightning F. 6 at one time based at RAF Binbrook -LRB- http://1000aircraftphotos.com/Contributions/DentonNeville/6467.htm -RRB- .

In a multiprocessor system where each one is executing a single set of instructions , data parallelism is achieved when each processor performs the same task on different pieces of distributed data .
In others , different threads control the operation , but they execute the same code .
Most real programs use a combination of data parallelism and task parallelism .
It contrasts to task parallelism as another form of parallelism .
In some situations , a single execution thread controls operations on all pieces of data .
For example , if we are running code on a 2-processor system -LRB- CPUs A and B -RRB- in a parallel computing environment , and we want to do a task on some data D , it is possible to tell CPU A to do that task on one part of D and CPU B on another part of D simultaneously -LRB- at the same time -RRB- , in order to reduce the runtime of the execution .
Data parallelism -LRB- also known as loop-level parallelism -RRB- is a form of parallel computing for multiple processors using a technique for distributing the data across different parallel processor nodes .

Chris Gueffroy -LRB- 21 June 1968 -- 6 February 1989 -RRB- was the last person to die while trying to escape across the Berlin Wall .
Ingo Heinrich , who fired the shot that killed Gueffroey was sentenced to three and a half years in jail .
Two of them were released in January 1992 .
The judge explained that the short sentences were due to the length of time since the events .
Gueffroy and his friend Christian Gaudian tried to escape from East Berlin to West Berlin on the night of 5 to 6 February 1989 . They tried to cross near the Britz district canal .
In 2000 , two SED officials , Siegfried Lorenz and Hans-Joachim BÃ hme , were tried for the death of Gueffroy and two other young men , but acquitted as the judge could find no evidence that they might have been able to lift the shoot-to-kill order .
Gaudian was badly injured , and was arrested and was sentenced on 24 May 1989 to imprisonment for three years by the Pankow district court for trying illegally to cross the border -LRB- `` versuchten ungesetzlichen GrenzÃ 1\/4 bertritts im schweren Fall '' -RRB- .
In September 1989 Gaudian was freed on bail by the East German government and on 17 October 1989 he was transferred to West Berlin .
The case was retried on 7 August 2004 , and the two men were found guilty and given suspended sentences of 15 months each .

According to some sources , the song emanates from when a female traffic warden named Meta Davis gave a parking ticket to McCartney outside Abbey Road Studios .
Personnel per Ian MacDonald Shawn Phillips has said in an interview that he performed background vocals on the track .
When asked why he had called her `` Rita '' , McCartney replied , `` Well , she looked like a Rita to me '' .
Instead of becoming angry , he accepted it with good grace and expressed his feelings in song .
The term `` meter-maid '' was largely unknown in the UK prior to the song 's release .
The band later added lead vocal , bass , and a three-part backing vocal section .
It is rumored that `` Lovely Rita '' influenced the song `` Pow R. Toc H. '' found on their first album , `` The Piper at the Gates of Dawn '' .
By 21 March , the final mono mix was completed and a month later , the stereo mix was done .
Recording began on 23 February 1967 .
`` Lovely Rita '' is a song by The Beatles performed on the album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , written and sung by Paul McCartney , although as with all McCartney-written Beatles songs it is credited to Lennon\/McCartney .
Using a four-track recorder , this first performance featured Harrison 's guitar on track 1 , Lennon 's guitar on track 2 , Ringo 's drums on track 3 , and McCartney 's piano set on track 4 .
It is American slang for a female traffic warden , now officially known by the gender-neutral term parking attendant .
Pink Floyd watched the Beatles recording `` Lovely Rita '' .
The unusual noises during the song after the lines `` and the bag across her shoulder \/ made her look a little like a military man '' were John Lennon , Paul McCartney , and George Harrison playing comb and paper .

From this point of view , it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness .
These areas are important for the survival of species , biodiversity , ecology , conservation , solitude , and recreation .
Many ecosystems that are , or have been , inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered `` wild . ''
Especially in wealthier , industrialized nations , it has a specific legal meaning as well : as land where development is prohibited by law .
Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas , such as fire suppression and the interruption of animal migration , also affect the wilderness .
Wilderness areas can be found in reserves , estates , farms , conservation areas , ranches , National Forests , National Parks and even in urban areas along rivers , gulches or any undeveloped areas .
Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural , spiritual , moral , and aesthetic reasons .
This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without human interference .
Many new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various Parliaments and Legislatures at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that `` in the end , dedicated , inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society , preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us '' .
The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being `` wilderness '' .
The World Conservation Union -LRB- IUCN -RRB- classifies wilderness at two levels , Ia -LRB- Strict Nature Preserves -RRB- and Ib -LRB- Wilderness areas -RRB- .
The WILD Foundation states that wilderness areas have two dimensions : they must be biologically intact and legally protected .
Many nations have designated wilderness , including Australia , Canada , New Zealand , South Africa and the United States .
Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity .
Probably no place on earth is completely untouched by humanity , either due to past occupation by indigenous people , or through global processes such as climate change .

Western Armenia , also referred to as Byzantine Armenia , later Turkish Armenia , or Ottoman Armenia is a term coined following the division of Greater Armenia between Byzantine Empire -LRB- Western Armenia -RRB- and Persia -LRB- Eastern Armenia -RRB- in 387 AC .
After the collapse of Ottoman Empire Western Armenia remained under Turkish rule , and in 1894 â `` 96 and 1915 Turkey perpetrated systematic massacres and forced deportations of Armenians .
After the death of Armenian king Arshak III , in 390 AC , the Western Armenia was governed by Greek generals .
Then the Zakarid Armenia of 13-14th centuries included some parts of Western Armenia .
The fate of Western Armenia â '' commonly referred to as `` The Armenian Question '' â '' is considered as a key issue in the modern history of the Armenian people .

After Turkish-Persian wars of 1602-1639 Western Armenia became part of Ottoman Empire .
The first and second congresses of Western Armenians took place in Yerevan in 1917 and 1919 .
It differs orthographically from Eastern Armenian , there are also phonological differences .
Since Russo-Turkish War , 1828-1829 that term is referred to the Armenian-populated historical regions of the Ottoman Empire that remained under Ottoman rule after the eastern part was ceded to the Russian Empire .
Since 2000 , an organizing committee of congress of heirs of Western Armenians who survived the Armenian Genocide is active in diasporan communities .

Permanent -LRB- dedicated -RRB- : Easiest to understand , of the variations of point-to-point topology , is a point-to-point communications channel that appears , to the user , to be permanently associated with the two endpoints .
A network 's logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology . For example , twisted pair Ethernet is a logical bus topology in a physical star topology layout .
The physical topology you choose for your network depends on :
The value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers , assuming that communicating groups of any two endpoints , up to and including all the endpoints , is approximated by Reed 's Law .
This is the basic mode of conventional telephony .
This decentralization is often used to advantage to compensate for the single-point-failure disadvantage that is present when using a single device as a central node -LRB- e.g. , in star and tree networks -RRB- .
Alternatively , if the data does match the machine address , the data is accepted .
Switched point-to-point topologies are the basic model of conventional telephony .
This lookup table then allows future transmissions to be forwarded to the intended destination only .
Unlike the star network , the functionality of the central node may be distributed .
For example , twisted pair Ethernet is a logical bus topology in a physical star topology layout .
A daisy-chained network can take two basic forms : linear and ring .
Network topology is the layout of the connections -LRB- links , nodes , etc. -RRB- of a computer network .
This tree has individual peripheral nodes -LRB- e.g. leaves -RRB- which are required to transmit to and receive from one other node only and are not required to act as repeaters or regenerators .
The star topology reduces the probability of a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes -LRB- computers , etc. -RRB- to a central node . When the physical star topology is applied to a logical bus network such as Ethernet , this central node -LRB- traditionally a hub -RRB- rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network , sometimes including the originating node .
The type of network topology in which a central ` root ' node -LRB- the top level of the hierarchy -RRB- is connected to one or more other nodes that are one level lower in the hierarchy -LRB- i.e. , the second level -RRB- with a point-to-point link between each of the second level nodes and the top level central ` root ' node , while each of the second level nodes that are connected to the top level central ` root ' node will also have one or more other nodes that are one level lower in the hierarchy -LRB- i.e. , the third level -RRB- connected to it , also with a point-to-point link , the top level central ` root ' node being the only node that has no other node above it in the hierarchy -LRB- The hierarchy of the tree is symmetrical . -RRB-
This is similar in some ways to a grid network , where a linear or ring topology is used to connect systems in multiple directions .
The mapping of the nodes of a network and the physical connections between them â `` the layout of wiring , cables , the locations of nodes , and the interconnections between the nodes and the cabling or wiring system .
These are examples of physical dedicated channels .
However , there is a higher cost of managing the network .
In local area networks with a star topology , each network host -LRB- for example a PC -RRB- is connected to a central hub with a point-to-point connection .
This tree has individual peripheral nodes .
: Within many switched telecommunications systems , it is possible to establish a permanent circuit .
This topology is mostly seen in military applications .
Also known as a hierarchy network .
A multi-dimensional ring has a toroidal topology , for instance .
A hybrid topology is always produced when two different basic network topologies are connected .
An advantage of the star topology is the simplicity of adding additional nodes .
The hub acts as a signal booster or repeater .
A fully connected network , complete topology or full mesh topology is a network topology in which there is a direct link between all pairs of nodes .
One example might be a telephone in the lobby of a public building , which is programmed to ring only the number of a telephone dispatcher .
In a mesh topology -LRB- i.e. , a partially connected mesh topology -RRB- , there are at least two nodes with two or more paths between them to provide redundant paths to be used in case the link providing one of the paths fails .
The number of connections in a full mesh = n -LRB- n - 1 -RRB- \/ 2 Fully connected
: Using circuit-switching or packet-switching technologies , a point-to-point circuit can be set up dynamically , and dropped when no longer needed .
The logical classification of network topologies generally follows the same classifications as those in the physical classifications of network topologies but describes the path that the data takes between nodes being used as opposed to the actual physical connections between nodes .
The star topology reduces the probability of a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes -LRB- computers , etc. -RRB- to a central node .
In local area networks where bus topology is used , each machine is connected to a single cable .
However , it can also be seen in the file sharing protocol BitTorrent in which users connect to other users in the `` swarm '' by allowing each user sharing the file to connect to other users also involved .
A network 's logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology .
Hybrid networks use a combination of any two or more topologies in such a way that the resulting network does not exhibit one of the standard topologies -LRB- e.g. , bus , star , ring , etc. -RRB- .
This refers to how the cables are laid out to connect many computers to one network .
Two common examples for Hybrid network are : star ring network and star bus network
The simplest topology is a permanent link between two endpoints -LRB- the line in the illustration above -RRB- .
All peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to , and receiving from , the central node only .
The value of a permanent point-to-point network is the value of guaranteed , or nearly so , communications between the two endpoints .
For example , a tree network connected to a tree network is still a tree network , but two star networks connected together exhibit a hybrid network topology .
The computers on a home network can be arranged in a circle but it does not necessarily mean that it represents a ring network .
Additionally , since only one cable is used , so if that network cable breaks the entire network will be down .
If the machine address does not match the intended address for the data , the machine ignores the data .
A children 's `` tin-can telephone '' is one example , with a microphone to a single public address speaker is another .
The resources in such a connection can be released when no longer needed , for example , a television circuit from a parade route back to the studio .
A network topology that is set up in a circular fashion in which data travels around the ring in one direction and each device on the right acts as a repeater to keep the signal strong as it travels .
Physical topology means the physical design of a network including the devices , location and cable installation .
However , the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes also ,
Each device incorporates a receiver for the incoming signal and a transmitter to send the data on to the next device in the ring .
An active star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo-related problems .
Except for star-based networks , the easiest way to add more computers into a network is by daisy-chaining , or connecting each computer in series to the next .
The network is dependent on the ability of the signal to travel around the ring .
As in the conventional star network , individual nodes may thus still be isolated from the network by a single-point failure of a transmission path to the node .
In a fully connected network with n nodes , there are n -LRB- n-1 -RRB- \/ 2 direct links .
Network topologies may be physical or logical .
Logical topology refers to how data is actually transferred in a network as opposed to its physical design .
The number of arbitrary forks in mesh networks makes them more difficult to design and implement , but their decentralized nature makes them very useful .
The shape of the cabling layout used to link devices is called the physical topology of the network .
A signal from the source travels in both directions to all machines connected on the bus cable until it finds the MAC address or IP address on the network that is the intended recipient .
If the central node is passive , the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an echo of its own transmission , delayed by the two-way round trip transmission time -LRB- i.e. to and from the central node -RRB- plus any delay generated in the central node .
In order to alleviate the amount of network traffic that comes from broadcasting all signals to all nodes , more advanced central nodes were developed that are able to keep track of the identities of the nodes that are connected to the network .
The failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others , but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected .
Often in actual usage of BitTorrent any given individual node is rarely connected to every single other node as in a true fully connected network but the protocol does allow for the possibility for any one node to connect to any other node when sharing files .
If a link connecting a leaf fails , that leaf is isolated ; if a connection to a non-leaf node fails , an entire section of the network becomes isolated from the rest .
Since the bus topology consists of only one wire , it is cheap to implement compared to other topologies .
Each node in the network having a specific fixed number , of nodes connected to it at the next lower level in the hierarchy , the number , being referred to as the ` branching factor ' of the hierarchical tree .
A special kind of mesh , limiting the number of hops between two nodes , is a hypercube .
These network switches will `` learn '' the layout of the network by `` listening '' on each port during normal data transmission , examining the data packets and recording the address\/identifier of each connected node and which port it 's connected to in a lookup table held in memory .
Logical topology describes the way in which a network transmits information from network\/computer to another and not the way the network looks or how it is laid out .
The primary disadvantage of the star topology is that it may need a lot more cables , and if the hub breaks everything will stop working .
The logical layout also describes the different speeds of the cables being used from one network to another .
The star topology is considered the easiest topology to design and implement .
`` Nailing down '' a switched connection saves the cost of running a physical circuit between the two points .
While IBM 's Token Ring is a logical ring topology , it is physically set up in a star topology .
Each computer or server is connected to the single bus cable through some kind of connector .
A tree topology -LRB- a.k.a. hierarchical topology -RRB- can be viewed as a collection of star networks arranged in a hierarchy .
A terminator is required at each end of the bus cable to prevent the signal from bouncing back and forth on the bus cable .
If a message is intended for a computer partway down the line , each system bounces it along in sequence until it reaches the destination .
The logical topology , in contrast to the `` physical '' , is the way that the signals act on the network media , or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices .
When the physical star topology is applied to a logical bus network such as Ethernet , this central node -LRB- traditionally a hub -RRB- rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network , sometimes including the originating node .
The value of an on-demand point-to-point connection is proportional to the number of potential pairs of subscribers , and has been expressed as Metcalfe 's Law .
Networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive to set up , but provide a high degree of reliability due to the multiple paths for data that are provided by the large number of redundant links between nodes .
Network topology is the layout of the connections -LRB- links , nodes , etc. -RRB- of a computer network . Network topologies may be physical or logical .
All traffic on the network passes through the central hub .

Free or Zero-fare public transport services are funded in full by means other than collecting a fare from passengers .
Several mid-size European cities and many smaller towns around the world have converted their entire bus networks to zero-fare .
Public transport is also good for the environment . When people use public transport it means that there are fewer cars on the road .
Local zero-fare shuttles or inner-city loops are far more common than city-wide systems .
Another good thing about public transport is the cost . It is very cheap to catch public transport every day and lots of people like public transport better than their cars .

As man began to eat foods easier to digest , they became less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy .
The cecum is a pouch-like structure of the colon . The appendix is near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine .
In human anatomy , the appendix -LRB- other names include vermiform appendix ; cecal -LRB- or caecal -RRB- appendix ; vermix -RRB- is a blind ended tube connected to the cecum -LRB- or caecum -RRB- , from which it develops embryologically .
These alleles became more frequent and the cecum continued to shrink .
The cecum of the koala is attached to the juncture of the small and large intestines-like in humans - and is very long . This enables it to host bacteria specific for cellulose breakdown .
The cecum became less necessary for digestion and mutations that previously had been deleterious were no longer selected against .
It may be a vestigial organ of ancient man that has degraded down to nearly nothing over the course of evolution .
Early manâ s ancestor may have also relied upon this system and lived on a diet rich in foliage .
The appendix is near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine .
The term `` vermiform '' comes from Latin and means `` worm-like in appearance '' .
Evidence can be seen in herbivorous animals such as the Koala .
After thousands of years , the once-necessary cecum has degraded to what we see today ; the appendix .
Darwin suggested that the appendix was perhaps used to digest leaves as primates .
The cecum is a pouch-like structure of the colon .

Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a mezze .
Falafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas or a combination of the two .
Other variations may contain only chickpeas .
This is the case of Plaestinians , Yemenite Jews in Jerusalem as well as in Syria and Lebanon . In the Levant , Falafel is generally made only with chickpeas .
In many countries falafel is a popular street food or fast food .
The falafel balls , whole or crushed , may be topped with salads , pickled vegetables and hot sauce , and drizzled with tahini-based sauces .
During Ramadan , they are sometimes eaten as part of an iftar , the meal which breaks the daily fast after sunset .
Asher is a city of Oklahoma in the United States .
Grants of land are also awarded to individuals and companies to help develop unused land in relatively unpopulated countries .
A land grant is a gift of real estate - land or privileges - made by a government or other authority as a reward for services to an individual , especially as rewards for military service .

McMahon talked about the buyout of WCW and toyed with the idea of making WCW into a huge media conglomerate , much like the WWF .
Shane McMahon responded that he was responsible for all the events that just transpired and announced that ECW and WCW merged to form The Alliance .

Lex Luger received a negative reaction from fans , and Hulk Hogan , Buff Bagwell , Booker T , Scott Steiner , Sting , and Goldberg received positive reactions .
Vince McMahon replied that Shane was somewhat accurate in his accusations but ceded that it was wrong for him to back Stone Cold , as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him .
Ric Flair and Rey Mysterio were not signed until the end of the Invasion because they were tied to their contracts , and therefore their absence was out of the WWF 's control .
He asked the crowd who he should keep under his belt by mentioning names of WCW wrestlers and asking for a reaction .
Near the end of the match , all of the wrestlers were outside of the ring except Booker T and Angle .
In addition to this , the Stone Cold versus Vince McMahon feud was to start again when Vince McMahon hit Austin in the back of the head with a chair at No Mercy .
The WWF had effectively doubled the size of its roster through its purchase of WCW , and as a result , there was not enough screen time for everyone .
Although both WWF and WCW featured talents who had worked for both companies , wrestlers such as Stone Cold had their greatest success in WWF and were seen by fans as WWF wrestlers . Kurt Angle had never wrestled a match for either WCW or ECW , but was a main player for the Alliance towards the end of the storyline .
The WWF roster ran to the ring to the aid of Vince , but Booker T and Shane McMahon escaped through the crowd .
Others , such as Hulk Hogan , Kevin Nash , Scott Hall , and Goldberg , were not signed until well after the storyline finished .
McMahon then announced that he would sign the contract and make the purchase official at WrestleMania .
The message sent was loud and clear .
Because of this , the WWF 's opponent allegedly lacked the strong identity of WCW .
, extended an invitation to The Rock , who had not been seen since the RAW following WrestleMania X-Seven , to the Alliance .
On that same RAW , The Rock returned for the first time since his suspension on the April 2 edition of RAW .
Kurt Angle applied the ankle lock on Booker T , who tapped out , but no referee was there to witness it .
The Invasion storyline was presented with a backdrop of a McMahon feud .
The WWF wrestlers then came into the ring and , before ECW entered , the WCW and WWF wrestlers started to brawl .
The feud between Jericho and The Rock built up to a match at No Mercy on October 21 , where Jericho beat the Rock to win the WCW Championship , and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Angle and Rob Van Dam to retain his WWF Championship .
Chris Jericho came out and offered to be Kane 's partner , thus turning it into a tag team match .
For example , it took Tazz assisting Raven at InVasion for Raven to beat William Regal .
As part of its plans , Lance Storm became the first WCW wrestler to appear on WWF programming , by running in during a match on the May 28 episode of RAW while a match was being held .
One particular example of this was during the Inaugural Brawl at the InVasion pay-per-view .
At the end of the night , the WCW wrestlers came into the ring , accompanied by Shane McMahon .
The build-up to this one-shot event featured former ECW talent putting over the virtues of the brand versus the WWE product and appearances by several former ECW wrestlers not under contract to WWE .
The Invasion angle was a large storyline that spanned for almost half of 2001 and brought about financial success for the WWF , such as the InVasion pay-per-view being one of the highest non-major event buyrates in the history of pay-per-views .
Also that night , Kurt Angle challenged Booker T to a WCW World Heavyweight Championship match , which Booker T accepted .
Also that night , Stone Cold and Kurt Angle faced off for the WWF Championship , and William Regal , who sat at ringside to ensure a fair match would take place , hit Kurt Angle with the championship , thereby backstabbing the WWF and costing Angle the title .
Polls were even put up on WWF.com and WCW.com to decide the name of the new show .
Stone Cold came out to confront Vince about it , and Vince stated that Stone Cold would be the one to defect .
After The Alliance was disbanded , the WCW World Heavyweight Championship would be simply renamed the World Championship , and later unified with the WWF Championship to form the WWF Undisputed Championship .
The Rock , however , Rock Bottomed Vince McMahon and proceeded to shake Shane 's hand , but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well .
Vince agreed but insisted that WCW would eventually meet its demise when all was said and done .
For fans who did n't catch it the fifth , tenth or twentieth time they 've run the angle , `` Stone Cold '' Steve Austin and Vince McMahon are about to feud once again ... First up was Vincent McMahon labeling Austin with a steel chair as he was waiting to put a dazed RVD away ... Three minutes later , it was Shane McMahon 's turn to hurl Kurt Angle out of the ring and into a steel ring post .
After a brief stand-off , the WWF group turned around and attacked Kane and Jericho .
The original plan was to find a time slot on TNN to continue running WCW as a separate entity .
Austin complied and gave him a shot at the upcoming pay-per-view , Unforgiven .
Kurt Angle had never wrestled a match for either WCW or ECW , but was a main player for the Alliance towards the end of the storyline .
He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself , stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF .
It has been speculated that the reason for this was because Vince McMahon did not want the WWF to look weak while fighting the Alliance , as he worked very hard to put down his competition , especially WCW .
The WWF gained momentum when Angle beat Booker T with an ankle lock , taking the WCW Championship away from the Alliance .
Shane McMahon took the liberty of reminding The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier that year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania .
Furthermore , a crucial plot point formed when , on the October 8 airing of RAW , Jericho and The Rock teamed up against Shane McMahon and Rob Van Dam .
In 2006 , it was announced that WWE would be reviving ECW as its third `` brand '' -LRB- to complement RAW and SmackDown ! -RRB- .
Because of this announcement , many Alliance members began to distrust Stone Cold , looking at him with suspicious eyes , to which Stone Cold denied the charges and called Vince a liar .
Besides Austin 's turn in the match that was needed to secure a WCW\/ECW win over the WWF , Slam !
The Undisputed Championship was originally represented with both the original WWF and WCW title belts , as the champion would carry both belts around , until being replaced with a single belt .
Vince McMahon opened up Nitro and announced a simulcast later that night to address the future of WCW .
Austin stole Kurt Angle 's medals during one of the shows , and on the August 30 edition of SmackDown !
The Rock followed this with a Rock Bottom and a pin on Austin , to which the referee woke up and counted Austin down to three .
It has been argued that the Invasion angle may have been more successful if Paul Heyman and Eric Bischoff were perceived as controlling ECW and WCW , respectively , instead of Stephanie and Shane McMahon .
Austin approached the downed referee to try to revive him .
However , the Invasion storyline has come under criticism by wrestling fans and wrestling media , with the storyline being called a flop .
The next night , a confrontation occurred between WCW owner Shane McMahon and WWF owner Vince McMahon .
As this was occurring , Angle ran to the ring , picked up the WWF championship belt , and nailed Austin with it , revealing himself to be the defector to which McMahon was referring the entire time .
, Angle , who originally led the WWF wrestlers , explained that he represented what is great about America -- he was a winner , and his defection came from his decision to fight along the winning side .
until then champion Brock Lesnar took the title to Smackdown .
On the November 1 edition of SmackDown !
This prompted Paul Heyman to leave the announce table and enter the ring .
The Rock and Austin continued to battle it out , and the referee was knocked down in the match .
Many fans had dreamed of a day where they could pit WWF and WCW wrestlers against each other , but the storyline 's final match ended with four WWF wrestlers brawling it out .
Throughout the storyline , many inter-promotional matches had WWF wrestlers winning over WCW\/ECW wrestlers , usually cleanly .
The idea of a match showing the top 2 shows of the Monday Night Wars was considered to be a `` dream match '' show in the eyes of many fans , because it let fans to see which show would be superior .
`` Portrayed as disorganized and inferior grapplers , the ECW-WCW Team had more than its fair share of mistimed moves which hurt their own team members while the `` WWF squad '' of course wrestled like a well-oiled machines .
After high-fiving the wrestlers , he announced that ECW has been brought into the Invasion .
Back in the ring , Austin laid a `` Stone Cold '' Stunner on to retain the belt as a disgruntled Vince scowled .
The final three men in the match were The Rock and Jericho vs. Austin .
Angle said , however , that Austin was `` still going into the water '' , but instead simply embarrassed Austin by throwing him into a kiddie pool . .
Additionally , the WCW United States Championship was revived in 2003 as a SmackDown !
Shane McMahon , however , appeared on Nitro and announced that he had signed the contract and purchased WCW out from under his father 's nose , planting the seed for what was considered a lucrative future storyline opportunity .
As the move was being applied , however , Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer ran through the audience and into the ring and started to beat on Kane and Jericho .
Paul Heyman and Shane McMahon then hugged and started to dismantle the WWF wrestlers .
He suggested that he would take five of his WCW wrestlers and have them team up with five of Vince McMahon 's WWF wrestler 's later that night to take out ECW .
An Inaugural Brawl took place at the WWF Invasion pay-per-view , where Stone Cold Steve Austin defected and joined the Alliance .
After Sting defeated Ric Flair in WCW 's final match , the simulcast began .
Jericho was eliminated and , to continue the feud between the two men , attacked the Rock , even though Jericho 's future was on the line if The Rock lost .
`` While it was good TV , it was n't what everyone thought the WCW vs WWF would have been all about ... When the fans of WWF and WCW reminisced about a WCW vs WWF match back in the glory days of Monday Night Wars of around 1997 , their match would have probably gone like this : WCW would probably have a team of Hollywood Hulk Hogan , Scott Hall , Kevin Nash , Goldberg , and Ric Flair against ... maybe the WWF team of Stone Cold Steve Austin , The Rock , the Undertaker , Shawn Michaels , and Mick Foley .
In addition , Scott Steiner was recovering from an injury .
Gee , how many times have we seen that scenario play itself out before ?
After this , WCW 's men came into the ring and high-fived the ECW men .
The second One Night Stand , held on June 11 2006 , led to the official debut of the new ECW the following Tuesday .
showings featured primarily inter-promotional matches between the two companies .
Stone Cold went on to interrogate members of Team Alliance , questioning Booker T and sitting Rob Van Dam down in a room with a light shining on him .
The WWF consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin , Kurt Angle , Chris Jericho , Kane , and the Undertaker , who all wrestled against the team of DDP , Booker T , Rhyno , and the Dudley Boys .
The WWF eventually began to recognize WCW and tested the idea of a brand extension by giving WCW the final twenty minutes of RAW with Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson doing announcing duties in place of Jim Ross and Paul Heyman .
Later that same night , Kurt Angle backstabbed the WWF by hitting Jericho , The Rock , Undertaker , and Kane with steel chairs .
Although the feud did not center completely around the McMahons , the family feud storyline had been done many times before .
The WWF gained even more momentum at Unforgiven , as The Rock retained the WCW Championship against Booker T , and Kurt Angle made Austin submit to the ankle lock , winning the WWF Championship from Stone Cold , putting both belts into the hands of the WWF .
On the October 29 edition of RAW , Shane McMahon told his father , Vince McMahon , that a member of the WWF would jump ship to the Alliance that night .
The storyline also allegedly centered too much on the McMahons , who were getting more airtime than the wrestlers .
Many of WCW 's top wrestlers had contracts with AOL Time Warner , WCW 's parent company , and were willing to sit at home rather than wrestle for less money .
Several top WCW and ECW talent who were top superstars in their previous company such as Diamond Dallas Page , Justin Credible , Raven and Tazz were put down into low-mid card matches , while lesser-ranked WWF wrestlers who defected to the Alliance , such as Test , were given a greater push .
Shane told his father that ECW needed to be taken care of and pointed out that there were 10 ECW wrestlers under Heyman 's belt .
The following RAW , Debra and Stephanie bought a new truck for Stone Cold , but Angle came up from behind and nailed Austin in the back of the head with a pipe .
There were several inter-promotional matches after Unforgiven .
As stated by a Slam !
Vince then proceeded to fire them all , however , to the cheers of the RAW crowd and the jeers of the Nitro crowd .
The storyline began when Vince McMahon 's son , Shane McMahon , said on RAW that he bought WCW .
Another WCW championship , the WCW Cruiserweight Championship , was rebranded as a WWE title and replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship as the WWE Cruiserweight Championship .
In contrast , most of the Alliance 's wins were due to interference or disqualification .
The weakening of the ECW-WCW dubbed superstars did n't stop there either .
In storyline , WWF was owned by Vince McMahon , WCW was owned by Shane McMahon , and ECW was owned by Stephanie McMahon .
Vince McMahon , stunned , came out and asked what was going on .

The Siberian Traps form a large region of volcanic rock , known as a large igneous province , in the Russian region of Siberia .
The Siberian Traps are considered to have erupted through numerous vents over a period of a million years or more , probably east and south of Norilsk in Siberia .
Life on land took 30 million years to recover from the environmental disruptions caused by the eruption of the Siberian Traps .
The eruption of the Siberian Traps is a possible cause of this `` Great Dying '' .
The original volume of lava is estimated to range from 1 to 4 million kmÂ .
The massive eruptions which formed the traps were one of the largest known volcanic events of the last 500 million years of Earth history . They continued for a million years and spanned the Permian-Triassic boundary , about 251 to 250 million years ago .
The presence of extensive tuff and pyroclastic deposits suggests that a number of large explosive eruptions occurred during or before the eruptions of basaltic lavas .

Trajan -LRB- Marcus Ulpius Nerva Traianus , 18 September 53 â `` 9 August 117 -RRB- was Roman Emperor from 98 to 117 .
Nerva died on 27 January 98 , and was succeeded by Trajan without incident .
As a civilian administrator , Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program which reshaped the city of Rome and left multiple enduring landmarks such as Trajan 's Forum , Trajan 's Market and Trajan 's Column .
In late 117 , while sailing back to Rome , Trajan fell ill and died of a stroke in the city of Selinus .
After a brief and tumultuous year in power , a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard compelled him to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor .
Every new emperor after him was honored by the Senate with the prayer felicior Augusto , melior Traiano , meaning `` may he be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan '' .
Among medieval Christian theologians , Trajan was considered a `` virtuous pagan '' , while the 18th century historian Edward Gibbon popularized the notion of the Five Good Emperors , of which Trajan was the second .
As an emperor , Trajan 's reputation has endured â '' he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries .
He was deified by the Senate , and succeeded by his adopted son Hadrian .
In September 96 , Domitian was succeeded by Nerva , an old and childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army .

Galileo refused to use Marius 's names and invented the numbering scheme that is still used nowadays , in parallel with proper moon names .
Galileo Galilei found what came to be known as the Galilean moons around December 1609 or January 1610 .
Other names put forward , but the names which eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius . Marius claimed to have found the moons at the same time as Galileo : he named them after lovers of the god Zeus -LRB- the Greek equivalent of Jupiter -RRB- : Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto , in his Mundus Jovialis , published in 1614 .
Galileo 's Sidereus Nuncius -LRB- Starry Messenger -RRB- , which announced celestial observations through his telescope , does not mention Copernican heliocentrism , a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe .
He continued to look at them from January 8 through March 2 .
Galileo called his discovery the Cosmica Sidera -LRB- ` Cosimo 's stars ' -RRB- , in honor of Cosimo II de ' Medici -LRB- 1590 -- 1621 -RRB- , grand-duke of Tuscany , whose patronage he wanted .
They have apparent magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun , and about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction .
Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it .
Ganymede and Callisto , at their maximum separation , are the likeliest targets for possible naked-eye observation .
More importantly , the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than the Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system . This held that the Earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it .
At the time , he only saw three of them , and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter .
As a result of improvements he made to the telescope , Galileo was able to see celestial bodies better than ever before in human history .
Nevertheless , Galileo believed in the Copernican theory .
Galileo also developed a method of determining longitude based on the timing of the orbits of the Galilean moons .
On January 7 , 1610 , Galileo wrote a letter containing the first mention of Jupiterâ s moons .
Their maximum angular separations from Jupiter are between 2 and 8 minutes of arc , close to the limit of human visual acuity .
The numbers run from Jupiter outward , thus I , II , III and IV for Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto respectively .
At the grand-duke 's suggestion , Galileo changed the name to Medicea Sidera -LRB- ` the Medici stars ' -RRB- , honoring all four Medici brothers -LRB- Cosimo , Francesco , Carlo , and Lorenzo -RRB- .
Galileoâ s discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers . It showed there were objects in space to be found , which were not seen by the naked eye .
All four Galilean moons are bright enough that they could , if they were farther away from Jupiter , be seen without a telescope .
This suggests that the population of the herbivore fluctuates around the carrying capacity of the food source , in this case the plant .
There will always be pockets of plants not found by herbivores .
Alternating between two or more plant types provides population stability for the herbivore , while the populations of the plants oscillate .
When an invasive herbivore or plant enters the system , the balance is thrown off and the diversity can change or even collapse .
Eating a second plant type helps herbivoresâ populations stabilize .
The prey population eventually recovers , starting a new cycle .
When prey -LRB- plants -RRB- are numerous their predators -LRB- herbivores -RRB- increase in numbers , reducing the plant population , which in turn causes herbivore number to decline .
According to the theory of predator-prey interactions , the relationship between herbivores and plants is cyclic .
This is especially important role for specialist herbivores that feeds on one by one species of plant : it prevents these specialists from wiping out their food source .

Xenophanes is quoted , memorably , in Clement of Alexandria , arguing against the conception of gods as fundamentally anthropomorphic : But if cattle and horses and lions had handsor could paint with their hands and create works such as men do , horses like horses and cattle like cattlealso would depict the gods ' shapes and make their bodiesof such a sort as the form they themselves have ... Ethiopians say that their gods are snubnosed and blackThracians that they are pale and red-haired .
Xenophanes of Colophon , c. 570 â `` c. 475 BC , was a Greek philosopher , poet , and social and religious critic .
Xenophanes ' surviving writings display a skepticism that became more commonly expressed during the 4th century BC .
He satirized the polytheistic beliefs of earlier Greek poets and of his own contemporaries . `` Homer and Hesiod '' one fragment states , `` have attributed to the gods all sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among men : theft , adultery , and mutual deception '' .
Sextus Empiricus reported that such ideas were savored by Christian apologists .
To judge from these , his poetry criticized and satirized a wide range of ideas . This included Homer and Hesiod , the belief in the pantheon of anthropomorphic gods and the Greeks ' veneration of athleticism .
Our knowledge of his views comes from fragments of his poetry , surviving as quotations by later Greek writers .

GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF 's efforts during this period .
The FSF holds the copyrights on many important pieces of the GNU system , such as the GCC .
As a copyright holder , it has the power to enforce the GNU General Public License -LRB- GPL -RRB- when copyright infringement occurs on that software .
The organization created the GNU operating system as an example of this .
The FSF says these projects are `` important because computer users are continually being seduced into using non-free software , because there is no adequate free replacement . ''
; Maintaining the Free Software Definition : FSF maintains many of the documents that define the free software movement .
; The GNU project : The original purpose of the FSF was to promote the ideals of free software .
From its founding -LRB- when it started -RRB- until the 1990s , FSF 's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write free software for the GNU Project .
While other copyright holders of other software systems used the GPL as their license , FSF was the only organization to regularly assert its copyright interests on software licensed under the GPL until Harald Welte created gpl-violations .
They sponsor also some free software projects that are deemed to be `` high-priority '' .
They also have a campaign to promote Ogg + Vorbis , a free alternative to proprietary formats like MP3 and AAC .
The Free Software Foundation -LRB- FSF -RRB- is a non-profit corporation founded by Richard Stallman on 4 October 1985 to support the free software movement , a copyleft-based movement which tries to promote the universal freedom to distribute and modify computer software without restriction .

When Jolene became pregnant with Jack , she , in desperate need of money , had her embryo surgically removed and sold it to the highest bidder .
Because Jack was Ryan 's son , he could freely use Rapture 's bathysphere network , which had been locked out to everyone except those within Ryan 's `` genetic ballpark '' .
A drawback of ADAM is that a user must take regular infusions or suffer mental and physical problems .
When the conflict between Fontaine and Ryan reached a stalemate , Jack was sent instructions to board a flight with a package and to use its contents , a revolver , to hijack and crash the plane near the lighthouse , enabling him to return to Rapture as a tool of Fontaine .
Ryan in turn began splicing his own forces , and his paranoia had reached such a level he was hanging dozens of people , mostly innocent , in Rapture 's main square .
Frank Fontaine created charity organizations to support the underclass .
Scientists also made ADAM , stem cells harvested from an unknown species of sea slug , which were discovered by Dr. Bridgette Tenenbaum to have the ability to heal damaged tissue and rewrite the human genome .
These , along with his control of the plasmid industry , made him immensely powerful .
An Irishman named Atlas uses the service radio found in the bathysphere to help Jack in making his way to safety .
In order to solve ADAM shortages , the Little Sisters were mentally conditioned to wander the city and extract ADAM from the dead , recycling it into raw ADAM in their stomachs after swallowing it .
Three endings are possible depending on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters , all narrated by Dr. Tenenbaum .
The Splicers kill all hands aboard the submarine and take control of it .
Tenenbaum narrates what occurred , angry Jack and his actions , voice thick with anger .
She had not realized it was Frank Fontaine who purchased the son , leading to her death by an angry Ryan .
Later in the second ending , a George Washington-class submarine carrying nuclear missiles comes across the wreckage of the plane and is suddenly surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers .
Ryan further reveals that , after purchasing Jack 's embryo , Fontaine made him to obey orders when he is told `` Would you kindly ... '' Jack was then sent to the surface when the war started to put him beyond Ryan 's reach .
If the player harvested no Little Sisters -LRB- thereby saving their lives -RRB- , the ending shows five Little Sisters returning to the surface with Jack and living full lives under his care , including their graduating from college , getting married , and having children ; it ends on a heart-warming tone , with an elderly Jack surrounded on his deathbed by all five of the adult Little Sisters .
If the player harvested -LRB- and thereby killed -RRB- all or almost all of the Little Sisters , the game ends with Jack turning on the Sisters after defeating Fontaine , presumably killing them all and taking their ADAM .
BioShock is set during 1960 , in Rapture , a fictional underwater city .
Eventually , after completing tasks like saving an artificial forest from dying and helping an insane artist build his sculpture , Jack confronts Ryan in his office , who is playing golf .
Meanwhile , Ryan , believing Jack to be an agent of a surface nation , uses Rapture 's automated systems and his pheromone-controlled Splicers to try to kill Jack .
Fontaine , having been cornered , injects himself with huge amounts of ADAM and becomes an monster .
Ryan reveals a truth that he has pieced together .
When it becomes clear to Fontaine that he is losing control of Jack , Fontaine points out the fact that Tenenbaum has survived both World War II as a Holocaust victim and the battle in Rapture , hinting that she has a secret agenda of her own .
Finally , Ryan has Jack kill him , wanting to die on his own terms .
Jack battles Fontaine , eventually beating and allowing the Little Sisters to take the ADAM from Fontaine , killing him .
At the start of the game , player-character Jack is a passenger on a plane that goes down in the Atlantic Ocean in 1960 , after ordered society in Rapture has collapsed .
He is Ryan 's illegitimate son by an affair with Jasmine Jolene , a dancer .
His goal was to use his charity organizations to manipulate the poor .
As time passed , the gap between rich and poor increased .
Just as Jack and Atlas reach the bay where it is located , Ryan has it destroyed ; an angry Atlas asks Jack to kill Ryan .
When Jack awakens , Dr. Tenenbaum has already turned off the trigger phrase .
He tried to overthrow Ryan , but the revolt was violently crushed and Fontaine was said to be dead .
Within a few months , a new figure named Atlas rose as the leader of the disgruntled lower class .
After surfacing , Jack finds himself the only survivor of the crash , and swims to a nearby lighthouse on an island , where he finds a bathysphere which he uses to sink into the ocean and enter the city of Rapture .
With the help of the Little Sisters , Jack is able to track down Fontaine .
He also made a smuggling operation to supply citizens with forbidden items from the surface , such as religious material .
The city was secretly built in 1946 on a mid-Atlantic seabed , using submarine volcanoes to give geothermal power .
As the war hurt production and supply , every ADAM user in the city went violently insane .
`` Big Daddies '' , enhanced and mentally sterilized humans in armored diving suits , were created by Dr. Suchong , the scientist behind many plasmids , to protect the Little Sisters in their work .
Overhearing Atlas ' words , Dr. Tenenbaum intercepts Jack , and urges him to save the Little Sisters instead , giving him a plasmid that will displace the embedded sea slugs in each Sister .
Ryan seized control of Fontaine 's plasmid business .
Atlas says his wife and child have been hiding on a submarine and directs Jack towards it .
With Ryan 's death , Jack realizes too late that Atlas has also been using the trigger phrase to control him .
Scientific progress grew in Rapture , leading to fast developments in engineering and biotechnology thanks in part to the brilliant scientists that Ryan brought to the city .
Atlas tells Jack that the only way he can survive is to use the abilities granted by plasmids , and that he must kill the Little Sisters to extract their ADAM .
On New Year 's Eve of 1959 , Atlas and his ADAM-infused followers began a new revolt against Ryan that spread throughout Rapture .
Tenenbaum joined with businessman and mobster Frank Fontaine to create the plasmid industry , which offered superhuman physical enhancements to its customers .
Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine , who faked his death to throw Ryan off his trail and take control of the city , leaving Jack at the mercy of the reactivated security systems .

Still , the clarinet in B-flat is often used for music in D major .
D major is a major scale based on D. Its key signature has two sharps .
However , when some composers write a piece in D minor with B-flat clarinets , they change to clarinets in A if the music changes to D major .
Scriabin saw D major as golden in color and when he talked to Rimsky-Korsakov , he gave an example from one of Rimsky-Korsakov 's own operas where a character sang in D major about gold .
Its relative minor is B minor .
23 of Haydn 's 104 symphonies are in D major , making it the most often used main key of his symphonies .
The symphony came from the overture , and `` D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century . ''
Most tin whistles are in D , because they are often used in music with fiddles .
After the valve trumpet was invented , composers began to write for trumpet in keys with more flats , so Haydn wrote his famous trumpet concerto in the key of E-flat major .
For some beginning wind instrument students , however , D major is not a very good key , because it transposes to E major for B flat instruments .
D major is good for violin music because of the structure of the instrument , which has its four strings tuned to G D A E. The open strings resonate with the D string , producing a special rich sound .
It is also suitable for guitar music , with drop tuning for the lowest string making two Ds as open strings .
Because of this , many classical composers chose to write violin concertos in D major . Examples include Mozart 's -LRB- No. 2 , 1775 , No. 4 , 1775 -RRB- ; Ludwig van Beethoven 's -LRB- 1806 -RRB- ; Paganini 's -LRB- No. 1 , 1817 -RRB- ; Brahms 's -LRB- 1878 -RRB- ; Tchaikovsky 's -LRB- 1878 -RRB- ; Prokofiev 's -LRB- No. 1 , 1917 -RRB- ; Stravinsky 's -LRB- 1931 -RRB- ; and Korngold 's -LRB- 1945 -RRB- .
In the Baroque period , D major was seen as `` the key of glory '' ; so many trumpet pieces were in D major . Examples include concertos by Fasch , Gross , Molter -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- , Leopold Mozart , Telemann -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- , and Giuseppe Torelli ; sonatas by Corelli , Franceschini , Purcell , Torelli ; and `` The Trumpet Shall Sound '' and the `` Hallelujah '' chorus from Handel 's Messiah .
A great number of Mozart 's unnumbered symphonies are in D major , namely K. 66c , 81\/73 , 97\/73m , 95\/73n , 120\/111a and 161\/163\/141a .

Dyes also have side effects which lakes do not , including the fact that large amounts of dyes ingested can color stools .
A growing number of natural food dyes are being commercially produced , partly due to consumer concerns surrounding synthetic dyes .
An example would be to add red coloring to glacÃ cherries . Without coloring , the cherries would be beige .
For this reason , food manufacturers add dyes to their products .
In the past , research has not shown any link between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and food dyes . Newer studies show that synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents can make the syptoms of ADD and ADHD worse .
In the United States , certifiable color additives are available for use in food as either `` dyes '' or `` lakes '' .
Food colorings need to be tested before they can be used .
Lakes are more stable than dyes and are ideal for coloring products containing fats and oils or items lacking sufficient moisture to dissolve dyes .
Most other countries have their own regulations and list of food colors which can be used in various applications , including maximum daily intake limits .
Food colorings can be used to dye fabric , but are usually not wash-fast when used on cotton , hemp and other plant fibers .
In the United States , FD&C -LRB- generally indicates that the FDA has approved the colorant for use in Foods , Drugs and Cosmetics -RRB- numbers are given to approved synthetic food dyes that do not exist in nature . In the European Union , E numbers are used for all additives , both synthetic and natural , that are approved in food applications .
Natural colors are not required to be tested by a number of regulatory bodies throughout the world , including the United States FDA .
Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in cooking at home .
Dyes dissolve in water , but are not soluble in oil .
A food coloring is any substance that is added to food or drink to change its color .
Some examples include :
Lakes tint by dispersion .
People associate certain colors with certain flavors . The color of the food can therefore influence its perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine .
They can be used in drinks , dry mixes , baked goods , confections , dairy products , pet foods and many other products .
Some food dyes can be fixed on Nylon and animal fibers .
Typical uses include coated tablets , cake and donut mixes , hard candies and chewing gums , lipsticks , soaps , shampoos , talc etc.
Lakes are the combination of dyes and insoluble material .
Parents ' reports of food additives proved to be better indicators whether additives were present than clinical tests .
Most people are aware that food with bright or unnatural colors , such as the green ketchup mentioned , contains food coloring . Far fewer people know that `` natural '' foods such as oranges and salmon may also be dyed to hide natural variations in color .
Because food dyes are generally safer to use than normal artistic dyes and pigments , some artists have used food coloring as a means of making pictures , especially in forms such as body-painting .
Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non-ADD student populations when artificial ingredients and artificial coloring were eliminated from school food programs .
Some of the main reasons are :
Dyes are manufactured as powders , granules , liquids or other special purpose forms .
The FDA lists `` color additives exempt from certification '' for food .
Lakes are not oil soluble , but are oil dispersible .

The first fifteen asteroids to be found were given symbols by astronomers as a type of short-hand notation .
16 Psyche is a very big Main belt asteroid , well over 200 kilometers in diameter , and likely the biggest of the metallic M-type asteroids .
Recent lightcurve analysis indicates that its pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates -LRB- Î , Î '' -RRB- = -LRB- -9 Â , 35 Â -RRB- or -LRB- Î , Î '' -RRB- = -LRB- -2 Â , 215 Â -RRB- with a 10 Â uncertainty .
Psyche appears to have a fairly round surface and is approximately ellipsoidal in shape .
In 1851 , however , J. F. Encke suggested using a circled number .
Radar observations indicate that it is made of iron-nickel .
16 Psyche was the first new asteroid to be found that was designated with this scheme -LRB- in 1852 by J. Ferguson -RRB- .
Psyche appears to be a case of an exposed metallic core from a bigger differentiated parent body .
Lightcurve changes indicate a non-spherical body , consistent with the lightcurve and radar results .
Unlike some other M-type asteroids , Psyche shows no sign of the presence of water or water-bearing minerals on its surface , consistent with its interpretation as a metallic body .
One theory is that the collision occurred very early in the solar system 's history , and all the other remnants have since been ground into fragments by subsequent collisions or had their orbits perturbed beyond recognition .
This asteroid was found by Annibale de Gasparis on March 17 , 1852 from Naples and named after the Greek nymph Psyche .
Small amounts of pyroxene appear to be present .
Psyche does not belong to any asteroid family .
Two stellar occultations by Psyche have been seen -LRB- from Mexico on March 22 , 2002 , and another on May 16 , 2002 -RRB- .
If Psyche is the core remnant of a bigger parent body , we might expect other asteroids on similar orbits .
This gives an axial tilt of 95 Â .

The magnitude of an earthquake , and the intensity of shaking , is measured on a numerical scale .
Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened .
Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other .
They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock , therefore none have notable higher magnitudes than the other .
Most earthquakes form part of a sequence , related to each other in terms of location and time .
There are three main types of fault that may cause an earthquake : normal , reverse -LRB- thrust -RRB- and strike-slip .
Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended .
Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault , these storms occur over the course of years , and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones .

Many CRs have altars and shrines to the spirits and deities they believe in . They may place these altars at outdoor , natural locations such as wells , streams , and special trees .
Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism , which is sometimes just called by its initials , `` CR '' , is a religion .
Some CRs practice divination , such as the taking of omens from the shapes of clouds or the behavior of birds and animals .
CR ritual structures are based on the ancient Celtic idea of the `` Three Realms '' - Land , Sea and Sky - with the fire of inspiration seen as a central , uniting force .
In the late 1990 's , members of Imbas , a Celtic Reconstructionist group in Seattle , began promoting the name Senistrognata , which they say means `` the ancestral customs of the Celtic peoples '' in reconstructed Old Celtic .
Celtic Reconstructionists rely on primary mythological texts , as well as surviving folklore , for the basis of their religious practices .
While Celtic Reconstructionism was the earliest name in use , and is still used the most often , other names for a Celtic Reconstructionist approach have also come into use , with varying degrees of success .
The first person to write about being a `` Celtic Reconstructionist Pagan '' was Kym Lambert nÃ Dhoireann . She wrote this in the Spring , 1992 issue of Harvest Magazine .
She says she got the idea for the name from Kathryn Price NicDhÃ na , who had also written about it . Margot Adler 's 1979 book , Drawing Down the Moon has a chapter on `` Pagan Reconstructionists '' , and Kathryn NicDhÃ na says this is probably where she got the idea , even though the book does not mention Celtic Reconstructionists , just other kinds .
Community rituals are usually based on traditional community celebrations found in folkloric collections by authors such as Marian McNeill , Kevin Danaher or John Gregorson Campbell .
No list can completely cover all the recommended works , but this is a small sample of sources used .
Celtic Reconstructionists base their religion on what we know of the Ancient Celtic people 's religion , and also on Celtic folklore . They focus on a particular Celtic culture , such as the Gaelic Welsh or Gaulish .
More formal or mystical CR rituals are often based on traditional techniques of interacting with the Otherworld , such as the act of making offerings of food , drink and art to the spirits of the land , ancestral spirits , and the Celtic deities .
There are groups who now described their traditions as PÃ ganachd -LRB- `` Paganism , Heathenism '' in Scottish Gaelic -RRB- or the Irish version , PÃ gÃ nacht .
Some Gaelic-oriented groups use the two terms somewhat interchangeably , or further modify these terms to describe the CR sub-tradition practiced by their particular group , such as PÃ ganachd Allaidh -LRB- â Wild Paganismâ -RRB- or PÃ ganachd Bhandia -LRB- â Paganism of Goddessesâ -RRB- , both used by Gaelic Reconstructionist groups on the East Coast of the US .
These celebrations often involve bonfires , dances , songs , divination and children 's games .

Actress Lucy Lawless has been quoted in several interviews as saying she would be interested in participating in a Xena film as well .
Xena has enjoyed a particular cult status in the lesbian community .
Although the show often addresses ethical dilemmas such as the morality of pacifism , the storylines rarely seek to provide unequivocal solutions .
It was one of the first shows to tap into its internet following , allowing for fans from all over the world to discuss and suggest things related to the show .
Xena Warrior Princess and Hercules : The Legendary Journeys were filmed in New Zealand .
The issue of the true nature of the Xena\/Gabrielle relationship caused intense shipping debates in the fandom , which turned especially impassioned due to spillover from real-life debates about same-sex sexuality and gay rights .
The theme music , composed by Joseph LoDuca , who also co-wrote the lyrics for the songs in `` The Bitter Suite '' , was developed from the traditional Bulgarian folk song `` Kaval Sviri '' , and was sung by Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares .
Later , there were co-executive producers . They were Sam Raimi and R. J. Stewart .
The earliest ones were released by Dark Horse Comics and written by Ian Edginton and John Wagner .
The term originated in Xena : Warrior Princess fandom .
The series tells the story of Xena 's quest to seek redemption for her past sins as a ruthless warlord . She uses her fighting skills to help people .
In an interview the same year with Smithsonian magazine , she was asked the question `` Was the Warrior Princess outfit comfortable ? ''
Historical figures and events from a number of different historical eras and myths make numerous appearances , and the main characters are often credited with resolving important historical situations .
There have been a number of comic adaptations .
Although it is ostensibly set in ancient times , the themes of the show are essentially modern : taking responsibility for past misdeeds , the value of human life , personal liberty and sacrifice , and friendship .
Since the end of the series rumors have circulated that a feature length movie was in the works .
Gabrielle -LRB- Renee O'Connor -RRB- becomes Xena 's greatest friend , her initial naive helps to balance Xena and helps her in seeing and fighting for the greater good . .
It also launched the The Official Guide to the Xenaverse , by Robert Weisbrot , with photographs in color and black and white , a complete and detailed episode guide to the first two seasons , a look behind the scenes , the intriguing story of the origin of Xena : Warrior Princess , biographies of cast and crew and trivias about the show .
, she instructs the reader on fighting without traditional weapons , such as a sword or a staff , and in another , `` Nobody likes a winer '' , she laments on the perils of alcohol .
A subject of much interest and debate among viewers is the question of whether Xena and Gabrielle are lovers .
In the Hercules : The Legendary Journeys episode , `` Unchained Heart '' , in which Xena is introduced , the original `` Kaval Sviri '' is the music used to announce Xena racing into battle .
Xena and Gabrielle have supporting roles in the movie , and at one point Xena even bursts into song .
Xena : Warrior Princess is an Emmy Award-winning American cult television series . It was first shown from September 15 1995 until June 18 2001 .
This quirky mix of timelines and the amalgamation of historical and mythological elements fueled the rise of the show to cult status during the 1990s and early 2000s .
Many fans felt the term slash fiction carried the connotation of being about male\/male couples only and was not a good description for romantic fan fiction about Xena and Gabrielle .
The series has received attention in fandom -LRB- Uberfic -RRB- , and has influenced the direction of other television series .
The show freely borrows names and themes from various mythologies around the world , primarily the Greek , anachronistically adapting them to suit the demands of the storyline .
In 2003 Screenwriter Katherine Fugate was approached for the project , and was quoted saying that she expects the start of production to be three to five years away , which suggests a release sometime between 2006 and 2009 .
For example , in one of the chapters , `` Anything can be a weapon - Anything ! ''
Finally , Lucy Lawless was cast as Xena and Gabrielle was played by the American actress Renee O'Connor .
Of course some places are confidential , but many scenes were recorded in places as spectacular in Waitakere Ranges Regional Park , part of the Auckland Regional parks often credited at the end of the episodes .
In 2006 , Lucy Lawless donated her personal Xena costume to the Museum of American History .
Xena : Warrior Princess has been credited by many , including Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon , with blazing the trail for a new generation of female action heroes such as Buffy , Max of Dark Angel , Sydney Bristow of Alias , and the Bride in Quentin Tarantino 's Kill Bill .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been nicknamed `` Warrior Princess '' by her staff .
Uberfic is a kind of alternative universe fan fiction in which characters or events are portrayed somewhat closely to original canon but usually in a different time period , many times featuring the ancestors , descendants or reincarnations of canon characters .
Now it was n't just that Xena was bisexual and kinda liked her gal pal and they kind of fooled around sometimes , it was ` Nope , they 're married , man ' . ''
Some fans felt that the sexual nature of Xena and Gabrielle 's relationship was cemented by an interview given by Lucy Lawless to Lesbian News magazine in 2003 .
More recently the license has moved to Dynamite Entertainment .
A book was also released in 1998 , XENA : All I Need to Know I Learned From the Warrior Princess , allegedly written by Gabrielle , Bard of Poteidaia , and was `` translated '' by Josepha Sherman .
The show is a mixture of styles , ranging from high melodrama in one episode to slapstick comedy in another , from whimsical to all-out action and adventure in another .
The Xena fandom also popularized the term Altfic -LRB- from `` alternative fiction '' -RRB- to refer to same-sex romantic fan fiction .
These include an encounter with Homer , before he was famous , in which Gabrielle encourages his storytelling aspirations ; the fall of Troy ; and the capture of Caesar by pirates , with Xena cast as the pirate leader .
and she responded :
Jokes , innuendo , and other subtle evidence of a romantic relationship between Xena and Gabrielle is referred to as `` lesbian subtext '' or simply `` subtext '' by fans .
Lawless stated that after the series finale , where Gabrielle revives Xena with a mouth-to-mouth water transfer filmed to look like a full kiss , she had come to believe that Xena and Gabrielle 's relationship was `` definitely gay ... there was always a ` well , she might be or she might not be ' but when there was that drip of water passing between their lips in the very final scene , that cemented it for me .
A group called The Marching Xenas has participated in many gay and lesbian pride parades .
The movie plot involves Hercules ' mother being kidnapped by Zeus and the release of the Titans .
Xena : Warrior Princess has been referred to as a pop cultural phenomenon and feminist icon .
Some of the lesbian fan base sees Xena and Gabrielle as a couple and has embraced them as role models and lesbian icons .
There have been numerous Xena spin-offs into various media including films , books , comics and video games .
In August 1997 Hercules and Xena : The Battle For Mount Olympus a DTV animated movie was released , featuring the voices of a number of actors from both Hercules : The Legendary Journeys and Xena : Warrior Princess .
The television series , which employed pop culture references as a frequent humorous device , has itself become a frequent pop culture reference in video games , comics and television shows , and has been frequently parodied and spoofed .
The issue is left deliberately ambiguous by the show 's writers .

The German Navy -LRB- Kriegsmarine -RRB- played a major role in the Second World War as control over the commerce routes in the Atlantic was crucial for Germany , Britain and later the Soviet Union .
German tank and air force specialists could exercise in the Soviet Union and German chemical weapons research and manufacture would be carried out there along with other projects .
With the entry of the United States in December 1941 , the Wehrmacht found itself engaged in ground campaigns against two major industrial powers .
The German Air Force , led by Hermann GÃ ring , contributed many units of ground forces to the war in Russia as well as the Normandy front .
The motorized formations received much attention in the world press in the opening years of the war , and were cited as the reason for the success of the German invasions of Poland -LRB- September 1939 -RRB- , Norway -LRB- April 1940 -RRB- , Denmark , Belgium , France and Netherlands -LRB- May 1940 -RRB- , Yugoslavia -LRB- April 1941 -RRB- and the early campaigns in the Soviet Union -LRB- June 1941 -RRB- .
Today the term Wehrmacht refers to Germany 's armed forces during the Nazi Germany era and World War II , both in German and English .
At this critical juncture , Hitler assumed personal control of the Wehrmacht high command , and his personal failings as a military commander arguably contributed to major defeats in the spring of 1943 , at Stalingrad and Tunis in North Africa .
Large surface vessels were few in number due to construction limitations by international treaties prior to 1935 .
In 1940 , the FallschirmjÃ ger paratroops conquered the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael and took part in the airborne invasion of Norway , but after suffering heavy losses in the Battle of Crete , large scale airdrops were discontinued .

Where there is no oxygen , some bacteria will make nitrate into nitrogen gas -LRB- N2 -RRB- . This starts the nitrogen cycle over again .
In plants , nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth .
The nitrogen cycle is the way that nitrogen in nature is changed into many different forms that are used by living organisms .
Nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air -LRB- N2 -RRB- into forms that can be used by life .
Nitrogen is needed for life .
In plants , nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth . Nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air -LRB- N2 -RRB- into forms that can be used by life .
Most nitrogen fixation is done by micro-organisms called bacteria . These bacteria have an enzyme that combines N2 with hydrogen gas -LRB- H2 -RRB- to make ammonia -LRB- NH3 -RRB- .
Air is about 78 % nitrogen .

In syntactic analysis , a constituent is a word or a group of words that functions as a single unit within a hierarchical structure .
Phrases -LRB- noun phrases , verbal phrases , etc. -RRB- are usually constituents of a clause , but clauses may also be embedded into a bigger structure .
For example , in the phrase `` I did n't hear what you said , '' the subordinate clause `` what you said '' is embedded into the main clause and is syntactically its object ; this can be demonstrated by substituting the pronoun `` it '' for the subordinate clause `` I did n't hear it . ''

Geoffroy 's theory was not a theory of common descent , but a working-out of existing potential in a given type .
Ã tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire -LRB- 15 April 1772 â `` 19 June 1844 -RRB- was a French naturalist who established the principle of `` unity of composition '' .
He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and believed in the underlying unity of organismal design , and the possibility of the change of species in time . He collected evidence for his claims in comparative anatomy , paleontology , and embryology .
For him , the environment causes a direct induction of organic change .
It is definitely not what Lamarck believed -LRB- for Lamarck , a change in habits is what changes the animal -RRB- .
This opinion Ernst Mayr labels as ` Geoffroyism ' .
Geoffroy was a deist , which is to say that he believed in a God , but also in a law-like universe , with no supernatural interference in the details of existence .
The direct effect of environment is not believed today by any main-stream evolutionist ; even Sir William Lawrence knew by 1816 that climate does not directly cause the differences between human races .
This kind of opinion was common in the Enlightenment , and goes with a rejection of revelation and miracles , and does not interpret the Bible as the literal word of God .
The British Rail Class 124 was a class of initially six-car Diesel Multiple Units used and built specifically for the trans-pennine route .

When the Earth , Sun , and Venus are most favorably aligned , Shapiro showed that the expected time delay , due to the presence of the Sun , of a radar signal traveling from the Earth to Venus and back , would be about 200 microseconds , well within the limitations of 1960s era technology .
Radar signals passing near a massive object take slightly longer to travel to a target and longer to return than it would if the mass of the object were not present .
The time delay effect was first noticed in 1964 , by Irwin I. Shapiro .
The first tests , performed in 1966 and 1967 using the MIT Haystack radar antenna , were successful , matching the predicted amount of time delay .
Shapiro proposed an observational test of his prediction : bounce radar beams off the surface of Venus and Mercury , and measure the round trip travel time .

It was a habit of many Roman generals to choose from the ranks a private force of soldiers to act as guards of their person .
Throughout the 3rd century , the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns .
One of the cohorts held the daily guard at the imperial palace .
The term Praetorian derived from the tent of the commanding general or praetor of a Roman army in the field -- the praetorium .
Through the cunning of their ambitious prefect , Sejanus , the Guard was brought from their Italian barracks into Rome itself .
The title was first used for the guards of generals in the Roman Republic .
Thus , from the ranks of the legions throughout the provinces , Augustus recruited the Praetorian Guard .
The Guard was dissolved by Emperor Constantine I in the fourth century AD .
As Caesar discovered with the 10th Legion Equestris , a powerful mounted unit was desirable in the field .
Under Domitian and Trajan , the guard took part in wars from Dacia to Mesopotamia , while with Marcus Aurelius , years were spent on the Danube frontier .
In time , this cohort came to be known as the cohors praetoria , and various notable figures possessed one , including Julius Caesar , Mark Antony and Augustus -LRB- Octavian -RRB- .
Henceforth the entire Guard was at the disposal of the emperors , but the rulers were now equally at the mercy of the Praetorians .
Seldom used in the early reigns , they were quite active by 69 .
In 23 , Sejanus convinced Tiberius to have the Praetorian fort built just outside Rome .
Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius , their potential political power had been made clear .
The reality of this was seen in 31 when Tiberius was forced to rely upon his own cohors praetoria against partisans of Sejanus .
This elite group of Roman citizens consisted of both infantry and cavalry .
When Augustus became the first ruler of the Roman Empire in 27 BC , he decided such a formation was useful not only on the battlefield but in politics also .
The Praetorian Guard was a force of bodyguards used by Roman Emperors .
While campaigning , the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman Army .

There have been continuous developments since May 2005 .
Whilst there was not much change to the existing weather symbols new symbols giving information Pollen and Sun levels were introduced .
The symbols were designed to be ` self-explicit ' , allowing the viewer to understand the map without a key or legend .
Criticism has been ongoing however , with some viewers complaining about the color scheme , and of a lack of detail beyond 36 hours .
Cloud cover is indicated by the brightness of the map , while rain and snow are indicated by animated blue and white areas respectively .
These were phased out in 1985 for computer graphics , although the basic design of symbols was kept the same .
The broadcast meteorologists are employed by the Met Office .
The first BBC weather forecast was a shipping forecast read on the radio for the Met Office on 14 November 1922 . The first daily weather forecast was broadcast 26 March 1923 .
To do this , the maps were drawn by hand in the London Weather Centre and were taken across London .
In 1936 , the BBC experimented with the world 's first weather maps on television .
On 2 October 2000 BBC Weather underwent a more significant change .
16 May 2005 saw the end of the weather symbols on television after 29 years and 9 months on air . They were replaced by a controversial format as the forecast underwent another redesign , with the flat map replaced by a 3D globe , and weather conditions shown by colored areas .
The map filled the whole TV screen , and an off-screen narrator would comment on the next day 's weather .
It also has world weather , UK outlook and weather news .
During a weather forecast some hours before the storm , Michael Fish started his forecast with the now famous line `` Earlier on today , apparently , a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way .
The website also runs frequent special features about seasonal sports , White Christmas , nature and meteorological science .
The new look won a prestigious Silver Award at the Promax\/BDA Awards in 2006 .

Poor angling of the map , in order to show the curvature of the Earth , led to Scotland appearing little larger than Devon , and Shetland being almost invisible while exaggerating London and the South East .
Well , if you 're watching , do n't worry , there is n't '' .
On 11 January 1954 , George Cowling was the first weather forecaster to stand in front of a weather map .
The forecasts were presented by the same person who had made them , and were not always right .
A new more detailed map of Britain was used based on satellite data .
As a result , the map was realigned , and the moving tour of the UK was lengthened .
Satellite photography was available from 1964 , but was of a poor quality and was given on paper , with the coastline etched in felt-tip pen .
Early hand-drawn maps gave way to magnetic symbols , which in turn gave way to bluescreen -LRB- CSO -RRB- computer-generated imagery technology , each of which allowed the presenter greater control over the information displayed .
This did not change until 1973 when a new computer was bought . This made forecasts twice as accurate as earlier ones .
These forecasts were widely-acclaimed for their simplicity , winning an award from the Royal Television Society .
The move polarised opinion ; some saw it as more accurate and modern , while others disliked the brown color chosen for the landmass and the presumed high cost of the graphics .
This led to many Scottish commentators claiming the BBC was guilty of a London bias .
Early magnetic symbols tended to adhere poorly to the maps , and occasional spelling errors -LRB- such as the presenter writing ` GOF ' instead of ` FOG ' -RRB- marred some broadcasts , but allowed the presenter to show how weather would change over time .
As computational capability improved , so did graphics technology .
Although he was actually referring to a Florida hurricane -LRB- Floyd -RRB- , and went on to forecast stormy conditions over the South of England , the statement has gone down in popular culture as one of the worst mistakes made so publicly .
The BBC Weather website provides outlook weather forecasts for UK and international locations using animated symbols and a format similar in design to that used for the televised broadcasts .
In 1962 , a fax machine and an electronic computer were bought by the Met Office . This gave better and quicker forecasting .
The graphics are provided by Weatherscape XT , which was developed by the commercial arm of the New Zealand Metservice .

Diastole is the time during a heart beat when the heart fills with blood after a contraction . The contraction of the heart is called systole and is the opposite of diastole .
The term diastole comes from the Greek word Î Î Î Ï Ï Î Î '' Î .
During ventricular diastole , the pressure in the -LRB- left and right -RRB- ventricles drops .
Because the heart relaxes during diastole , `` diastolic pressure '' is the lowest pressure within the arterial blood stream during each heart beat .
When blood pressure is measured for medical purposes , diastolic pressure is the second number in the `` ratio '' of systolic to diastolic pressure ; for example : 120\/80 .
There are two types of diastole .
The highest arterial pressure happens when the heart muscle contracts , and is called systolic pressure .
When the pressure in the left ventricle becomes lower than the pressure in the left atrium , the mitral valve opens . The blood then flows from the atrium into the ventricle .

Auguste Rodin -LRB- born FranÃ ois-Auguste-Ren Ã Rodin ; 12 November 1840 â `` 17 November 1917 -RRB- was a French sculptor .
Gradually there came increasing favor from the government and the artistic community .
Rodin 's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory . He modelled the human body with realism , with individual character and physicality .
By 1900 , he was a world-renowned artist .
Rodin refused to change his style .
Rather than try to convince skeptics of its merit , Rodin repaid the SociÃ tÃ his commission and moved the figure to his own garden .
After this experience , Rodin did not complete another public commission .
They clashed with the sculpture tradition , in which works were decorative , formulaic , or highly thematic .
His sculpture suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917 , but within a few decades his legacy solidified .
Although Rodin is generally considered the start of modern sculpture , he did not set out to rebel against the past .
Rodin had a unique ability to model a complex , turbulent , deeply pocketed surface in clay .
Only in 1939 was Monument to Balzac cast in bronze .
Wealthy private clients sought Rodin 's work after his 1900 World 's Fair exhibit . He kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists .

By leaving the first product 's name and maybe its baggage as a forgotten product , the spiritual sequel can be loved by fresh eyes .
A good example of this strategy is Electronic Arts . They have closed many studios while keeping their copyrights and trademarks , such as Bullfrog Productions , Origin Systems , and Westwood Studios .
Other times , a spiritual successor is made when the first products were either poor commercial sellers and\/or forgotten by the people that would purchase the product .
This often makes attempts to make sequels for a product not possible for many reasons . One of the reasons it the `` core '' of the studio being fired or taken over after finishing a project while the parent company keeps control of the copyrights and trademarks .
A Spiritual successor , sometimes called a Spiritual sequel or a Companion piece , is a sequel to a work of fiction which does not have the same storyline made in the first . Spiritual successors still have the same elements , themes , and styles as the first .
An example of this would be BioShock , which has been named to by its makers as the spiritual successor to System Shock 2 .
To get around this , creative teams will make a product that is kind of like the first game in some way , without copying the first directly .
For example , the video games TimeSplitters and , Perfect Dark are often thought to be the spiritual successors to the hit video game GoldenEye 007 .
System Shock and System Shock 2 both got good reviews , but both failed to get the expected commercial success . Unlike BioShock , which was both a reviewer and commercial success .

The Quickstep developed in the 1920s from a combination of the Foxtrot , the Charleston , and other dances .
The dance is English in origin , and was standardized in 1927 .
Unlike the modern Foxtrot , the feet often close and syncopated -LRB- split-beat -RRB- steps occur often .
While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with `` quick '' -LRB- one beat -RRB- and `` slow '' -LRB- two beats -RRB- steps , many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats , such as `` quick-and-quick-and-quick , quick , slow '' , with there being further steps on the ` and 's .
Three characteristic dance figures of the Quickstep are the chassÃ s , where the feet come together , the quarter turns , and the lock step .
The Quickstep is an International Style ballroom dance that follows a 4\/4 time beat , at about 50 bars per minute .
The tempo of Quickstep dance is rather brisk as it was developed to ragtime era jazz music which was fast-paced compared to other dance music .
p62 From its early beginning as a faster Foxtrot , the Quickstep has become quite different .

Although MCA owned the studio lot , but not Universal Pictures , it was increasingly influential on Universal 's product .
After a period of complete shutdown , a moribund Universal agreed to sell its -LRB- by now -RRB- 360-acre -LRB- 1.5 kmÂ -RRB- studio lot to MCA in 1958 , for $ 11 million .
The theater chain was scrapped , but Carl , Jr. held fast to distribution , studio and production operations .
Among them were Mark Dintinfass , Charles Baumann and Adam Kessel , and Pat Powers .
That company quickly evolved into the Independent Moving Picture Company , or IMP .
Distribution and other corporate , administrative offices are based in New York City .
Weekly series production was the workhorse of the company .
It was replaced by United International Pictures in 1981 , when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer joined the fold .
When Standard called the loan in , a cash-strapped Universal could not pay .
The studio lot was upgraded and modernized , while MCA clients like Doris Day , Lana Turner , and Cary Grant were signed to Universal Pictures contracts .
Taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the depression was risky , and for a time Universal slipped into receivership .
In 1910 , he actively promoted Florence Lawrence , then known as the `` Biograph girl '' , in what may be the first instance of a studio using a film star in its marketing .
It was the first time in Universal 's 26-year history that it had borrowed money for a production .
Following the westward trend of the industry , in 1915 , Laemmle opened the world 's largest motion picture production facility , Universal City Studios , on a 230-acre -LRB- 0.9 kmÂ -RRB- converted farm just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood .
It also owns several films made by others , including some pre-1952 United Artists material , an Alfred Hitchcock feature originally released by Warner Bros. - Rope , and the UK rights to most of the RKO Pictures library .
Production problems resulted in a $ 300,000 overrun .
Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary .
However , Carl , Jr. 's spending habits alarmed company stockholders , especially after the costly flop of Sutter 's Gold earlier in the year .
With the advent of sound , these productions were made in the German language or , occasionally , Hungarian or Polish .
This unit produced 3 â `` 4 films per year until 1936 , migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler 's increasing domination of central Europe .
The name was later changed to Universal Pictures Company , Inc.
In 1926 , Universal also opened a production unit in Germany , Deutsche Universal-Film AG , under the direction of Joe Pasternak .
Universal Studios -LRB- sometimes called Universal Pictures or Universal City Studios -RRB- , a subsidiary of NBC Universal , is one of the major American film studios that has production studios and offices located at 100 Universal City Plaza Drive in Universal City , California , an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County between Los Angeles and Burbank .
Though Universal 's film unit did produce occasional hits , among them Airport , The Sting , American Graffiti , and a blockbuster that restored the company 's fortunes , Jaws , Universal in the 1970s was primarily a television studio .
There would be other film hits like E. T : The Extra-Terrestrial , Back to the Future , and Jurassic Park , but overall the film business was still hit-and-miss .
In the early 1970s , Universal teamed up with Paramount Pictures to form Cinema International Corporation , which distributed films by Paramount and Universal worldwide .
The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish remake of Show Boat , featuring several stars from the Broadway stage version , which began production in late 1935 .
Universal is the second longest-lived studio in Hollywood -LRB- Viacom 's Paramount Pictures , Universal 's ownership partner of United International Pictures -- which distributes films by Paramount and Universal worldwide -- is the oldest -RRB- .
The combination of the studio\/theater-chain break-up and the rise of television saw the mass audience drift away , probably forever .
They would not allow production to start on Show Boat unless the Laemmles obtained a loan .
In the USA , Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary 's films , but at least some of them were exhibited through other , independent , foreign-language film distributors based in New York , without benefit of English subtitles .
By the late 1950s , the motion picture business was in trouble .
The Music Corporation of America -LRB- better known as MCA -RRB- , mainly a talent agency , had also become a powerful television producer , renting space at Republic Studios for its Revue Studios subsidiary .
Universal , like any other major movie studio , owns a huge library .
On June 8 , 1912 ; Laemmle merged IMP with eight smaller companies to form the Universal Film Manufacturing Company , introducing the word `` universal '' into the organization 's name .
In June 1909 , Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with partners Abe and Julius Stern .
Universal was forced to seek a $ 750,000 production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation , pledging the Laemmle family 's controlling interest in Universal as collateral .

Version 5 , designed by John Kohl and Clifford Neuman , appeared as RFC 1510 in 1993 -LRB- made obsolete by RFC 4120 in 2005 -RRB- , with the intention of overcoming the limitations and security problems of Version 4 .
Kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attacks .
Steve Miller and Clifford Neuman , the primary designers of Kerberos version 4 -LRB- which used the DES encryption algorithm with 56-bit keys -RRB- , published that version in 1989 , although they had targeted it primarily for Project Athena .
For communication between two entities , the KDC generates a session key which they can use to secure their communications .
Kerberos builds on symmetric-key cryptography and requires a key distribution center . Extensions to Kerberos can provide for the use of public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication .
MIT developed Kerberos to protect network services provided by Project Athena .
It is also a suite of free software published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology -LRB- MIT -RRB- that implements this protocol .
The MIT makes an implementation of Kerberos Version 5 freely available , under a software license similar to that used by BSD license .
Several versions of the protocol exist ; versions 1 â `` 3 used only internally at MIT .
Kerberos database : The key distribution center -LRB- KDC -RRB- maintains a database of secret keys ; each entity on the network â '' whether a client or a server â '' shares a secret key known only to itself and to the KDC .
Kerberos -LRB- pronounced \/ Ë kÉ rbÉ rÉ s \/ `` kur-ber-uhs '' -RRB- is a computer network authentication protocol , which allows people communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner .
It makes use of a trusted third party authentication known as `` key distribution center -LRB- KDC -RRB- '' , which consists of two logically separate parts : an Authentication Server -LRB- AS -RRB- and a Ticket Granting Server -LRB- TGS -RRB- .
Its designers aimed primarily at a client-server model , and it provides mutual authentication â '' both the user and the server verify each other 's identity .
Kerberos uses as its basis the Needham-Schroeder protocol .
These tickets can be used to prove authentication to SS .
Knowledge of this key serves to prove the identity of each entity .
Briefly , the client authenticates to AS using a long-term shared secret and receives a ticket from the AS .
Later the client can use this ticket to get additional tickets for SS using the same shared secret .
The protocol was named after the Greek mythological character Kerberos -LRB- or Cerberus -RRB- , known in Greek mythology as being the monstrous three-headed guard dog of Hades .
The Seal of the State of Maine was adopted in June 1820 .
Above the shield is the motto `` Dirigo '' -LRB- I lead -RRB- , and a North Star .

There have been different kinds in the details of the seal , but the overall design and images remain true to the first .
Below the shield is a banner that reads `` Maine '' .
The legislature of 1919 thought that the design of the seal should no longer vary , and the design is still used today .
The center of the seal is a shield with a tranquil scene of a moose resting in a field bordered by water and woods , pine tree stand tall directly behind the moose .

The closest relatives of the African Penguins are the Humboldt and Magellanic penguins found in southern South America and the GalÃ pagos Penguin found in the Pacific Ocean near the equator .
Boulders Beach is a tourist attraction , for the beach , swimming and the penguins .
Mainland colonies probably only became possible in recent times due to the reduction of predator numbers , although the Betty 's Bay colony has been attacked by leopards .

Generally , the admins should NOT be contacted directly , unless they request your input .
There are many thousands of other WP project pages to consider , as well .
For example , consider the following options :
Note that the publication dates vary , and the news is not updated every week , but rather every several days , with no definite schedule .
Meanwhile , the Wikimedia Commons area contains many maps for all nations or territories , in the form of the `` Wikiatlas '' pages , covered with numerous maps , such as in :
In the event of overlooked typos , it might be safer to visit another page for editing , and return after an hour when other users are done editing the page -LRB- they might also fix those typos -RRB- .
Each Atlas page can vary slightly , but each contains multiple maps , such as a general map , blank-outline map , terrain map -LRB- elevation map -RRB- , a precipitation map , a cities map , population map , earth-quake fault lines , and others .
The Wikipedia articles , talk-pages and project pages are displayed as typical browser screen windows .
When a user tries to save an edit that a prior editor has meanwhile updated , the entire page is rejected , during `` edit conflict '' .
In the past , Wikipedia has avoided the use of detailed maps or road maps , in favor of limited , blank maps which had mostly shaded areas to indicate general borders -LRB- edges of regions -RRB- , counties or provinces .
There are many official Wikipedia policies and guidelines , so do n't be surprised if long-term users are not familiar with all of them .
The navbox below links to the various policies and guidelines .
This essay , WP : Alert , lists many ways to get alerts , news , and answers about Wikipedia issues .
The count of users is the registered users -LRB- not IP addresses -RRB- .
The formatting of most mathematical formulas uses special TeX markup in the HTML tags : -LRB- see HELP : Math -RRB- .
However , once a page is saved , other editors might update it every 3 minutes , because many will change a word and save , change a word & save , even though they know it 's sloppy : the fear of losing multiple changes makes some people SAVE after every tiny change .
Instead , if only 1 SAVE is made -LRB- by pre-combining all changes -RRB- , then other editors will only be alerted to check that page when your entire edit is done .
Since 18 September 2010 , the new-article rate on Simple Wikipedia is currently : per day , computed hourly -LRB- current hour : -RRB- , with the rate typically 15 % lower during the Spring months , but higher in August .
For more , see : HELP : Math .
The Simple Wikipedia help pages -LRB- at -RRB- , which cover many wiki aspects , also link to the MediaWiki help pages -LRB- under META : HELP -RRB- about the underlying software and database servers that store the Wikipedia data .
A few surveys have been conducted over the past 6 years , for the English Wikipedia and the German Wikipedia , to determine reader opinions about WP content and performance .
To avoid losing data , before a SAVE , the edit-buffer should be copied -LRB- Ctrl-A\/Ctrl-C -RRB- into another window , or edit-previewed to save the back-window , and then parts of that text could be restored during a later re-edit .
For detailed discussions of the size of Wikipedia , see the English Wikipedia essay pages : : en : WP : Size of Wikipedia , or : en : WP : Modelling Wikipedia 's growth , or : en : WP : Modelling Wikipedia extended growth .
New guidelines are sometimes created by expanding Wikipedia essays into broader , and more formalized wording .
The problems of uneven quality are critical to understand : there have been large gaps in Wikipedia 's collaboration procedures , and in various fields of study , some major topics went years without being covered in an article .
Wikipedia has the help desk to answer most questions , beginning at or .
Avoiding the troublemakers tends to be a good method to reduce abuse .
In the past , large templates could only be used a few hundred times per page , such as when a template had the help-text documentation or several HTML comments .
Also , although some Wikipedia policies are very thorough , as written , many active users make decisions while still unaware of the actual policy details , and some imagine that Wikipedia `` invents all rules '' regardless of the real world .
Users can request control of editing by saving a tag-template , when finishing an edit , to alert future readers : : \* â `` up to 3 hours .
Search below -LRB- using the browser menu `` Find '' option -RRB- for various details : about Wikipedia system news , about help pages , about surveys or polls , about wiki-technology & servers , about wiki-software updates , about Wikipedia size and users , about Contacting admins , or about MediaWiki markup language .
Many articles about mathematics are monitored for very precise formatting standards .
Some people try to treat guidelines as being far inferior , to policies , but most guidelines have been developed by careful editors who are trying to provide solid advice , to simplify the writing of articles , while working with other users .
On the contrary , Wikipedia does , indeed , follow many mainstream ideas , and articles must be verifiable against the real-world sources .
Those people should learn to request control by , even if only for 1 hour .
The if-test functions include :
Although the Wikipedia project has existed since 2001 , many aspects have remained at a neophyte , or novice , level .
While there are over 800,000 articles about sports , there might be only limited articles on other subjects .
Also , editing just 1 section , at an '' -LRB- edit -RRB- '' tab , can reduce some types of edit-conflict .
Some of the subjects which have lagged the most are : legal terms , financial topics , and African studies .
If multiple editors argue too much about some articles , the official ruling might not be a clear-cut decision of right\/wrong , but instead , all of those editors might be banned from changing those articles for 6 months -LRB- or longer -RRB- .
However , now any documentation text can be skipped by using '' '' at the sections to bypass .
For more about the MediaWiki markup language , such as catching invalid calculations -LRB- with -RRB- or using other if-statements , see : .
However , realize the tag is only a request .
Some aspects of Wikipedia might seem shocking due to those long-term neophyte issues .
For example , per , a `` consensus '' is basically a unanimous decision -LRB- of users acting in good faith -RRB- , but many people treat it as a majority rule -LRB- as `` consens-Us-versus-Them '' -RRB- .
However , they can be customized , for each user , such as setting the page-skin layout , by selecting `` my preferences '' at the top of any page .
Almost any question imaginable has already been answered by someone , at sometime , in Wikipedia 's thousands of project-space pages -LRB- named as in `` Wikipedia : xxxx '' -RRB- .
However , the neophyte aspects and uneven quality help to answer why Wikipedia has many hollow areas , either overlooked or purposely hindered by some users dodging policy controls -LRB- see or -RRB- .
As of March 2010 , local variables are still NOT allowed : is invalid -LRB- Error : Unrecognised word `` x '' -RRB- , although local variables would be trivial to implement for a college student .
In January 2008 -LRB- over years ago -RRB- , the MediaWiki software was upgraded with a major change to the parser -LRB- which reads Wikipedia files -RRB- for faster formatting : the new software allows almost unlimited page-size , and huge templates , by using a recursive descent parser .
A user 's private copy of an article can be delete-flagged , by that user , inserting the line '' '' at the top of a page .
There are many more options , depending on each user , which might be more beneficial for displaying some types of pages or images .
For calculations , use the raw-data form '' : R '' -LRB- such as -RRB- .
However , there is also a Template : Math -LRB- using different coding -RRB- to typeset formulas within a line of text , such as : , coded by using template `` math '' as : : : .
The main manual is the `` Manual of Style '' , with another document describing typical article-format , under '' '' .
Starting a fight usually hurts the good people the most , because their time is wasted as much as those who actively invent trouble .
There are many methods to avoid edit-conflicts .
About wiki surveys :
The queue lines for reporting abuse are explained in the following page of Wikipedia policy topics , focused around the active list in the Administrators ' _ noticeboard .
New page deletions , requested by edit-tagging each page , are handled in several page-category queues linked by inserting , at the top of a new-article page , the template line '' '' .
Pages can access some of those size statistics by using specific variable-names -LRB- see : -RRB- : for example , the total articles is and total-users is in the variable : .
Wikipedia pages are written in the MediaWiki markup language , which supports some HTML coding , and which also allows special coding for wikitables , infoboxes , navboxes , and templates -LRB- see : HELP : Template -RRB- .
Topics include the computers used as wiki-servers plus the MediaWiki software that stores pages , processes templates , formats wikitables and displays the wiki-images .

The introduced birds in New Zealand , where the cuckoo does not occur , have , over the past 130 years , retained the ability to recognize and reject non-mimetic eggs .
The nestlings are mainly fed on animal food such as worms , slugs , snails and insect larvae .
The Song Thrush is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos , but this is very rare because the thrush usually recognizes the cuckoo 's non-mimetic eggs .
It is also known in English dialects as throstle or mavis .
The Song Thrush builds a neat mud-lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four or five dark-spotted blue eggs .
The Song Thrush breeds in forests , gardens and parks , and is partially migratory with many birds wintering in southern Europe , North Africa and the Middle East ; it has also been introduced into New Zealand and Australia .
The Song Thrush -LRB- Turdus philomelos -RRB- is a member of the passerine songbird family Turdidae . It breeds across much of Eurasia .
The thrush often uses a favorite stone as an `` anvil '' on which to smash the snail before extracting the soft body and invariably wiping it on the ground before consumption .
The female Song Thrush builds a neat cup-shaped nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush , tree or creeper , or , in the case of the Hebridean subspecies , on the ground .
She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple .
The Song Thrush has brown upperparts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts , and has three recognized subspecies .
The Song Thrush is omnivorous , eating a wide range of invertebrates , especially earthworms and snails , as well as soft fruit and berries .
Like its relative , the Blackbird , the Song Thrush finds animal prey by sight , has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground , and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items .
However , the Song Thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult Cuckoo that is shown by the Blackbird .
Young birds initially flick objects and attempt to play with them until they learn to use anvils as tools to smash snails .
Snails are especially important when drought or hard weather makes it difficult to find other food .
Its distinctive song , which has repeated musical phrases , has frequently been referred to in poetry .
Like other perching birds -LRB- passerines -RRB- , it is affected by external and internal parasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey .
It is omnivorous and has the habit of using a favorite stone as an `` anvil '' on which to smash snails .
Two or three broods in a year is normal , although only one may be raised in the north of the range .
Although it is not threatened globally , there have been serious population declines in parts of Europe , probably due to changes in farming practices .
Ponomariov remained FIDE champion until Rustam Kasimdzhanov won the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 .
In the same year he finished second in the very strong Linares tournament , behind Garry Kasparov .
However , he is not the youngest undisputed world champion because the traditional World Chess Championship was still held by Vladimir Kramnik .
His result in the strong 2003 Corus tournament at Wijk aan Zee was not as good â `` despite having the third highest rating , he finished only joint eleventh out of fourteen players with 6\/13 , and at Linares the same year he finished only fifth out of seven with 5 Â 1\/2 \/ 12 .
There were plans for him to play a fourteen-game match against Kasparov in Yalta in September 2003 , the winner of which would go on to play the winner of a match between Kramnik and PÃ ter LÃ kÃ as part of the so-called `` Prague Agreement '' to reunify the World Chess Championship -LRB- from 1993 until 2006 there were two world chess championships -RRB- .
However , this was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract without reservation .
In 2002 he beat his fellow countryman Vassily Ivanchuk in the final of the FIDE World Championship 2002 by a score of 4 Â 1\/2 â `` 2 Â 1\/2 . This made him FIDE world champion at the age of 18 , the first teenager and youngest person to win this form of the title .

The first pure alphabet emerged around 2000 BCE to represent the language of Semitic workers in Egypt , and was derived from the alphabetic principles of the Egyptian hieroglyphs .
The first purely alphabetic script is thought to have been developed around 2000 BCE for Semitic workers in central Egypt .
The history of the alphabet begins in Ancient Egypt , more than a millennium into the history of writing .
Over the next 500 years it spread north , and all subsequent alphabets around the world have either descended from it , or been inspired by one of its descendants , with the possible exception of the Meroitic alphabet , a 3rd century BCE adaptation of hieroglyphs in Nubia to the south of Egypt .
By 2700 BCE the ancient Egyptians had developed a set of some 22 hieroglyphs to represent the consonants of their language , plus a 23rd that seems to have represented word-initial or word-final vowels .
Most alphabets in the world today either descend directly from this development , for example the Greek and Latin alphabets , or were inspired by its design .

Cells that lack F plasmids are called F-negative or F-minus -LRB- F - -RRB- and can function as recipient cells .
For example , the tumor-inducing -LRB- Ti -RRB- plasmid of Agrobacterium and the root-tumor inducing -LRB- Ri -RRB- plasmid of A. rhizogenes contain genes that are capable of transferring to plant cells .
Such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbionts .
Agrobacterium-like conjugation is also primarily used for dicots , but monocot recipients are not uncommon .
The F-plasmid is an episome -LRB- a plasmid that can integrate itself into the bacterial chromosome -RRB- with a length of about 100,000 base pairs .
These genes turn plant cells into factories producing chemicals used by the bacteria for nitrogen and energy .
Infected cells form crown galls or root tumors , respectively .
During conjugation the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon .
There can only be one copy of the F-plasmid in a given bacterium , either free or integrated , and bacteria that possess a copy are called F-positive or F-plus -LRB- denoted F + -RRB- .
Conjugation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer , as are transformation and transduction , though these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact .
Conjugation has advantages over other forms of genetic transfer .
In plant engineering , Agrobacterium-like conjugation complements other standard vehicles such as tobacco mosaic virus -LRB- TMV -RRB- .
The basic conjugative plasmid is the F-plasmid , or F-factor .
The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria , which are in turn endosymbionts -LRB- or parasites -RRB- of the infected plant .
In laboratories successful transfers have been reported from bacteria to yeast , plants , mammalian cells , and isolated mammalian mitochondria .
While TMV is capable of infecting many plant families these are primarily herbaceous dicots .
Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the recipient cell does not already contain a similar element .
Conjugation is a convenient means for transferring genetic material to a variety of targets .
Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells .
Benefits may include antibiotic resistance , xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites .
Other elements , however , may be viewed as bacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread .
Bacterial conjugation is often incorrectly regarded as the equivalent of sexual reproduction , since it involves the exchange of genetic material .
The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient .

He should have said `` Stop . ''
After the fall of Saipan , the Japanese commanders knew that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines next . The Philippines were very important because they were located between the oil fields of Southeast Asia and Japan .
The Special Attack force was organized into 4 groups , Unit Shikishima , Unit Yamato , Unit Asahi , and Unit Yamazakura .
Some important military men who survived the war criticized the kamikaze plan years after . Saburo Sakai , a war time ace pilot said : A kamikaze is a surprise attack , according to our ancient war tactic .

He began his coaching career at Vanderbilt University , where he coached special teams , tight ends and H-backs for the Commodores from 1995 -- 96 .
In February 2006 , the Oakland Raiders were interviewing him to become their new head coach , but Whisenhunt ended the talks before a deal could be offered .

A simple dance called â round danceâ is used for nearby flowers . It means `` there is a feeding place near the beehive at 50 to 100 meters '' .
They use this capability to get information on the progress of the day deep inside a dark beehive .
His theory was disputed by other scientists and greeted with skepticism at the time .
This makes it possible for the bees to convey up-to-date directional information during their waggle dance , without having to make a comparison with the sun during long dance phases .
Only recently was it definitively proved to be an accurate theoretical analysis .
Polarization pattern : Light scattered in a blue sky forms a pattern of partially polarized ultraviolet light . This depends on the position of the sun , and is invisible to human eyes .
Variations in the daytime position of the sun : Karl von Frisch proved that variations in the position of the sun gave bees with a tool for navigation .
This provides not only directional but also information on the time of day .
Sense of smell : Frisch discovered that bees can distinguish various blossoming plants by their scent , and that each bee is â flower constantâ .45 â `` 51
Internal clock : Bees have an internal clock with three different synchronization or timekeeping mechanisms .
Karl Ritter von Frisch -LRB- 20 November 1886 â `` 12 June 1982 -RRB- was an Austrian ethologist who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973 , jointly with Niko Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz .
Each lens unit of a compound eye has a UV receptor , and a UV filter oriented differently in each of these units , so a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern .
A small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring over the course of a day .
If a bee knows the direction to a feeding place found during a morning excursion , it can also find the same location , as well as the precise time at which this source provides food , in the afternoon , based on the position of the sun .137 â `` 147

Then , after defecting from the Soviet Union in 1976 , Korchnoi won two Candidates cycles to qualify for World Championship matches with Karpov in 1978 and 1981 .
Korchnoi won game 21 , but Karpov won game 27 , putting him on the brink of victory with a 5 â `` 2 lead .
This is the first world title Korchnoi has won .
This defaulted the match to Korchnoi .
Karpov was declared world champion in 1975 when Bobby Fischer failed to defend his title .
After the release , he was again refused permission to leave the USSR .
His son was promised that he would be allowed to join his father , if he gave up his passport .
After 17 games , Karpov had an imposing 4 â `` 1 lead .
In spite of protests , Korchnoi 's son was arrested for evading army service , sentenced to two and a half years in labor camp , and served the full sentence .
Korchnoi seemed to have great fondness for Garry Kasparov â `` possibly because he recognized the situation Kasparov was in â `` a prominent talent blocked by the Soviet bureaucracy .
When he did so , he was promptly drafted into the Soviet army .
After a good start , Korchnoi was overcome by Kasparov 's attacking play and remarkable maturity .
Korchnoi 's wife and son were still in the Soviet Union .
Korchnoi played three matches against Anatoly Karpov , the latter two for the World Chess Championship .
There was constant controversy off the board , with X-raying of chairs , protests about the flags used on the board , hypnotism complaints and the mirror glasses used by Korchnoi .
Korchnoi first played for Switzerland at the 1978 Olympiad , held in Buenos Aires , where he took the individual gold medal for best performance on board one .
In 1982 , six years after Korchnoi 's defection , his son finally succeeded in leaving the country .
This is the first world title Korchnoi has won . Viktor achieved another mark by winning the 2009 Swiss championship in GrÃ chen .
Korchnoi won the next Candidates ' cycle to again earn the right to challenge Karpov in 1981 .
However , after a remarkable series of events , spearheaded by the British Grandmaster Raymond Keene , Korchnoi agreed to play the match in London .
They later said this was intended as a parody of earlier protests , but it was taken seriously at the time .
The second-oldest player on the January 2007 list was Alexander Beliavsky , 22 years younger than Korchnoi .
He scored 7\/9 at the open tournament .
In what was dubbed the ` Massacre in Merano ' , Karpov defeated Korchnoi convincingly by 6 wins to 2 , with ten draws .
Korchnoi fought back , scoring three wins and one draw in the next four games , to equalise the match at 5 â `` 5 after 31 games .
In September 2006 Korchnoi won the 16th World Senior Chess Championship , held in Italy , with a 9 â `` 2 score .
Korchnoi scored 7.5 â `` 0.5 in his first eight games , then drew his last three games .
Korchnoi was also a four-time USSR chess champion , a five-time member of Soviet teams that won the European championship , and a six-time member of Soviet teams that won the Chess Olympiad .
Korchnoihad a vital part to play in the next -LRB- 1984 -RRB- Candidates ' cycle , where he was due to play the young Soviet Garry Kasparov .
When Karpov 's team sent him a blueberry yogurt during a game without any request for one by Karpov , the Korchnoi team protested , claiming it could be some kind of code .
This was a gracious gesture by Korchnoi , since technically he had already won by default .
The match was to be held in Pasadena , California , but the Soviet Chess Federation protested -LRB- possibly because Korchnoi was a defector and the match was in the cold-war enemy 's back yard , and because of the soon-to-be-announced Soviet decision to boycott the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles -RRB- , and Kasparov was not allowed to fly there to play the match .
Viktor continues to play in Europe to this day , living in his adopted country of Switzerland and frequently representing their Olympiad team on top board .
In all , Korchnoi was a candidate for the World Championship on ten occasions -LRB- 1962 , 1968 , 1971 , 1974 , 1977 , 1980 , 1983 , 1985 , 1988 and 1991 -RRB- .
However , Karpov won the next game , and the match , by 6 â `` 5 with 21 draws .
On the January 2007 FIDE rating list , Korchnoi was ranked number 85 in the world at age 75 , by far the oldest player ever to be ranked in the FIDE top 100 .
The match would go to the first player to win six games , draws not counting .

The lands of the canton are shaped by the river , which in its mid portion forms a wide valley , commonly known as the Riviera .
These lakes are known with the above listed names , but are officially named Lake Verbano and Lake Ceresio .
It drains most of the canton , flowing from the northwest through the Bedretto Valley and the Leventina valley to enter Lake Maggiore near Locarno .
To the north lie the cantons of Valais and Uri , to the northeast the canton of GraubÃ 1\/4 nden .
The western lands of the canton , however , are drained by the Maggia River .
The northern , more mountainous part , called Sopraceneri , is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around the lake Maggiore : Ticino Valley and Maggia Valley .
Three daily newspapers are published in Ticino : Corriere del Ticino , La Regione , and Giornale del Popolo .
Its main tributaries are the Brenno in the Blenio Valley and the Moesa in the Mesolcina Valley in GraubÃ 1\/4 nden .

A cloud of luminescence is expelled , confusing or repelling a potential predator while the squid or crustacean escapes to safety .
In these animals , light organs control the contrast of this illumination to create optiminal matching .
The structure of photophores , the light producing organs in bioluminescent organisms , are being investigated by industrial designers .
Dinoflagellates have an interesting twist on this mechanism .
Every species of firefly has larvae that glow to repel predators .
The cookiecutter shark uses bioluminescence for camouflage , but a small patch on its underbelly remains dark and appears as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it .
Bioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research .
A dangling lure on the head of the fish attracts small animals to within striking distance .
When these fish try to consume the `` small fish '' , they are bitten by the shark , which gouges out small circular `` cookie cutter '' shaped chunks of flesh from its hosts .
Some fish , however , use a non-bioluminescent lure .
Usually , marine light-emission belongs in the blue and green light spectrum , the wavelengths that can transmit through seawater most easily .
In the marine environment this has only been well-documented in certain small ostracod crustaceans , but may be quite common .
Bioluminescence is used as a lure to attract prey by several deep sea fish such as the anglerfish .
In some squid species bacterial bioluminescence is used for counterillumination so the animal matches the overhead environmental light seen from below .
Certain squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescence as many squid use ink .
When a predator of plankton is sensed through motion in the water , the dinoflagellate luminesces .
Usually these light organs are separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria .
This is seen in fireflies , which use periodic flashing in their abdomens to attract mates in the mating season .
Luciferase systems are widely used in the field of genetic engineering .
This in turn attracts even larger predators which will consume the would-be predator of the dinoflagellate .
Most deep-sea marine life use bioluminescence in one form or another .

So we know for the outcome of the products that A = B. Take any prime p from the first product A. It divides the A , so it also divides B. Using several times the lemma that we just proved , we can see that p must then divide at least one factor b of B. But the factors are all primes themselves , so also b is prime .
Further , it can not be a prime number , because a prime number is a ` product ' of a single prime : itself .
Further , it can not be a prime number , because a prime number is a ` product ' of a single prime : itself . So it must be a product of numbers .
The Fundamental theorem of arithmethic -LRB- also called the unique factorization theorem -RRB- is a theorem of number theory . The theorem says that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers -LRB- or the integer is itself a prime number -RRB- .
The Fundamental theorem of arithmethic -LRB- also called the unique factorization theorem -RRB- is a theorem of number theory .
The theorem says that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers -LRB- or the integer is itself a prime number -RRB- .
One of these numbers must be the smallest : let 's call it n. Of course , this number n can not be 1 .
This was first mentioned by Ernst Kummer in 1843 , in his work on Fermat 's last theorem .
However , the theorem is not true in more general number systems , like algebraic integers .
where both a and b are positive integers that are of course smaller than n. But : n was the smallest number that can not be written as a product of primes . So it must be possible to write a and b as products of primes , because they are both smaller than n. But then the product
To do this , we use the following lemma : if a prime number p divides a product ab , then it divides a or it divides b -LRB- Euclid 's lemma -RRB- .

The Cambrian marked a steep change in the diversity and composition of Earth 's biosphere .
Apart from tentative evidence suggesting that some animals floundered around on land , most of the continents resembled deserts spanning from horizon to horizon .
The Cambrian period marked a profound change in life on Earth . Before the Cambrian , life was on the whole small and simple .
The seas were relatively warm , and polar ice was absent .
There are even suggestions that some Cambrian organisms ventured onto land , producing the trace fossils Protichnites and Climactichnites .
While life prospered in the oceans , the land was barren â `` with nothing more than a microbial ` crud ' gracing the soils .
The incumbent Ediacaran biota suffered a mass extinction at the base of the period , which corresponds to an increase in the abundance and complexity of burrowing behavior .
This diversification of lifeforms was relatively rapid , and is termed the Cambrian explosion .
Complex organisms became gradually more common in the Proterozoic , but it was not until the Cambrian that mineralised â `` hence readily fossilised â `` organisms became common .
This means our understanding of the Cambrian biota surpasses that of many later periods .
Shallow seas flanked the margins of several continents , which had resulted from the breakup of the preceding supercontinent Pannotia .
The Cambrian is unique in its many sites of exceptional preservation , where ` soft ' parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells .

At 10:11 a.m. CDT -LRB- 1511 UTC -RRB- , Robert Ricks , a meteorologist with the New Orleans\/Baton Rouge NWS office , issued the following statement :
At this point , Katrina was a Category 3 hurricane with 115 mph -LRB- 185 km\/h -RRB- winds and about 335 miles -LRB- 540 km -RRB- to the south-southeast of the Mississippi River 's mouth .
As a result , a system of levees was authorized by Congress to handle future storm events .
The strongly-worded statement persuaded people to evacuate , and was highlighted by national news media .
As a result , the level of detail was highlighted as an `` innovative best practice '' in the NWS assessment , which recommended issuing warnings with similar levels of detail in the future .
That night , the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening , strengthening to a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph -LRB- 280 km\/h -RRB- by 10:00 am CDT on August 28 .
On the evening of August 25 , 2005 , Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near the Miami-Dade â `` Broward county line in southern Florida and weakened into a tropical storm as a result .
Previous warnings , such as the one made by the Houston Chronicle in 2001 , told of a disaster that `` would strand 250,000 people or more , and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under 20 feet of water '' following a severe hurricane making landfall on the city .
By the next morning , on August 27 , the NHC gave out a hurricane watch that included the New Orleans metro area , which was upgraded to a hurricane warning by 10:00 p.m. CDT that same evening .
Other publications , such as Popular Mechanics , , Scientific American , and The Times-Picayune predicted doomsday situations in which a sinking city would drown and its residents would be left homeless .
As New Orleans is located on the Mississippi River delta and much of the city is below sea level , a strong hurricane could have a devastating effect on the city .
Partly due to this bulletin , people in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi , those most affected by the storm 's impact , followed evacuation orders more closely , resulting in a reduced fatality number .
In the following months after the storm , Congress appointed a two-party system committee to look into the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations before to its landfall .
At 11:00 p.m. EDT August 26 , approximately 56 hours before Katrina 's landfall near Buras , Louisiana , the National Hurricane Center had predicted that the New Orleans metropolitan area could face a direct hit by the storm .
In 1965 , Hurricane Betsy made landfall just south of New Orleans , causing widespread flooding in the city .
Three days before Katrina 's second and third landfalls , the National Hurricane Center began predicting that the storm would make landfall as a major hurricane .
During an internal assessment by the National Weather Service , the 10:11 bulletin and its impact were examined .
The National Weather Service bulletin for the New Orleans region of 10:11 a.m. , August 28 , 2005 was a vividly worded release issued by the local Weather Forecast Office in Slidell , Louisiana warning of the devastation that the Gulf Coast of the United States could experience as a result of Hurricane Katrina .
The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely , were not responsible for failures in other agencies , and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives .
The report called the bulletin `` a significant moment for the NWS during Katrina , '' as its detailed and specific language did not have any previous precedent -LRB- though the message was based on a template designed by the Tampa Weather Office in 1990 -RRB- .
However , the protection given by this system was limited to hurricanes up to Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale .
The National Hurricane Center 's director , Max Mayfield , mentioned that the Mississippi\/Louisiana area has `` the greatest potential for nightmare scenarios , '' and that this has been known for at least the three decades he has worked at the NHC .

More young birds are known from the fossil record of the more northerly sites than from those further south .
They probably fed mainly on fish , maybe also crustaceans , cephalopods and mollusks , as do the diving seabirds of today .
Like many other Mesozoic birds such as Ichthyornis , Hesperornis had teeth in its beak which were used to hold prey -LRB- most likely fish -RRB- .
Their teeth were helpful in dealing with slippery or hard-shelled prey .
Hesperornis was a large bird , reaching up to 1.5 meters -LRB- 5 feet -RRB- in length .
Hesperornis was preyed upon by large marine carnivores such as mosasaurs .
Hesperornis hunted in the waters of such contemporary shelf seas as the North American Inland Sea , the Turgai Strait and the prehistoric North Sea , which then were subtropical to tropical waters , much warmer than today .
This suggests that at least some species were migratory like today 's penguins , which swim polewards in the summer .
Young Hesperornis grew fairly quickly and continuously to adulthood , as is the case in modern birds .
A Tylosaurus specimen contains the bones of a Hesperornis in its gut area .

Nabta Playa was once a large basin in the Nubian Desert . It is about 500 miles south of modern day Cairo or about 100 kilometers west of Abu Simbel of southern Egypt , 22 Â 32 ' north , 30 Â 42 ' east .
People also lived from fruit , legumes , millets , sorghum and tubers .
By the 5th millennium BC these peoples had fashioned one of the world 's earliest known astronomical device -LRB- roughly contemporary to the Goseck circle in Germany -RRB- , about 1000 years older than but comparable to Stonehenge -LRB- see sketch at right -RRB- .
There were also many large hearths at this time .
Huts are found built in straight rows .
By the 6th millennium BC , there may have been a prehistoric religion or cult . Sacrificed cattle were found buried in stone-roofed chambers lined with clay .

In most cases , these are external gills , visible as tufts on either side of the head , although the amphiumas have internal gills and gill slits .
Many species , such as the Olm , have both lungs and gills as adults .
Most species of salamander have small teeth in both the upper and lower jaws .
Some terrestrial species lack both lungs and gills and perform gas exchange through their skin , a process known as valerian respiration in which the capillary beds are spread throughout the epidermis , and inside the mouth .
In the lungless salamanders , muscles surrounding the hyoid bone contract to create pressure and actually `` shoot '' the hyoid bone out of the mouth along with the tongue .
Hunting is yet another unique aspect of salamanders .
Respiration differs between species of salamanders .
Many of the highly aquatic species , however , have no muscles in the tongue , and do not use it for capturing prey , while most other species have a mobile tongue , but without the adaptations to the hyoid bone .
Some salamanders that are terrestrial have lungs that are used in respiration , although these are simple and sac-like , unlike the more complex organs found in mammals .
Salamanders also secrete poison from glands in their skin , and some additionally have skin glands for secreting courtship pheromones .
The tail will drop off and wriggle around for a little while , and the salamanders will either run away or stay still enough to not be noticed while the predator is distracted .
Permanently subterranean salamanders have reduced eyes , which may even be covered by a layer of skin .
The tip of the tongue is composed of a mucus which creates a sticky end to which the prey is captured .
Species that lack lungs respire through gills .
Unlike frogs , even the larvae of salamanders possess these teeth .
The skin of salamanders secretes mucus . This helps to keep the animal moist when on dry land , and maintains their salt balance while in water , as well as providing a lubricant during swimming .
Salamanders routinely regenerate complex tissues .
Muscles in the pelvic region are used in order to reel the tongue and the hyoid back to its original position .
Even some species with lungs can also respire through the skin in this manner .
Salamanders have no external ear , and only a vestigial middle ear .
The larvae , and the adults of some highly aquatic species , also have a lateral line organ , similar to that of fish , which can detect changes in water pressure .
Within only a few weeks of losing a piece of limb , a salamander perfectly reforms the missing structure .
Salamanders can drop their tail to escape predators .
