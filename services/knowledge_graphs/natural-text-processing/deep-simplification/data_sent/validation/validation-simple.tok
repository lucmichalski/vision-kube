That scale will indicate the answer .
The Navitimer circular rule , referred to by Breitling as a `` navigation computer &apos; &apos; , featured airspeed , rate \ / time of climb \ / descent , flight time , distance , and fuel consumption functions , as well as kilometerâ `` nautical mile and gallonâ `` liter fuel amount conversion functions .
It was around that time , as engineering became a recognized professional activity , that slide rules came into wide use in Europe .
The importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers , a new but very scarce resource in the 1950s , became widely available to technical workers during the 1960s .
The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as digital computing devices were gradually introduced ; but around 1974 the electronic scientific calculator made the slide rule largely obsolete and most suppliers exited the business .
In 2004 , education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on prosthaphaeresis , an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms .
Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left -LRB- for subtraction -RRB- or right -LRB- for addition -RRB- then returning the slide to 0 to read the result .
Pocket rules are typically 5 inches .
Some high-end slide rules have magnifying cursors that make the markings easier to see .
For painted slide rules , and the faint of heart , use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth .
His design and uses for the tool gave the slide rule purpose outside of mathematical inquiry .
For instance , there are two nines on the A scale ; to find the square root of nine , use the first one ; the second one gives the square root of 90 .
Users of slide rules would simply approximate or drop small terms to simplify the calculation .
Here the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer .
The main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a rotating disc , and limited number of scales .
Astronomical work also required fine computations , and in 19th century Germany a steel slide rule about 2 meters long was used at one observatory .
Because , this position on the bottom scale gives , the product of and .
Many computer centers had a framed slide rule hung on a wall with the note `` In case of emergency , break glass . &apos; &apos;
For example , a 10 cm circular would have a maximum precision equal to a 30 cm ordinary slide rule .
For example , to calculate 3 \ * 2 , the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale .
All premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved , and then filled with paint or other resin .
Typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures , and the user estimates the third figure .
Tangents are found by comparing the T scale with C or , for angles greater than 45 degrees , CI .
In addition to the logarithmic scales , some slide rules have other mathematical functions encoded on other auxiliary scales .
A sliding cursor with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not next to each other or , in duplex models , are on the other side of the rule .
Various other conveniences have been developed .
The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient , 2.75 .
At several hundred dollars , even this was considered expensive for most students .
The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale .
This was especially useful for fractional powers .
Aluminum Pickett-brand slide rules were carried on five Apollo space missions , including to the moon , according to advertising on Pickett &apos; s N600 slide rule boxes .
In 1630 , William Oughtred of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule , and in 1632 he combined two Gunter rules , held together with the hands , to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule .
The Ln scale was invented by an 11th grade student , Stephen B. Cohen , in 1958 .
Later , the inventor created a set of `` marks &apos; &apos; on the Ln scale to extend the range beyond the 2.3 limit , but Pickett never incorporated these marks on any of its slide rules .
Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper , not on the slide rule .
The basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the longest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 -LRB- i.e. by Ï -RRB- .
Rather than `` split &apos; &apos; scales , high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales .
While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation , and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions , the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of its mastery .
The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales .
Some slide rules -LRB- `` duplex &apos; &apos; models -RRB- have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip , others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip , still others on one side only -LRB- `` simplex &apos; &apos; rules -RRB- .
Common forms such as can be read directly from x on the S scale to the result on the D scale , when the C-scale index is set at k . For angles below 5.7 degrees , sines , tangents , and radians are approximately equal , and are found on the ST or SRT -LRB- sines , radians , and tangents -RRB- scale , or simply divided by 57.3 degrees \ / radian .
The second method uses a sliding linear L scale available on some models .
Computers also changed the nature of calculation .
William Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 1600s . The slide rule is based on the work on logarithms by John Napier .
The Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions .
Istanbul Technical University was started on 1773 .

In other words , EJB QL queries do not use tables and their components . They use enterprise beans , their persistent state , and their relationships .
The used queries are somewhat different from relational SQL . It uses a so-called `` abstract schema &apos; &apos; of the enterprise beans , not the relational model .
EJB QL is a database query language similar like SQL .
EJB QL or EJB-QL is a portable database query language for Enterprise Java Beans .
The result of an EJB QL query is either a single object , a collection of entity objects of a given type , or a collection of values retrieved from CMP fields .
One has to understand the data model of enterprise beans in order to write effective queries .
It is more complex but less powerful than SQL .
The result of an SQL query is a set of rows with a fixed number of columns .
The language has been inspired by the native Hibernate Query Language HQL .

Built of brick and wood , it had two stories with a three story tower .
After she graduated in 1890 , she went on to study at the University of Chicago and Syracuse University , before returning to Hiram in 1896 .
Funding came from hundreds of contributors and friends , prominently the Kresge Foundation , however no single donor contributed enough to confer a name to the building , and so it remains the Hiram College Library .
An observatory with its telescope , a gift of Lathrop Cooley , was a prominent feature of the building until 1939 .
The Library has grown , added and subtracted parts , nearly been destroyed , and moved from one end of the campus to the other in its 100 + year career .
A comprehensive capital campaign by the college featured the construction of a $ 7.1 million facility as its centerpiece .
It was made possible by a substantial gift from Mr. and Mrs. Harley C. Price , and the Library was renamed the Teachout-Price Memorial Library .
Features of the new building included space for a video studio , a redesigned Archives and Special Collections , a Library Instruction Room , group study rooms , and a multi-functional space , the Pritchard Room .
In 1948 a further addition to the south side of the Library was built , again with funds from the Teachout Foundation .
Prior to 1900 , library facilities at Hiram College consisted of the small libraries of each of the student literary societies : Delphic , Hesperian , and Olive Branch .
By the late 1980s the continued growth of the collection , the demand for more study space , and the need to incorporate new technologies led to the decision to plan for a new building .
The Teachout-Cooley Library of Hiram College was erected in 1900 with money given by Abram Teachout .
While a student at Hiram , she was made the librarian of the Olive Branch Society , and did such an excellent job that she was asked to organized the libraries of the other societies .
The west end of the browsing room was designated the Vachel Lindsay Room , and the east end as the Adelaide Robbins Rhodes Room .
Since then , change has been a nearly continuous process with modifications and improvements to the collections , services , and spaces of the Library becoming a yearly , monthly , and weekly affair .
The card catalog was saved from fire damage and much of the lost book collection was replaced .
In 1923 , a supplemental gift from the Teachout family made possible an addition built to the south of the original building , and joined to it by means of a vestibule .
Shortly thereafter , the Library provided access to its new online catalog , and two years later joined the OhioLINK Consortium , thereby expanding the options of our students , faculty , and staff far beyond the walls of the new building .
This expanded the building westward toward Dean Street and effectively doubled the size of the Library once again .
Finally , a fourth addition was necessary by 1963 .
The Libraryâ s collections then consisted of those books donated by the literary societies and the depository collection .
The Media Center became administratively incorporated into the Library .
Completed in 1995 , the collections , equipment , and some of the furnishings of the Library were relocated in the new building that summer .
She served as the collegeâ s Librarian until 1907 , and introduced the Dewey Decimal System to the Library .
But it hasnâ t always been the same place , or even in the same place , through its history .
A Greek portico entrance was added , and the size of the Library was essentially doubled .
But , like a phoenix , the Library rose again , and a newer , more modern building was erected with a main reading room on the lower floor and a browsing room above .
The Hiram College Library has provided a welcoming , comfortable , and intellectually stimulating environment for many generations of students , faculty , staff , and community members .
These were consolidated by the first Librarian of the college , Emma Ryder .
Pitar and Maluma decide to leave the group , saying : â We should leave in time , leave Re and his new Reich , which , when I &apos; m taking into account Thorn &apos; s previous reign , would be the Third over here .
With regard to these underlying comparisons she says : â On another level we are struck by the permanent verbal mix of the ape-like and the human , a combination which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we , who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense , should finally classify man .

In thinking about his social and natural environment , Pitar decides to lead his family to civilization : `` Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness , to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on &apos; &apos; .
Costello pretends the group of females would be his personal harem , but when Maluma falls in love with Pitar , she breaks off her relationship with the leader .
The group builds windbreaks so that they may descend more often from the trees , which has a higher risk of being attacked by wild animals on the ground .
The author published such a glossary on his own website .
However , the calm is broken by the attack of a saber-toothed cat .

Britpop is a type of alternative rock that started in the United Kingdom .
Britpop came out of the British independent music scene of the 1990s and affected , or changed , by British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s .
This kind of music began as a reaction against some trends , or styles , in the late 1980s and early 1990s , such as grunge from the United States .
The plural lyrics was used only in referring to the words of several songs . That it is used for the words of a single song as its lyrics became increasingly common -LRB- probably because of the association between lyrics and the plural form words -RRB- , and is common in modern usage of today &apos; s society .
Use of the singular form lyric is still grammatically acceptable .
The United States Music Publishers &apos; Association -LRB- MPA -RRB- , which represents sheet music companies , created a campaign against such sites in December 2005 . MPA president Lauren Keiser said that the sites are `` completely illegal &apos; &apos; and that he wanted to see some site operators put in prison .
The word lyric was used for the `` words of a popular song &apos; &apos; about 1876 for the first time .
The Plantagenet kingdom , covering England and a lot of France from 1152 to 1453 , supported wine trade between the regions .
The meaning of `` claret &apos; &apos; has changed over time , and now means a dry , dark red Bordeaux wine .
In the Late Middle Ages , a claret was a spiced wine-based drink produced by pouring wine , usually a red , over a bag containing a mix of spices .
It was similar , and often the same , to hypocras .
The term now more often applies to unspiced red Bordeaux wine .
It used to be more of a rosÃ , which is why its name is based on the French word clairet , meaning pale .
Spices that were specific to medieval clarets include anise , caraway , cardamom , cinnamon and fennel .
As the taste for clairet developed in England `` claret &apos; &apos; was adopted to describe it .
The standard style of Bordeaux wine has not always been deep red .

They once even called Maria their `` stepsister &apos; &apos; . This was because she was so good and never got into trouble , according to Margaretta Eagar .
Her French teacher Pierre Gilliard said Maria was tall and healthy , with rosy cheeks .
The governess and Alexandra wanted her to go to bed as a punishment , but Nicholas said no . . He said , `` I was always afraid -LRB- fearful -RRB- of the wings growing .
However , even the sweet Maria could be mischievous sometimes .
I am glad to see she is only a human child . &apos; &apos;
However , further remains were discovered in 2007 , and DNA proved at last that the entire Imperial family had been murdered in 1918 .
`` Fortunately , I arrived just at that moment , picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar , &apos; &apos; remembered her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia .
Eagar remarked that Maria loved her father deeply . She often tried to run away from the nursery to `` go to Papa &apos; &apos; .
When she lived , Maria was not old enough to be a Red Cross nurse like her sisters . Instead , she was patroness of a hospital and visited wounded soldiers .
When her father was ill with typhoid , Maria covered a small picture of him with kisses every night .
Tatiana Botkina thought Maria &apos; s eyes were `` soft and gentle . &apos; &apos;
She was very interested in the lives of the soldiers , and had several innocent crushes on the young men she met .
When she was a baby , people compared her to one of Botticelli &apos; s angels .
Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia called her `` The Amiable -LRB- Good-hearted -RRB- Baby &apos; &apos; .
She was an older sister of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia . Her sister Anastasia was famous for stories about her escape from the murder of the royal family for almost 90 years .
When she was young , Maria once ran away from her bath and ran naked -LRB- without clothes -RRB- all around the palace . Her Irish nurse , Margaretta Eager , who was talking about politics with a friend , did not even notice .
Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia -LRB- Maria Nikolaevna Romanova ; Russian : Ð &apos; Ð Ð &apos; &apos; Ð Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ð 1 \ / 2 Ñ Ð Ð 1 \ / 2 Ð Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ð Ð 3 \ / 4 Ð &apos; &apos; Ð Ð Ð Ð 1 \ / 2 Ð , â `` July 17 , 1918 -RRB- was the third daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna -LRB- Alix of Hesse -RRB- .
People described Maria as a pretty , flirtatious girl . She was plump , with light brown hair and big blue eyes that her family called `` Marie &apos; s saucers &apos; &apos; .
In the 1990s , it was suggested that the grand duchess whose remains were not in the Romanov grave might be Maria .
Once , when she was young , she stole some biscuits from her mother &apos; s tea table .

where is the magnitude of the physical stimulus , is the psychophysical function capturing sensation -LRB- the subjective size of the stimulus -RRB- , is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation and is a proportionality constant that depends on the type of stimulation and the units used .
Although the idea of a power law had been suggested by 19th century researchers , Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957 .
An interesting feature of the above solutions is that when two or more of the lengths are the same -LRB- e.g. -RRB- , there are multiple wavefunctions corresponding to the same total energy .
In quantum mechanics , the wavefunction gives the most fundamental description of the behavior of a particle ; the measurable properties of the particle -LRB- such as its position , momentum and energy -RRB- may all be derived from the wavefunction .
In classical systems , for example a ball trapped inside a heavy box , the particle can move at any speed within the box and it is no more likely to be found at one position than another .
The model is mainly used as a hypothetical example to illustrate the differences between classical and quantum systems .
Likewise , it can never have zero energy , meaning that the particle can never `` sit still &apos; &apos; .
The size -LRB- or amplitude -RRB- of the wavefunction at a given position is related to the probability of finding a particle there by . Therefore , , or .
For the above case two of the lengths are equal so the system is symmetric with respect to a 90 Â rotation .
This can be explained in terms of the uncertainty principle , which states that the product of the uncertainties in the position and momentum of a particle is limited by
The particle may only occupy certain positive energy levels .
In quantum mechanics , however , the probability density for finding a particle at a given position is derived from the wavefunction as For the particle in a box , the probability density for finding the particle at a given position depends upon its state , and is given by
These quantum well systems are particularly important in optoelectronics , and are used in devices such as the quantum well laser , the quantum well infrared photodetector and the quantum-confined Stark effect modulator .
However , infinitely large forces repel the particle if it touches the walls of the box , preventing it from escaping .
The energy levels increase with , meaning that high energy levels are separated from each other by a greater amount than low energy levels are .
Additionally , it is more likely to be found at certain positions than at others , depending on its energy level .
For example the wavefunction with has the same energy as the wavefunction with .
In quantum mechanics , the particle in a box model -LRB- also known as the infinite potential well or the infinite square well -RRB- describes a particle that can move freely between two impenetrable barriers .
It can be shown that the uncertainty in the position of the particle is proportional to the width of the box .
Thus , for any value of n greater than one , there are regions within the box for which , indicating that spatial nodes exist at which the particle can not be found .
This situation is called degeneracy and for the case where exactly two degenerate wavefunctions have the same energy that energy level is said to be doubly degenerate .
If a particle is trapped in a two-dimensional box , it may freely move in the and - directions , between barriers separated by lengths and respectively .
where is the reduced Planck constant , is the mass of the particle , is the imaginary unit and is time .
This contrasts with classical systems , where the particle can have zero energy by resting motionless at the bottom of the box .
Because of its mathematical simplicity , the particle in a box model is used to find approximate solutions for more complex physical systems in which a particle is trapped in a narrow region of low electric potential between two high potential barriers .
The particle in a box model provides one of the very few problems in quantum mechanics which can be solved analytically , without approximations .
The walls of a one-dimensional box may be visualised as regions of space with an infinitely large potential .
Here , the particle may only move backwards and forwards along a straight line with impenetrable barriers at either end .
The wavefunction can be found by solving the SchrÃ dinger equation for the system
This means that the observable properties of the particle -LRB- such as its energy and position -RRB- are related to the mass of the particle and the width of the well by simple mathematical expressions .
The simplest form of the particle in a box model considers a one-dimensional system .
Thus , the uncertainty in momentum is roughly inversely proportional to the width of the box .
Conversely , the interior of the box has a constant , zero potential .
The potential in this model is given as
In classical physics , the particle can be detected anywhere in the box with equal probability .
where is the length of the box and is the position of the particle within the box .
However , when the well becomes very narrow -LRB- on the scale of a few nanometers -RRB- , quantum effects become important .
, where the two-dimensional wavevector is given by .
See also : the history of quantum mechanics .
It is one of the first quantum mechanics problems taught in undergraduate physics courses , and it is commonly used as an approximation for more complicated quantum systems .
The kinetic energy of a particle is given by , and hence the minimum kinetic energy of the particle in a box is inversely proportional to the mass and the square of the well width , in qualitative agreement with the calculation above .
The lowest possible energy for the particle -LRB- its zero-point energy -RRB- is found in state 1 -LRB- when -RRB- , which is given by
The particle , therefore , always has a positive energy .
The particle may never be detected at certain positions , known as spatial nodes .
Using a similar approach to that of the one-dimensional box , it can be shown that the wavefunctions and energies are given respectively by ,
, where the three-dimensional wavevector is given by .
This means that no forces act upon the particle inside the box and it can move freely in that region .
For the particle in a box , it can be shown that the average position is always , regardless of the state of the particle .
Due to its simplicity , the model allows insight into quantum effects without the need for complicated mathematics .
Degeneracy results from symmetry in the system .

The origins of insect flight remain obscure , since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers .
It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect .

The oldest known insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha , from the 396 million year old Rhynie chert .
People often use poisons called insecticides to kill pest insects . Insecticides do not always work .
This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels , which allowed increased respiratory efficiency .
Thus , the first insects probably appeared earlier , in the Silurian period .
Some good insects eat pest insects , such as lady beetles -LRB- or ladybirds or ladybugs -RRB- eating aphids .
The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor .
Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax , for a total of three pairs .
During this era , some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 t making them far larger than any living insect .
Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth , around 252 million years ago .
When helpful insects are killed , such as those that eat pest insects , the pest insects may come back in larger numbers than before because they are not being eaten by helpful insects anymore .
In 2008 , researchers uncovered what they believe is the world &apos; s oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect , a 300 million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period .

When Faustina died in 141 , Antoninus was greatly bereaved and had a temple built in the Roman Forum in her name , had coins with her portrait struck in her honor , and created a charity called Girls of Faustina , which assisted orphaned girls .

Having filled with success the offices of quaestor and praetor , he was consul in 120 . He was appointed by Hadrian as one of the four proconsuls to administer Italia , then Asia .
There is more to this argument , given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus &apos; passing .
Kornemann &apos; s brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders .
The Emperor Hadrian adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138 , after the death of his first adopted son Lucius Aelius . The condition was that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus , the son of his wife &apos; s brother , and Lucius , son of Aelius Verus , who afterwards became the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus .

The name `` Almaty &apos; &apos; comes from the Kazakh word for `` apple &apos; &apos; -LRB- Ð Ð &apos; &apos; Ð 1 \ / 4 Ð -RRB- . The name is often translated as a city `` rich with apples &apos; &apos; .
Almaty -LRB- Kazakh : Ð Ð &apos; &apos; Ð 1 \ / 4 Ð Ñ Ñ ; formerly known as Alma-Ata -LRB- Ð Ð &apos; &apos; Ð 1 \ / 4 Ð - Ð Ñ Ð -RRB- , also Verniy , -LRB- Ð &apos; Ð Ñ Ð 1 \ / 2 Ñ Ð -RRB- -RRB- is the largest city in Kazakhstan .

The so-called `` water &apos; &apos; absorption feature around 3 Î 1 \ / 4 m , which can be a sign of water content in minerals is also present .
Their spectra contain moderately strong ultraviolet absorption at wavelengths below about 0.4 Î 1 \ / 4 m to 0.5 Î 1 \ / 4 m , while at longer wavelengths they are very featureless but slightly reddish .
C-type asteroids are asteroids made of carbonates .
They are the most common variety taking up around 75 % of known asteroids , and an even higher percentage in the farther part of the belt beyond 2.7 AU , which is dominated by this asteroid type .
This type of asteroid has very similar spectra to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites -LRB- types CI and CM -RRB- , whose chemical make-up is about the same as the Sun and the primitive solar nebula , except that they do not contain hydrogen , helium and other volatiles .
Consequently , whereas a number of S-types can normally be viewed with binoculars at opposition , even the biggest C-types require a small telescope .
The potentially brightest C-type asteroid is 324 Bamberga , but that object &apos; s very high eccentricity means it rarely reaches its maximum magnitude .
Hydrated -LRB- water-containing -RRB- minerals are present .
C-type asteroids are very dark with albedos usually in the 0.03 to 0.10 range .
The amount of C-types may actually be higher than this , because C-types are much darker than most other asteroid types except D-types and others common only at the extreme farther edge of the Main Belt .
The biggest unequivocally C-type asteroid is 10 Hygiea , although the SMASS classification places the biggest asteroid 1 Ceres , here as well , because that scheme lacks a G-type .

Depending on what the graph looks like , there may be more than one minimum spanning tree .
The problem can also be approached in a distributed manner .
Its running time is O -LRB- m Î -LRB- m , n -RRB- -RRB- , where m is the number of edges , n is the number of vertices and Î is the classical functional inverse of the Ackermann function .
He wanted to solve the problem of finding an efficient coverage of Moravia with electricity .
Edsger Wybe Dijkstra rediscovered it in 1959 , and called it Prim &apos; s algorithm . The other algorithm is called Kruskal &apos; s algorithm , and was pulbished by Joseph Kruskal in 1956 .
A minimum spanning tree is a tree .
Czech scientist Otakar BorÅ vka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree , in 1926 .
If each node is considered a computer and no node knows anything except its own connected links , one can still calculate the distributed minimum spanning tree .
If all the edges have different weights -LRB- that is : there are no two edges with the same weight -RRB- , there is exactly one minimal spanning tree .
A number of problems from graph theory are called Minimum spanning tree .
The fastest minimum spanning tree algorithm to date was developed by Bernard Chazelle . The algorithm is based on the soft heap , an approximate priority queue .
In a graph where all the edges have the same weight , every tree is a minimum spanning tree .
The function Î grows extremely slowly , so that for all practical purposes it may be considered a constant no greater than 4 ; thus Chazelle &apos; s algorithm takes very close to linear time .

Emus are farmed for their meat , oil and leather .
He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species . Its scientific name , Dromaius novaehollandiae , is from the Latin words , meaning `` fast-footed New Hollander &apos; &apos; .
On the mainland of Australia emus were once common on the east coast but have become uncommon with increased human population . On the other hand the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid -LRB- dry -RRB- regions .
In Victoria , some Indigenous Australian words for the emu were Barrimal in the Djadja wurrung language , myoure in Gunai , and courn in Jardwadjali .
The Emu , Dromaius novaehollandiae , is a large bird , one of the rare birds that can not fly .

The Axis Powers invaded Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 .
They also called Bosnian Muslims `` Croats of the Islamic faith , &apos; &apos; but they had a stronger ethnic dislike of Serbs .

The Belgrade Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims .
Meanwhile PaveliÄ and several hundred UstaÅ e left their camps in Italy for Zagreb , where PaveliÄ set up his government on 17 April .
On 27 April 1941 , a newly formed unit of the UstaÅ e army killed members of the largely Serbian community of Gudovac , near Bjelovar .

The HSS was banned on 11 June 1941 , in an attempt by the UstaÅ e to take their place as the primary representative of the Croatian peasantry .
UstaÅ e activities in villages across the Dinaric Alps led to the Italians and the Germans expressing disquiet .
Vladko MaÄ ek , the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party -LRB- HSS -RRB- which was the most influential party in Croatia at the time , rejected offers German offers to lead the new government .
The UstaÅ e never recognized the existence of a Serb people on the territories of Croatia or Bosnia - they recognized only `` Croats of the Eastern faith . &apos; &apos;
The most reliable figures place the number of Serbs killed by the UstaÅ a between 330,000 and 390,000 , with 45,000 to 52,000 Serbs murdered in Jasenovac .
Italian troops in the field had competing territorial claims with their UstaÅ e allies and had cooperated from the start with Chetnik units operating in the southern areas that they controlled .

These included :
It is widely alleged that this was done through rat lines operated by members of the organization who were Catholic priests and had previously secured positions at the Vatican .
The first two camps , Krapje and BroÄ ica , were closed in November 1941 .
The nuncio was briefed on the efforts of religious conversions to Roman Catholicism .
The UstaÅ e enacted race laws patterned after those of the Third Reich , which were aimed against Jews and Roma and Serbs , who were collectively declared enemies of the Croatian people .
In early 1941 , Jews and Serbs were ordered to leave certain areas of Zagreb
For the duration of the war , the Vatican kept up full diplomatic relations with the UstaÅ a state -LRB- granting PaveliÄ an audience -RRB- , with its papal nuncio in the capital Zagreb .
They also publicly announced the strategy to achieve their goal :
The UstaÅ e regime had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from Serbian and Jewish property owners during WW II into Swiss banks .
Archbishop Stepinac also said this on 28 March 1941 , in note of Yugoslavia &apos; s early attempts to unite Croatians and Serbs : `` All in all , Croats and Serbs are of two worlds , northpole and southpole , never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God .
The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war :
The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names .
Eventually all who opposed and \ / or threatened the UstaÅ e were outlawed .
The exact number of victims is not known .
The UstaÅ e aimed at an ethnically `` pure &apos; &apos; Croatia , and saw the Serbs that lived in Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina as the their biggest obstacle .
They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies . &apos; &apos;
The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942 .
He accorded himself the title of `` Poglavnik &apos; &apos; , - a Croatian approximation to `` FÃ 1 \ / 4 hrer &apos; &apos; and translating to something like `` Headman &apos; &apos; in English .
It was previously headed by Milan BulajiÄ , who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims .
They circulated figures of 400,000 Serbs -LRB- Alexander Lehr -RRB- ; 350,000 Serbs -LRB- Lothar Rendulic -RRB- ; between 300,000 -LRB- Edmund Glaise von Horstenau -RRB- ; more than `` 3 \ / 4 of a million Serbs &apos; &apos; -LRB- Hermann Neubacher -RRB- in 1943 ; 600-700 , 000 until March 1944 -LRB- Ernst Fick -RRB- ; 700,000 -LRB- Massenbach -RRB- .
The number of murdered Jews is fairly reliable : around 32,000 Jews were killed during World War II on NDH territory .
Mile Budak , then a minister in PaveliÄ &apos; s government , publicly proclaimed the violent racial policy of the state on 22 July 1941 .
By the end of 1942 , the news about events at Jasenovac and elsewhere had also spread among the Croatian population .
Gypsies -LRB- Yugoslav Roma -RRB- numbered around 40,000 fewer after the war .
During the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann , Alexander Arnon -LRB- secretary of the Jewish Community in Zagreb -RRB- testified about the treatment of Jews in Yugoslavia during the war .
Vladko MaÄ ek was sent to Jasenovac concentration camp , but later released to serve a house arrest sentence .
After World War II , the remaining UstaÅ e went underground or fled to countries such as Canada , Australia , Germany and South America , with the assistance of Roman Catholic churches and their grassroots supporters Some of them persisted in their crusade against Yugoslavia .
These six camps were closed by October 1942 .
MaÄ ek issued a statement that day , calling on all Croatians to co-operate with the new authorities .
Writers Vladimir Nazor and Ivan Goran KovaÄ iÄ escaped from UstaÅ e-held territory to join the Partisans , and were followed by others .
Along that line , UstaÅ e ministers Mile Budak , Mirko Puk , and Milovan Å 1 \ / 2 aniÄ will declare in May 1941 that the goal of the new UstaÅ e policy was an ethnically clean Croatia .
The UstaÅ e held the position that Eastern Orthodoxy , as a symbol of Serbian nationalism , was their greatest foe .
De facto control over this territory varied for the majority of the war , as the Partisans grew more successful , while the Germans and Italians increasingly exercised direct control over areas of interest .
Here there is no moral , no principles , no truth , no justice , no honesty . &apos; &apos;
Infighting over the failure to establish a Croatian state also fragmented the surviving UstaÅ e . Ante PaveliÄ formed the Croatian Liberation Movement which drew several of the former state &apos; s leaders .
As German forces withdrew from Yugoslavia in 1945 , the UstaÅ e were defeated and expelled by the Yugoslav Partisans .
In 1943 , the Germans suffered major losses on the Eastern Front and the Italians signed an armistice with the Allies , leaving behind significant armaments that the Partisans used against the occupiers and the UstaÅ e . Fighting continued for a short while after the formal surrender of German Army Group E on 9 May 1945 , and many refugees attempted to escape to Austria .

Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind , mental events , mental functions , mental properties , consciousness and their relationship to the physical body , particularly the brain .
These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of RenÃ Descartes .
The mind-body problem , i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body , is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind , although there are other issues that have to do with the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the real -LRB- solid -RRB- body .
Someone &apos; s desire for a hat , for example , will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants .
The mind-body problem has to do with the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds , or mental processes , and bodily states or processes .
The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states \ / processes , and howâ &apos; &apos; or even ifâ &apos; &apos; minds are affected by and can affect the body .
The question , then , is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties .
A related problem is to explain how someone &apos; s propositional attitudes -LRB- e.g. beliefs and desires -RRB- can cause that individual &apos; s neurons to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner .
Our perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states , ultimately causing us to feel a sensation , which may be pleasant or unpleasant .

American physician and humanitarian John Gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 to be able to cool air .
One day in 1928 , while walking through some woods getting sap for maple syrup , Copeman saw that slush and ice came off of his rubber boots instead of sticking to them .
Some novelty trays make blocks of ice in seasonal , festive , or other shapes .
The first rubber ice cube tray was made by Lloyd Groff Copeman .
The first flexible , stainless steel , all-metal ice cube tray was made by Guy L. Tinkham in 1933 .
Ice cubes are also made commercially and sold in big amounts .
Later , he made and patented several kinds of tray : a metal tray with rubber separators , a metal tray with individual rubber cups , and a tray made of only rubber .
Ice cubes are small , cube-shaped parts of ice . These pieces are sometimes used to cool drinks .
Gorrie is the creator of ice cubes , even though he was not trying to cool drinks .
So , to help treat sickness , he advocated for the draining of swamps and the cooling of sickrooms .
Instead , he used the ice to cool the room &apos; s temperature .
Another design is an aluminum tray with a lever that raises the ice cubes up , moving them off of the tray .
Ice cube trays are made to be filled with water , then put in a freezer until the water freezes to ice , making ice cubes .
A motorized kind of this is in most automatic ice-making freezers .
The tray bent sideways to remove the ice cubes .
These are sometimes called ice tubes .
Ice cubes are made by filling a tray with water and putting it in a freezer .
His refrigerator made ice , which he hung from the ceiling in a basin .
Crushed ice is also used when it needs to be made fast , because the speed of cooling depends on the amount and average radius of the ice particles .
Many freezers also have an icemaker . Icemakers make ice cubes and put them in a bin .
An unusual thing about commercially made ice cubes is that they are very clear , and do not have the clouding found in home made ice cubes .
Ice cubes are used in mixed drinks , when the drink has the words `` on the rocks . &apos; &apos;
These ice cubes are usually cylindrical , and might have holes through the center .
After talking about it with his patent attorney at lunch , he did experiments using rubber cups .
Trays are often flexible , so the ice cubes can be removed easily by flexing the tray .

Display in Julian or Chinese calendar date is possible using parameter 2 .
Other 3 digit years may be misinterpreted as well , so best practice is to use leading zeros to make a 4 digit year for this date range .
It is very unusual for people to mention such dates so long ago , so when we really mean this date , we must specify a 4 digit date .
Most time zone abbreviations as well as a large number of place names are recognized .
Instead , use `` February 0274 &apos; &apos; .
If time zone or location is missing , the local time of the event discussed in the article is assumed .
The user of course may express the display form in the second parameter however they would like .
`` Fuzzy &apos; &apos; dates and times are supported .
Background : There is a good rationale for the behavior of the system function which actually does the hard work of this template .
These changes will not affect display , but for those curious , this is the rationale for such bot manipulations .
These templates are an alternative to the \ / and \ / templates that also emit microformats but require dates to be expressed in a special number oriented syntax .
BCE -LRB- required for BCE dates -RRB- set to yes if the date is BC .
Authors may specify place names -LRB- see list -RRB- or time zones such as EDT , PST , HST and so on and these will be properly adjusted to UTC -LRB- Coordinated Universal Time -RRB- for transfer to other applications via microformat encoding .
timezone -LRB- required if timezone information specified -RRB- Set to yes if the time is UTC or if the location , timezone , or timezone offset is specified .
Gregorian calendar dates are required .
-LRB- See recognized timezone values table . -RRB-
For the years 99 BC to 99AD especially , microformats may not be emitted properly unless expressed in the form YYYY-MM-DD .
If year is absent , the current year is assumed .
See timezone parameter if UTC time is desired .
For users uninterested in microformats , it should be noted that this restriction has no known impacts other than microformat data which are currently invisible to users .
parameter 1 -LRB- required -RRB- The date and time to display and to emit as a microformat date .
ISO8601 -LRB- optional -RRB- if present , this ISO8601 date \ / time value is emitted instead of the value derived from parameter 1 .
Time zones are assumed to be local to the event .
For events where the precise time , day or month is not known , the user may omit these details .
For example , February 274 will be interpreted as February 27 , 2004 .
Start-date -LRB- birth-date -RRB- and end-date -LRB- death-date -RRB- are easy to read `` plain text &apos; &apos; date and time templates that emit microformat dates for events .
Bot runs may make a conversion of non 4 digit years to 4 digits -LRB- with leading zeros -RRB- in order to refine Wikipedia &apos; s quality of microformat dates .
Example : 1-2-3 is interpreted as February 3 , 1 A. D , and emitted in that form via microformats when the user may have intended something else .
Outside of this period with ambiguous years , users may use free text dates without this restriction .
If hour , or minutes are missing , zero is assumed .
-LRB- short form tz -RRB-
If day is missing , the first of the month is assumed .
If time zone information is specified , the otherwise optional timezone parameter must be set .

Charles Darwin wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of On the Origin of Species : `` Passing over ... Buffon , with whose writings I am not familiar . &apos; &apos;
Buffon held the position of Intendant -LRB- Director -RRB- of the Jardin du Roi , now called the Jardin des Plantes ; it is the French equivalent of Kew Gardens .
On this basis , he is sometimes considered a `` transformist &apos; &apos; and a precursor of Darwin .
He was the founder of biogeography .
But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods , and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species , I need not here enter on details . &apos; &apos;
He was the first person to discuss a large number of evolutionary problems , problems that before Buffon had not been raised by anybody ... he brought them to the attention of the scientific world .
He also suggested that the earth originated much earlier than the 4004 BC of Archbishop James Ussher .
In the opening volumes of the Histoire naturelle Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics , criticized Carl Linnaeus &apos; s taxonomical approach to natural history , outlined a history of the Earth with little relation to the Biblical account , and proposed a theory of reproduction which ran counter to existing ideas .
Buffon noted that despite similar environments , different regions of the world have distinct plants and animals . This observation , later known as Buffon &apos; s Law , may be the first principle of biogeography .
And yet , he hindered evolution by his frequent endorsement of the immutability of species .
Then , from the fourth edition onwards , he amended this to say that `` the first author who in modern times has treated it -LRB- evolution -RRB- in a scientific spirit was Buffon .
In Les Ã poques de la nature -LRB- 1778 -RRB- Buffon discussed the origins of the solar system , speculating that the planets had been created by a comet &apos; s collision with the sun .
Georges-Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon -LRB- 7 September 1707 â `` 16 April 1788 -RRB- , usually called Buffon , was a French naturalist . He was also a mathematician , cosmologist and encyclopedic author .
Basing his figures on the cooling rate of iron tested at his Laboratory le Petit Fontenet at Montbard , he calculated that the age of the earth was 75,000 years .
He developed a concept of the `` unity of type , &apos; &apos; a precursor of comparative anatomy .
In volume 14 he argued that all the world &apos; s quadrupeds had developed from an original set of just thirty-eight quadrupeds .
He brought the idea of evolution into the realm of science .
He was not an evolutionist , yet he was the father of evolutionism .
More than anyone else , he was responsible for the acceptance of a long-time scale for the history of the earth .
`` Truly , Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century &apos; &apos; .
1379 was a common year starting on Saturday -LRB- link will display the full calendar -RRB- of the Julian calendar .

When Arnold died in 1473 , Duke Charles added Guelders to his Burgundian Netherlands .
The duchy was named after the town of Geldern -LRB- Gelder -RRB- in what is now called Germany .
The Treaty of Utrecht ended the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 . The Spanish Upper Quarter was again divided between Prussian Guelders -LRB- Geldern , Viersen , Horst , Venray -RRB- , the United Provinces -LRB- Venlo , Montfort , Echt -RRB- , Austria -LRB- Roermond , NiederkrÃ 1 \ / 4 chten , Weert -RRB- , and the Duchy of JÃ 1 \ / 4 lich -LRB- Erkelenz -RRB- .
When Reginald died without a heir in 1371 , William I of JÃ 1 \ / 4 lich inherited Guelders .
Its territory did not only grow because of its success in warfare , it also did very well in times of peace .
However he was not able to repay the debts , so these lands became integral parts of Guelders .
In 1423 Guelders passed to the House of Egmond .
Guelders or Gueldres -LRB- Dutch : Gelre , German : Geldern -RRB- is the name of a historical county . This became a duchy -LRB- lands ruled by a duke or duchess -RRB- of the Holy Roman Empire , located in the Low Countries .
Duke Adolf was fighting with his father Arnold about the inheritance of the land . Arnold came under pressure from the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold , who put him in prison in 1471 .
The coat of arms of the region changed during the ages .
It was then located on the territory of Lower Lorraine , in the area of Geldern and Roermond . Its main stronghold was at Montfort -LRB- built 1260 -RRB- .
The county was first mentioned in about 1096 , when Gerard III of Wassenberg was first documented as `` Count of Guelders &apos; &apos; .
In the 12th and 13th century , Guelders became larger very quickly downstream along the sides of the Maas , Rhine , and IJssel rivers . It even claimed the lands in the Duchy of Limburg .
This article deals with the historical county and duchy of Guelders , for other meanings see Gelderland .
The present province of Gelderland -LRB- English also Guelders -RRB- in the Netherlands occupies most of the area . However , the former duchy also included parts of the present Dutch province of Limburg and the territories in the present-day German state of North Rhine-Westphalia that were acquired by Prussia in 1713 .
In 1339 Count Reginald II of Guelders became a duke as ordered by Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV of Wittelsbach .
Guelders was often at war with its neighbors . Not only with Brabant , but also with the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht .
He left the duchy to Duke William the Rich of JÃ 1 \ / 4 lich-Cleves-Berg in his will . However , he was not able to hold on to it and Emperor Charles V of Habsburg soon moved in .
Count Gerard &apos; s son Gerard II in 1127 got the County of Zutphen in northern Hamaland by marriage .
The northern Netherlands stood up against King Philip II of Spain in the Dutch Revolt . The three northern quarters of Gelderland joined the Union of Utrecht and became part of the United Provinces when the 1581 Act of Abjuration was agreed .
William II , count of both Holland and Zeeland , gave Nijmegen in use to Guelders in return of a loan .
The last independent Duke of Guelders was Adolf &apos; s son Charles of Egmond -LRB- 1492-1538 -RRB- .
Charles V stood down in 1556 . He decided that the territories of the Burgundian Circle should be part of the monarchy of Spain .
Guelders finally lost its independence , when it was united with the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands in 1543 .

Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth Macroglossum stellatarum which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like Petunia , Zinnia , Dianthus and others .
Gladiolus -LRB- from Latin , the diminutive of gladius , a sword -RRB- is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family -LRB- Iridaceae -RRB- .
About 10 species are native to Eurasia .
These flowers are variously colored , pink to reddish or light purple with white , contrasting markings , or white to cream or orange to red .
The outer three tepals are narrower .
There are 160 species of Gladiolus endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa .
The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section .
The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce .
In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color .
The genus Gladiolus contains about 260 species , of which 250 are native to sub-Saharan Africa , mostly South Africa .
The style has three filiform , spoon-shaped branches , each expanding towards the apex .
Their stems are generally unbranched , producing 1 to 9 narrow , sword-shaped , longitudinal grooved leaves , enclosed in a sheath .
The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance , and are termed tepals .
Sometimes called the sword lily , the most widely-used English common name for these plants is simply gladiolus -LRB- plural gladioli , gladioluses or sometimes gladiolas -RRB- .
They grow from rounded , symmetrical corms , that are enveloped in several layers of brownish , fibrous tunics .
Actually , They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps .
The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees , but some changes in the pollination system have occurred , allowing pollination by sunbirds , noctuid and sphingid moths , long-tongued flies and several others .
The ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules , containing many , winged brown , longitudinally dehiscent seeds .
These attractive , perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates .
The dorsal tepal is the largest , arching over the three stamens .
These seeds are unable to germinate .
They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure .
In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps .
The perianth is funnel-shaped , with the stamens attached to its base .
In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat .
The fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided , with secund , bisexual flowers , each subtended by 2 leathery , green bracts .
The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll .
Gladioli are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Large Yellow Underwing .

The Convention People &apos; s Party -LRB- CPP -RRB- was a political party made by Kwame Nkrumah in 1949 .
However , the following year , a detachment of soldiers from Britain -LRB- they had been drafted to Italy to suppress brigands -RRB- denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor . They had been enabled to do so by Cleander , who was seeking to dispose of his rival .
On 31 December Marcia poisoned his food but he vomited up the poison ; so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner , Narcissus , to strangle him in his bath .
Early in 188 , Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect , and himself took over supreme command of the Praetorians at the new rank of a pugione -LRB- `` dagger-bearer &apos; &apos; -RRB- with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him .
In December he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January .
Perennis had all the legionary legates in Britain dismissed .
p106 Later , he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart . and afterwards carried the bleeding head of the dead bird and his sword over to the section where the Senators sat and gesticulated as though they were next .
He also ruled as co-emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius from 177 until his father &apos; s death in 180 .
The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions .
Four of his sisters were considerably older than he ; the eldest , Lucilla , held the rank of Augusta as the widow of her first husband , Lucius Verus .
He also had the head of the Colossus of Nero adjacent to the Colosseum replaced with his own portrait , gave it a club and placed a bronze lion at its feet to make it look like Hercules , and added an inscription boasting of being `` the only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men &apos; &apos; .
In the view of Dio Cassius , a contemporary observer , his accession marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron &apos; &apos; . The historian Edward Gibbon took Commodus &apos; s reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire .
The first crisis of the reign came in 182 , when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother .
At the outset of his reign , Commodus , aged 19 , inherited many of his father &apos; s senior advisers .
Thus , these public fights would not end in a death .
Commodus took the loss of Saoterus badly , and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy .
The emperor also had a passion for gladiatorial combat , which he took so far as to take to the arena himself , dressed as a gladiator .
Citizens of Rome missing their feet through accident or illness were taken to the arena , where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants .
As a result , Commodus appeared even more rarely in public , preferring to live on his estates .
Perennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favorite in Cleander , a Phrygian freedman who had married one of the emperor &apos; s mistresses , Demostratia .
At this point , the prefect Laetus formed a conspiracy with Eclectus to supplant Commodus with Pertinax , taking Marcia into their confidence .
One of the ways he paid for his mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order , and on many inscriptions , the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state , the Senate and People -LRB- Senatus Populusque Romanus -RRB- is provocatively reversed -LRB- Populus Senatusque ... -RRB- .
In Britain in 184 , the governor Ulpius Marcellus pushed the Roman frontier north to the Antonine Wall , but the soldiers revolted against his harsh discipline .
In the spring of 190 , Rome was afflicted by a food shortage , for which the official actually in charge of the grain supply managed to lay the blame on Cleander .
He also had five surviving sisters , all of them with husbands who were potential rivals .
It was rumored that he was actually the son , not of Marcus , but of a gladiator whom his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of Caieta .
In November 192 , Commodus held Plebian Games in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning , and fought as a gladiator every afternoon , naturally winning all the bouts .
In the arena , Commodus always won since his opponents always submitted to the emperor .
In 187 , one of the leaders of the deserters , Maternus , came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March , but he was betrayed and executed .
For each appearance in the arena , he charged the city of Rome a million sesterces , straining the Roman economy .
Unrest around the empire increased , with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in Gaul and Germany .
These acts may have contributed to his assassination .
Commodus &apos; s death marked the end of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty , and the beginning of the end for the Western Roman Empire .
Commodus -LRB- Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus , 31 August 161 â `` 31 December 192 -RRB- was Roman Emperor from 180 to 192 .
The reign of Marcus Aurelius had been marked by almost continuous warfare , even though he preferred books to war . That of Commodus was comparatively peaceful in the military sense but was marked by political strife , and the arbitrary and capricious behavior of the emperor himself .
Pompeianus retired from public life .
Privately , it was his custom to slay his practice opponents .
At the urging of his mistress Marcia , Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed .
According to Dio Cassius , Perennis , though ruthless and ambitious , was not personally corrupt and generally administered the state well .
The Romans found Commodus &apos; naked gladiatorial combats to be scandalous and disgraceful .
Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus .
According to Gibbon , Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day .
Commodus presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire and Roman life and religion .
One of the two Praetorian Prefects , Tarrutenius Paternus , had actually been involved in the conspiracy , but was not detected at this time . In the aftermath , he and his co-Prefect Sextus Tigidius Perennis organised the murder of Saoterus , the hated chamberlain .
His accession as emperor was the first time a son had succeeded his father since Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79 .
Commodus was succeeded by Pertinax , whose reign was short lived , being the first to fall victim to the Year of the Five Emperors .
A revolt in Brittany was put down by two legions brought over from Britain .
Now at the zenith of his power , Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business .
Commodus &apos; statues were thrown down .
They were seized by the emperor &apos; s bodyguard , and executed ; Lucilla was exiled to Capri and later killed .
Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as governor of Britain by Pertinax ; brought to Rome and tried for treason , Marcellus narrowly escaped death .
Her motive is alleged to have been envy of the Empress Crispina .
Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus , Commodus &apos; s cousin Annia Fundania Faustina , and his brother-in-law Mamertinus .
Marcia is alleged to have been a Christian .
Commodus continued to rule through a cabal , which now consisted of Marcia , his new chamberlain Eclectus , and the new praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus , who about this time also had many Christians freed from working in the mines in Sardinia .
On his death , the Senate declared him a public enemy and restored the original names to the city of Rome and its institutions .
On another occasion , Commodus killed three elephants on the floor of the arena by himself .
The climax came in the year 190 , which had 25 suffect consulsâ &apos; &apos; a record in the 1,000-year history of the Roman consulshipâ &apos; &apos; all appointed by Cleander -LRB- they included the future Emperor Septimius Severus -RRB- .
Often , wounded soldiers and amputees would be placed in the arena for Commodus to slay with a sword .
They bungled the job .
Commodus was the first emperor `` born to the purple &apos; &apos; , that is , born during his father &apos; s reign .
During 191 , the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days , during which many public buildings including the Temple of Pax , the Temple of Vesta and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed .
At the end of June , a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the Circus Maximus : he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances , but Pertinax , who was now City Prefect of Rome , dispatched the Vigiles Urbani to oppose them .
Commodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena , often to the horror of the Roman people .
Finally , Commodus killed a giraffe which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast .
On 15 October 184 at the Capitoline Games , a Cynic philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus , who was watching . He was immediately put to death .
Papirius Dionysius was executed too .
Cleander fled to Commodus , who was at Laurentum in the house of the Quinctilii , for protection , but the mob followed him calling for his head .
Her husband , Pompeianus , was not involved , but two men , alleged to have been her lovers , attempted to murder Commodus as he entered the theater .

Sometimes , serfs were soldiers during war . They could get freedom or even ennoblement for bravery in war .
In many cases , serfs had to get permission from their lord to marry someone who was not a serf for that lord .
Before that time , Eastern Europe had less people than Western Europe . The lords of Eastern Europe tried to make people want to move there from Western Europe .
Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the Black Death epidemics .
In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to go away west of the Rhine even as it grew in Eastern Europe .
Serfdom reached Eastern European countries later than Western Europe . It became the main way around the 15th century .
Laws varied from country to country : in England a serf who made his way to a chartered town and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom .
If his Lord sold some land , the serf of that land went with it to serve their new Lord .
Serfdom was the system where great landlords could make sure other people worked to feed them and are forced , legally and economically , to keep doing that .
Parts of Europe , including much of Scandinavia , never used serfdom or other feudal institutions .
In Western Europe , the rise of powerful monarchs , towns , and an improving economy weakened the manorial system through the 13th and 14th centuries . Serfdom was not common after the Renaissance .
A manorial Lord could not sell his serfs like Romans can sell their slaves .
There was still serfdom in Russia until February 19 , 1861 . In Russian Baltic provinces it ended in the beginning of 19th century -LRB- Russian Serfdom Reforms -RRB- .
This was one important cause for the deep differences between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe .
During that time , people said that the a serf `` worked for all &apos; &apos; , a knight or baron `` fought for all &apos; &apos; and a churchman `` prayed for all . &apos; &apos;
A serf had some freedom .
The word `` Serf &apos; &apos; came from the Latin servus , meaning `` slave &apos; &apos; .
At the same time , there were more protests by serfs and peasants , like Tylerâ s Rebellion in England in 1381 . This put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to change the system and make it better .
In other cases , serfs could also purchase their freedom , be manumitted by their enlightened or generous owners , or flee to towns or newly-settled land where few questions were asked .
Russian serfdom was different than in other Eastern European countries , because it wasnâ t changed by German law and people coming from Germany . The serfdom and manorialism systems were forced by the crown -LRB- Tsar -RRB- , not the nobility .
This empire had ruled most of western Europe for more than 200 years . It was followed by a long time when there were no strong central governments in most of Europe .
The serfdom of medieval times began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century .
This system gave most of the agricultural labor during the Middle Ages .
Their heirs usually got an inheritance .
A serf could sometimes buy his freedom .
A serf could get and keep property and money . Some serfs had more money and property than their free neighbors .
In some places , serfdom changed into different types of taxation .
A serf could not leave his lands without permission . A serf could not sell his lands .

Before modern times the government of the Isle of Man was in the hands of the Governor -LRB- or Lieutenant Governor -RRB- , who representated the Lord of Man , assisted by his Council , consisting of the other permanent officials -LRB- the Bishop , Archdeacon , Deemsters , Attorney General , etc . -RRB- .
The Departments and their functions are now as follows :
Finance and the police came under local control between 1958 and 1976 .
Created in 1985-87 , they were the successors of the former Boards of Tynwald .
Statutory boards and offices are listed below the Department to which they report .
Conflict between the House of Keys -LRB- popularly elected after 1866 -RRB- and the Lieutenant Governor came to a head when Lord Raglan was Lieutenant Governor between 1902 and 1918 .
The Council became the Legislative Council , the upper chamber of Tynwald , the parliament of the Isle of Man .
As noted above , a number of ` Statutory Boards &apos; and ` Commercial Boards &apos; were created at various times .
After the Revestment -LRB- when the rights of the Lord of Man were `` placed in &apos; &apos; or `` vested &apos; &apos; in the King of Great Britain -RRB- in 1765 , the Lieutenant Governor and his officials were the agents of the British Government , and not democratically responsible to the Manx people .

The departments all report directly to the Council of Ministers .
However , although direct taxation was levied by Tynwald , the Boards &apos; freedom of action before the 1960s was limited by the Lieutenant Governor &apos; s control of the Island &apos; s budget and his power to appoint certain of their members .
The executive head is the Chief Minister .
The formal head of the Isle of Man Government is the Lieutenant Governor , representing HM Queen Elizabeth II , Lord of Mann .
An Executive Council , chaired by him and including members of Tynwald , was established in 1949 , and gradually thereafter became the effective government of the Island .
This is somewhat more than 10 % of the population of the Island , and a full 23 % of the working population .
Some were taken over by the Departments in 1985-1987 , but others continued as separate Statutory Boards after 1987 :
The Isle of Man Government is the government of the Isle of Man .
Douglas , the largest town on the Isle of Man is its capital and seat of government , where the Government offices and the parliament chambers are located .
The Lieutenant Governor stopped chairing the Executive Council in 1980 , and was replaced by a chairman elected by Tynwald , and the Council was reconstituted in 1985 to include the chairmen of the eight principal Boards ; in 1986 they were given the title ` Minister &apos; and the chairman was styled ` Chief Minister &apos; .
The structure and functions of the Departments were re-organised with effect from 1 April 2010 .
The Civil Service has more than 2000 employees and the total number of public sector employees including the Civil Service , teachers , nurses , police , etc. is about 9000 people .
During the 19th century several bodies , which came to be known as ` Boards of Tynwald &apos; , were created to exercise functions under democratic control .
After World War I the Lieutenant Governor gradually gave up control to Tynwald , a process guided by the reports of commissions and other bodies in 1911 , 1959 and 1969 .
This does not include any military forces , as defense is the responsibility of the United Kingdom .
In 1990 the Council was renamed the ` Council of Ministers &apos; .

This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution , dubbed the ` Cambrian explosion &apos; .
However , complex , image-forming eyes evolved some 50 to 100 times â `` using many of the same proteins and genetic toolkits in their construction .
How this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism &apos; s environment varies widely . Eyes have a wide range of structures and forms , all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules .
Eyes show a wide range of adaptations to meet the requirements of the organisms which bear them .
One biologist holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that led to a rapid spate of evolution .
Eyes may vary in their acuity , the range of wavelengths they can detect , their sensitivity in low light levels , their ability to detect motion or resolve objects , and whether they can discriminate colors .
They can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from .
Complex eyes appear to have first evolved within a few million years , in the rapid burst of evolution known as the Cambrian explosion .
Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups .
Certain components of the eye , such as the visual pigments , appear to have a common ancestry â `` that is , they evolved once , before the animals radiated .
Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes .
Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms .
At a cellular level , there appear to be two main `` designs &apos; &apos; of eyes , one possessed by the protostomes -LRB- molluscs , annelid worms and arthropods -RRB- , the other by the deuterostomes -LRB- chordates and echinoderms -RRB- .
The first fossils of eyes appeared during the lower Cambrian period , about 540 million years ago .
Its red pigment shades a collection of light sensitive crystals .
Eyespots can only distinguish light from dark . This is enough for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms .
It is difficult to estimate the rate of eye evolution .
Simple modelling , supposing small mutations exposed to natural selection , shows that a primitive optical sense organ based upon efficient photopigments could evolve into a complex human-like eye in about 400,000 years .
There is no evidence of eyes before the Cambrian , but a wide range of diversity is evident in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale .
The earliest light sensors were photoreceptor proteins . They are eyespots , found in protists .
The Euglenas eyespot , called a stigma , is at the front .

Until 1996 a similar system existed in Scotland and Wales but this has now been replaced by a fully unitary system .
A unitary system has existed in Northern Ireland since 1973 .
In Germany a kreisfreie Stadt is the equivalent term for a city which is responsible for the local and the Kreis -LRB- district -RRB- administrative level .
Typically unitary authorities cover large towns or cities , which are large enough to be independent of county or regional administration .
A unitary authority is a type of local authority that is responsible for all local government functions within its area .
One should not confuse municipalities in provinces with no upper-level of local government as single-tier municipalities , as these are the only level of local government in that province .
This is opposed to the system of local government which still exists in most of England , where local government functions are divided between county councils and district councils .
Sometimes they consist of counties which have no lower level of administration .
In the United Kingdom , `` Unitary Authorities &apos; &apos; are English councils which are responsible for almost all local government functions within their areas .
Unitary authorities or single-tier municipalities exist as a single level of government in a province that otherwise has two levels of local government .

Partial reform of local government in England since 1995 has led to the creation of so-called ceremonial counties to which lord-lieutenants are now appointed .
Ceremonial counties may be comprised of combinations of county council areas and unitary authorities .
Local Government reform in England in 1965 led to the appointment of lord-lieutenants to Greater London and Huntingdon and Peterborough , and the abolition of those of the County of London , Middlesex and Huntingdonshire .
The Local Government -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1973 replaced the counties with regions , and each region was to have one or more lord-lieutenants appointed .
They are unpaid , but receive minimal allowances for secretarial help , mileage allowance and a driver .
A more fundamental reform of local government throughout England and Wales -LRB- outside Greater London -RRB- created a new structure of metropolitan , non-metropolitan and Welsh counties in 1974 .
The Head of the Commission is the Lord Mayor of London .
The Lieutenancies Act 1997 is the most recent piece of primary legislation dealing with Lieutenancies in England and includes the definitive list of the current areas used .
Both men and women are eligible for the post .
There is no uniform for a female Lord-Lieutenant , but there is a badge which can be worn on ceremonial occasions .
The usual age of retirement is 75 . They are appointed for life , although the sovereign may remove them .
The City of London was unaffected by changes introduced since 1882 .
The official title of the office at this time was His or Her Majesty &apos; s lieutenant for the county , but as almost all office-holders were peers they were referred to as `` lord-lieutenant &apos; &apos; .
In 1996 Scottish regions and districts were abolished on further local government reorganisation , and since that date lord-lieutenants have been appointed to lieutenancy areas .
It was not until the threat of invasion by the forces of Spain in 1585 that lieutenants were appointed to all counties .
The title Lord Lieutenant is given to the British monarch &apos; s personal representatives around the United Kingdom , usually in a county , with varying tasks throughout history .
So the combination of counties and county corporates as lieutenancy counties was restored .
Since the local government re-organisation of 1996 in Wales , lord-lieutenants are now appointed to preserved counties .
He was Commander of these forces and appointed their officers .
Section 218 of the Local Government Act 1972 that established the new system stated : `` Her Majesty shall appoint a lord-lieutenant for each county in England and Wales and for Greater London ... &apos; &apos; The Act appears to be the first statutory use of the term `` lord-lieutenant &apos; &apos; for lieutenants to counties .
The areas to which they were appointed approximated to the counties and were based and were defined in terms of the new local government districts .
Lieutenants were first appointed to a number of English historic counties by Henry VIII in the 1540s , when the military functions of the sheriff were handed over to him .
His creation dates from the Tudors .
After the defeat of the Spanish Armada , the need for lieutenants was reduced â &apos; &apos; and the lieutenancies of some counties were left vacant in the 1590s .
The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was the head of the British administration in Ireland until the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922 .
As the sovereign &apos; s representative in his or her county , the Lord-Lieutenant remains non-political and holds no office in any political party .
In England and Wales and Ireland , the lord lieutenant was the principal officer of his county .
The uniform for a male Vice Lord-Lieutenant and Deputy Lieutenants is of a similar style , but with features to distinguish it from a Lord-Lieutenant .
He raised was responsible for the efficiency of the local militia units of the county , and afterwards of the yeomanry , and volunteers .
The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 established County Territorial Force Associations , of which the lord-lieutenant was to be head .
Usually a retired local notable , senior military officer , peer or business person is given the post honourarily .
In 1975 counties ceased to be used for local government purposes in Scotland .
Male Lord-Lieutenants receive an allowance for the ceremonial uniform , worn when receiving members of the royal family and on other formal occasions .
Male Lord-Lieutenants wear a dark blue uniform in the style of an Army No. 1 dress along with a cap and sword with a steel scabbard .
It has a Commission of Lieutenancy rather than a single Lord-Lieutenant .
Lieutenancies became more organised soon , probably in the reign of his successor Edward VI , their establishment being approved by the English parliament in 1550 .

On his return to Nuremberg in 1495 , DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer opened his own workshop .
In fact , very soon after he got back to Nuremberg , on 7 July 1494 DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was married to Agnes Frey .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer wrote that Giovanni Bellini was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice .
A self-portrait , a drawing in silverpoint , is dated 1484 -LRB- Albertina , Vienna -RRB- .
In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer wanted to meet Martin Schongauer , the best engraver of Northern Europe , but Schongauer died shortly before DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s arrival .
It had 1,809 woodcut pictures by the Wolgemut workshop .
His first painted self-portrait is now in the Louvre . It was painted in Strasbourg , probably so that DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer could send it back to his fiancÃ e in Nuremberg . .
This was the altar-piece known as the Adoration of the Virgin or the Feast of Rose Garlands .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was the third child and second son of his parents , who had between fourteen and eighteen children .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer probably did not cut any of the woodblocks himself .
He also continued to make images in watercolor and bodycolor -LRB- usually combined -RRB- , including a number of very beautiful still lives of meadow sections or animals , including his `` Hare &apos; &apos; -LRB- 1502 , Albertina , Vienna -RRB- .
By this time DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s engravings were very popular and were being copied .
During this period he also completed the two woodcut series , the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin .
Nuremberg was a rich city , a center for publishing and many luxury trades .
He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany , and owned twenty-four printing presses and had many offices in Germany and abroad .
Within three months DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer left for Italy .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s father died in 1502 and his mother died in 1513 .
In early 1506 , he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507 .
His father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith , but he was so good at drawing that he started as an apprentice to Michael Wolgemut at the age of fifteen in 1486 .
Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time , and had a large workshop making different types of works of art , in particular woodcuts for books .
He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year , and a little later , a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints .
Around 1503 â `` 1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the life of the Virgin , which he did not finish for some years .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was admired by the Venetians , but he was back in Nuremberg by mid-1507 . He stayed in Germany until 1520 .
The famous works he made in this period were the thirty-seven woodcuts for the Little Passion , published first in 1511 , and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512 .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56 . He left money and goods worth 6,874 florins - a considerable sum .
The house is now a museum .
In 1513 and 1514 he created his three most famous engravings , The Knight , Death , and the Devil -LRB- or simply , The Knight , as he called it , 1513 -RRB- , Melencolia I , and St. Jerome in his Study -LRB- both 1514 -RRB- .
In Brussels he saw `` the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; the Aztec treasure that HernÃ n CortÃ s had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico .

She was the daughter of a well known brass worker -LRB- and amateur harpist -RRB- in the city .
After completing his term of apprenticeship in 1489 , DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer followed the common German custom of taking a wanderjahre â &apos; &apos; in effect a gap year . DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was away nearly four years , traveling through Germany , Switzerland , and probably , the Netherlands .
Later , the Emperor Rudolf II took it to Prague .
Other paintings DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer made in Venice include , The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch , Christ disputing with the Doctors -LRB- supposedly produced in just five days -RRB- , and a number of smaller works .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer had started to learn goldsmithing and drawing from his father .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer made large numbers of other practice drawings , especially for his paintings and engravings , and many survive , most famously the Praying Hands -LRB- 1508 Albertina , Vienna -RRB- .
Neither these , nor the Great Passion , were published as sets until several years later , but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers .
It had strong links with Italy , especially Venice , a relatively short distance across the Alps .
But he had designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut as part of his training in Wolgemut &apos; s studio , and he had seen many carved and painted altarpieces made in the studio . This means he knew what could be made into a woodblock print , and how to work with the expert block cutters .
The Venetian artist Jacopo de &apos; Barbari , whom DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer had met in Venice , visited Nuremberg in 1500 , and DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective , anatomy , and Body proportions from him .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer may well have worked on some of these , as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s godfather was Anton Koberger , who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was born .
It includes portraits of members of Venice &apos; s German community , but shows a strong Italian influence .

DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself , or glued a paper drawing to the block .
In 1515 , he created his woodcut of the Rhinoceros .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer wrote that this treasure trove `` was much more beautiful to me than miracles .
This is a series of drawings show DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s experiments in human proportion , before he made his famous engraving of Adam and Eve -LRB- 1504 -RRB- .
His famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse are dated 1498 .
His most iconic images are his woodcuts of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse -LRB- 1497 â `` 1498 -RRB- from the Apocalypse series , the Rhinoceros , and numerous self-portraits in oils .

The causes of the Bronze Age collapse - which extended throughout the eastern Mediterranean - remain obscure , although drought , famine and other stresses may be behind the widespread population movements of the time ; in any case , a number of important Canaanite cities were destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age -LRB- although the process was spread out over more than a century -RRB- , and Canaanite culture was gradually absorbed into that of the Philistines , Phoenicians and Israelites .
In order to carry out this project the Hasmonean kings conquered -LRB- and forcibly converted to Judaism -RRB- the one-time Moabites , Edomites and Ammonites , as well as the lost kingdom of Israel .

Judean exiles returned from Babylon early in the following Persian period , starting the period in the starting of a Judahite presence in the province of Yehud , as Judah was now called .
Israel became an important local power in the 9th and 8th centuries BCE before falling to the Assyrians ; the southern kingdom , Judah , enjoyed a period of richness as a dependency of the greater empires of the region before a revolt against Babylon led to it being destoried early in the 6th century .
About a hundred years later , in the 9th century BCE , the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III names Ahab of Israel among his enemies at the battle of Qarqar -LRB- 853 BCE -RRB- , while in the Mesha stele -LRB- c . 830 BCE -RRB- a king of Moab celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the `` House of Omri &apos; &apos; -LRB- i.e. Israel -RRB- . Similarly , the Tel Dan stele tells of the death of a king of Israel , probably Jehoram , at the hands of an Aramaen king about 841 BCE .
`` The Levant thus constitutes a narrow corridor whose geographical setting made it a constant area of contention between more powerful entities &apos; &apos; .
East of the plain and the Shephalah is a mountainous ridge , the `` hill country of Judah &apos; &apos; in the south , the `` hill country of Ephraim &apos; &apos; north of that , then Galilee and the Lebanon mountains .
The kingdom established by the Maccabees was a conscious attempt to revive the Judah described in the bible : a Jewish monarchy ruled from Jerusalem and stretching over all the territories once ruled by David and Solomon .
The eastern Mediterranean seaboard - the Levant - goes 400 miles north to south from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai desert , and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the Arabian desert .
Settlement during the Late Bronze was concentrated in the coastal plain and along major communication routes , with the central hill-country only sparsely inhabited ; each city had its own ruler , constantly at odds with his neighbors and appealing to the Egyptians to adjudicate his differences .
Yehud was absorbed into the subsequent Greek-ruled kingdoms which followed the conquests of Alexander the Great .

Several methods for solving such systems are known .
In cryptography , the XSL attack is a method of cryptanalysis for block ciphers .
Therefore , it does not affect the real-world security of block ciphers in the near future .
However , the attack has caused some experts to insert complexities in the algebraic simplicity of the current AES .
It has caused some argument as it was claimed it may break the Advanced Encryption Standard -LRB- AES -RRB- cipherâ &apos; &apos; also known as Rijndaelâ &apos; &apos; faster than a brute force attack .
In the XSL attack , a specialized algorithm , termed XSL -LRB- eXtended Sparse Linearization -RRB- , is then applied to solve these equations and compute the key .
The XSL attack relies on first analyzing the internal design of a cipher then deriving a system of quadratic simultaneous equations .
In addition , the method requires long effort , which unless shortened , means the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to a brute force attack .
These systems of equations are typically very large , for example 8000 equations with 1600 variables for the 128-bit AES .
The attack was first published in 2002 by researchers Nicolas Courtois and Josef Pieprzyk .
The attack is well-known and famous for requiring only a handful of known plaintexts to perform ; previous methods of cryptanalysis , such as linear and differential cryptanalysis , often require unrealistically large numbers of known or chosen plaintexts , which make them impossible to realize .

If a player &apos; s move places the opponent &apos; s king under attack , that king is in check , and the player in check is made to stop the attack .
Castling is only allowed when the king nor the castling rook has moved already , when no squares between them are occupied , when the king is not in check , and when the king will not move across or end its movement on a square that puts the king in check .
In the endgame , however , the king may comes out of hiding to play an active role as an offensive piece as well as helping in the promotion of their remaining pawns .
The object of the game is to checkmate -LRB- capture the king -RRB- .
In the opening and middlegame , the king will mostly not play an active role in the development of an attacking or defensive position .
Castling consists of moving the king two squares on its first rank toward either one of the first rooks , then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed .
There are three possible ways to remove the king from check :
If the king can not do this , it is in checkmate , and that side loses the game .
With a rook , the king may make a special move called ` castling &apos; .
With a rook , the king may make a special move called ` castling &apos; . This is when the king moves two squares toward one of its rooks and then the rook is placed on the other side of the king .
If none of these three ways are possible , the player &apos; s king has been checkmated and the player with the checkmated king loses the game .
Instead , a player will usually castle and find safety on the edge of the board behind pawns .

Most people prefer `` button &apos; &apos; style Pugs .
Pugs can be a lot of different colors , including fawn , the color of an apricot , silver , or black .
Hip dysplasia is another major problem for pugs . About 63.8 % of pugs were caught with hip dysplasia .
Many pugs won dog shows , and soon the Pug Dog Club was founded in 1931 .
The lower teeth normally grow farther out than the upper teeth , so they meet in an under-bite .
Other films that have pugs include 12 Rounds , , Marie Antoinette -LRB- 2006 film -RRB- , and Disney &apos; s film about Pocahontas .
`` Reverse sneezing &apos; &apos; is usually not harmful to the pug .
They have also appeared on television , in shows like the The West Wing .
They have often been described as multum in parvo , which means `` much in little &apos; &apos; , referring to the pug &apos; s character and size .
In the early 551 BCE , Confucius described the pug as a `` short mouthed dog &apos; &apos; .
William III and Mary II also took a pug with them when they were going from Netherlands to England for the seat of the throne in 1688 .
A Mrs. Piozzi wrote in her journal that `` every carriage I meet here has a pug in it &apos; &apos; .
The pug is a type of dog with a wrinkly face . It also has a curled tail , and pug puppies are called puglets .
The tail usually curls at the hip .
A pug &apos; s normal body temperature is between 101 Â and 102 Â .

`` Rose &apos; &apos; ears are smaller than the `` button &apos; &apos; ears and are folded up instead of on the side of the head .
All dogs usually die within a few months after this disease , which usually happens from 6 months to 7 years of age .
Pugs have come out in television and film , such as Frank the Pug in the film Men in Black and the follow-up series .

The major exception to the convention that the number tracks the order they were or the order that they &apos; re orbit was calculated is the case of Pluto .
By ca 1858 , the circle had been simplified to brackets , &apos; &apos; -LRB- 4 -RRB- &apos; &apos; and &apos; &apos; -LRB- 4 -RRB- Vesta &apos; &apos; , which was easier to typeset .
It looks like this : , for example -LRB- 90377 -RRB- Sedna or .
The brackets are now often removed , as in 90377 Sedna , according to what the astronomer wants .
The rule for moons of minor planets , such as the formal designation -LRB- 87 -RRB- Sylvia I Romulus for the asteroid moon Romulus , is an extension of the Roman numeral convention that had been used , on and off , for the moons of the planets since Galileo &apos; s time .
They are used for dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as asteroids , but not comets .
By 1851 , there were 15 asteroids , all but one with their own symbol .
They are given to a body once its orbit is secured , and are unrelated to provisional designations , which are given when an object is found .
Comets are also managed by the Minor Planet Center , but use a different cataloguing system .
Since Pluto was originally called a planet , it was not given a number until a 2006 redefinition of `` planet &apos; &apos; that did n &apos;t include it .
Minor planet designations are number-name combinations given by the Minor Planet Center , a part of the IAU .
At that point , Pluto was given the formal designation -LRB- 134340 -RRB- Pluto .
In practice , however , for any reasonably well-known object the number is mostly a catalogue entry , and the name or provisional designation is generally used in place of the formal designation : Sedna , .
Other punctuation such as `` 4 -RRB- Vesta &apos; &apos; and `` 4 , Vesta &apos; &apos; was also used , but had more or less completely died out by 1949 .

Momofuku Ando , born GÃ Peh-hok -LRB- å ç 3 \ / 4 ç -RRB- in Taiwanese -LRB- March 5 , 1910 - January 5 , 2007 -RRB- was the founder and chairman of Nissin Food Products Co . , Ltd . , and the inventor of the modern instant noodle , ramen .
As prices dropped , ramen soon became a booming business .
Called Chikin Ramen , after the original flavor , it was originally considered a luxury food item as it cost around six times that of traditional non-instant udon and soba noodles .
Ando was born to Taiwanese parents in Kagi -LRB- currently Chiayi -RRB- , Taiwan and grew up an orphan in Tainan City .
The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum is named after Ando .
In 1964 , looking for a way to promote the instant noodle industry , Ando founded the Instant Food Industry Association which set guidelines for fair competition and product quality , introducing several industry standards such as the inclusion of production dates on packaging .
Ando began sales of the Cup noodles on September 18 , 1971 .
On August 25 , 1958 , at the age of 48 , and after months of trial and error experimentation , Ando announced that he had finally perfected his flash-frying method and therefore invented the instant noodle .
This principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires .
This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally .
Those who advocate these measures are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process .
In some countries , such as Germany , law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction , production , distribution , use and waste of a product , and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way .
This is quite common for instance among homeless people in U.S. cities .
The container deposit charged for a deposit bottle may be a fee to buy the bottle , separately from the fee to buy what it contains .
It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of -LRB- fictional , national , legal -RRB- `` commodity &apos; &apos; and `` product &apos; &apos; relationships .
Also , since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle , it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving .
When purchasing paint or tires in many places , one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become .
If not , one has paid the fee , and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle .
If one returns the bottle , the fee is returned , and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling .

Cold deserts are covered with snow or ice .
There are hot deserts and cold deserts .
Cold deserts can be found close to the poles . That is why they are also called polar deserts .
Animated sequels and movie-length episodes of animated series are also often released in this fashion . -RRB-
If the show has a considerable fanbase , the studio may release unaired episodes on video to recoup losses .
According to Variety , American Pie : Band Camp sold a million copies in one week , despite retaining only two actors from the original trilogy .
Some SpongeBob SquarePants DVD volumes contain episodes not yet aired in the United States .
The budgets for movies distributed by these companies are even smaller than those of ones distributed by a larger studio , but these companies are still able to profit off their sales .
Television spin-offs are animated or live action television series or made for TV movies which contain either characters or theme elements from an older series or movie -LRB- Clerks : The Animated Series , Bill and Ted &apos; s Excellent Adventures -RRB- .
Such movies can cost as much as $ 20 million -LRB- about a third of the average cost of a Hollywood release -RRB- and feature actors like Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal .
However , the word `` video &apos; &apos; does not necessarily refer to VHS cassettes .
Some studio movies released direct-to-video are movies which have been completed but were never released .
Direct-to-video releases can be done for movies which can not be shown theatrically due to controversial content , or because the cost involved in a theatrical release is beyond the releasing company .
The new term used is DVDP -LRB- `` DVD Premiere &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
DVDPs have collectively grossed over $ 3 billion over the last few years , and have matured enough that DVDP divisions of studios now option their own movies .
They are often used to tell stories too short to fill a full TV season , and were particularly common in the early 1990s .
Studios then recoup some of their losses through video sales and rentals .
Several companies , such as The Asylum , MTI Home Video , and York Entertainment distribute DVDPs almost exclusively .
DTV releases are subject to fewer content restrictions and less creative dictate than other formats .
This delay often occurs when a studio doubts a movie &apos; s commercial prospects would justify a full cinema release , or because its `` release window &apos; &apos; has closed .
Often a production studio will develop a TV show or movie which is not generally released for several possible reasons : poor quality , lack of support from a TV network , controversial nature , or a simple lack of general public interest .
The Walt Disney Company began making sequels of most of its animated movies for video release beginning with The Return of Jafar -LRB- the sequel to Aladdin -RRB- in 1994 .
With the advent of the 13 episode season format , OVAs are less common now .
In the case of anime , this is called Original Video Animation -LRB- OVA or OAV -RRB- , and their production values usually fall between those of television series and movies .
Clerks : The Animated Series and Firefly are examples of canceled shows which were successful cult hits on DVD .
In the case of a TV show , low ratings may cause a studio to cancel the show , possibly after having filmed an entire season and aired some episodes .
As the DVD format supplants the videocassette , companies have increasingly released movies in DVD format rather than VHS , causing the term `` direct-to-DVD &apos; &apos; to replace `` direct-to-video &apos; &apos; in some instances .
Sometimes OVAs garner enough interest to justify commissioning a full television series , like Tenchi Muyo !
Some Disney Channel shows , such as That &apos; s So Raven , The Suite Life of Zack and Cody , Phil of the Future , and Lilo &amp; Stitch : The Series have also had direct-to-video episodes .
Originally canceled in 2004 , the series was revived in 2005 due partly to its excellent DVD sales .
A release window refers to a timely trend or personality , and missing that window of opportunity means a movie , possibly rushed into production , failed to release before the trend faded .

Zaragoza was also very powerful and expansive , but inhibit by the neighbor Christian states of the Pyrenees .
The reason that taifas developed was that there was an administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate of CÃ rdoba and also an ethnic division of the elite of this state . It was divided among Arabs -LRB- they werde a powerful but tiny minority -RRB- , Berbers , Eastern European former slaves and Iberian Muslims -LRB- known as MuladÃ es -LRB- those were the great majority -RRB- .
The most dynamic taifa , which conquered most of its neighbors before the Almoravid invasion , was Seville .
After the end of the Caliphate the rival Muslim kingdoms were much weaker than the Christian ones , and had to submit to them and to pay tribute .
Taifas often hired Christian mercenaries to fight neighbouring realms -LRB- both Christian and Muslim -RRB- .
A taifa -LRB- from á Ä ` ifa , plural Ø Ù Ø Ø Ù á awÄ ` if -RRB- was an independent Muslim-ruled principality .

A good example is found here at : Template : SEPTA color :
The style template allows the modification , at a system level , of display parameters for inter-related templates , including : Template : Infobox Station .
The parameter makes it possible to show within the box lines available at a different station with which there &apos; s a direct transfer from the current station .
This also forces the use of hex codes ; no nouns are permitted -LRB- e.g. red , white -RRB- .
You can see that S-line takes only parameters -- no linking necessary !
The Limited &apos; s `` left &apos; &apos; template is still a simple line of text -- Chicago -- but the `` right &apos; &apos; template needs a switch statement .
Note : this template is called by ; an alias .
This template is designed the same way as the others except that a default case is rare -- lines within a system tend to have a different color .
S-line must be encased within and .
Before discussing them , however , let &apos; s review the parameters :
: Template : S-rail is used to generate headings for each grouping of rail services in a box .
In this example below , the branch template -LRB- : Template : MBTA lines \ / branches -RRB- is defined , allowing branch linking .
Optionally , Template : lines \ / branches may be defined , which allows the linking of the branch parameter .
They can also get pretty tricky depending on the setup .
The template receives one parameter , from S-line .
For rail lines that operate in only one direction -LRB- such as going around a loop -RRB- , the oneway1 or oneway2 parameters are used , to indicate that the Previous or Next station , respectively , does not have service going towards it .
Template : S-rail-start is a variant of the generic template used to begin thousands of succession boxes .
Additionally , left and right termini are returned based on the passed parameter :
The template receives two parameters from S-line , and , although use of the latter is not often necessary .
Now , let &apos; s say we &apos; ve got a more complicated example , like the Lake Shore Limited , which runs from Chicago east to either Boston or New York .
You need templates to define the following things : the formatting \ / linking of the line , the formatting \ / linking of the previous and next stations , the display of the line &apos; s color , and the display of the appropriate termini -- all automatic .
Therefore , `` Dowagiac &apos; &apos; produces Dowagiac , all linked and ready to go .
For an example , here are the templates necessary to properly display this box -LRB- a version of which is at Kalamazoo Transportation Center :
The use of is highly recommended but not required .
When these parameters are present with any non-null value , the toward -LRB- Terminal -RRB- line is replaced with One-way Operation .
The rows parameters specify how many lines the station should cover , while the hide parameters ensure that the table formatting remains intact .
The template takes one parameter , .
The Wolverine is an easy example .
Additionally , the branch name is displayed beneath the line name .
This template carries a translation table for the formatting \ / linking of the line .
For S-line to produce the table above five separate templates were defined .
The two parameters must be used together , with hide specified for every line that is being covered by the first line .
Therefore , the `` left &apos; &apos; -LRB- westbound -RRB- template contains `` Chicago &apos; &apos; while the `` right &apos; &apos; -LRB- eastbound -RRB- template contains `` Pontiac &apos; &apos; .
Note that color is spelled the American way in the template ; the creator apologizes in advance and it &apos; s probably not worth the hassle to change it at this stage .
S-line depends on sub-templates for the proper display of information .
A feature of S-line is that if it detects that the next station is the name as the terminus , it will display a note to that effect instead of the destination .
The easiest way to start the station template is with the default case that reflects how articles on system stations are named .
Station will be either the PREVIOUS or NEXT parameter ; both are handled the same way behind the scenes .
Template : S-line \ / left \ / -LRB- : Template : S-line \ / Amtrak left \ / Wolverine -RRB- Template : S-line \ / right \ / -LRB- : Template : S-line \ / Amtrak right \ / Wolverine -RRB- These are the all-important templates which produce the `` towards ... &apos; &apos; part of the templates .
The relevant line from : Template : Amtrak lines is this :
Here &apos; s the Limited &apos; s `` right &apos; &apos; template :
Here we have only one , but some particularly large terminals may have three or four -LRB- see Union Station -LRB- Chicago -RRB- or 30th Street Station -RRB- .
In order to make this work properly , you have to define the concept of `` New York or Boston South &apos; &apos; in the STATION template , like so :
This allows three eastbound destinations : New York , Boston , or both if the train has n &apos;t reached the junction point yet .
The left and right templates receive one parameter , , from s-line , which tells them which termini to return .
These names are plugged in to the STATION template just as NEXT and PREVIOUS were , with the results that you can see above .
S-rail uses the translation table at : Template : S-rail \ / lines ; if the entry is undefined , it simply links the text .
It runs end-to-end from Chicago , Illinois to Pontiac , Michigan .
Therefore , Amtrak produces Amtrak , while LUL gives London Underground .
This means if the article ever moves , you need only to update switch statement , not individual articles .
In the example below , the parameter designates four different parts of the MBTA Green Line .
For example , for a CTA station in the Chicago Loop :
This snippet is taken from City Hall -LRB- SEPTA station -RRB- .
The pound sign is included within s-line so it is n &apos;t necessary .
The parameter can be used to describe a subset of a .
For lines that operate on the same tracks and serve the same next station and final terminal , the rows1 , rows2 , hide1 , and hide2 optional parameters can be used to have the Previous -LRB- the 1s -RRB- or Next -LRB- the 2s -RRB- Station boxes cover more then one line .
A default statement is acceptable here if it is true for disproportionate length of the line .
With systems that have unusual or non-uniform naming , like Amtrak , it may be necessary to have a test case for every line .
An example of this use can be seen in the above CTA box .
Amtrak is an important exception , and does n &apos;t even have a switch statement : the template consists only of the hex code : 004670 .
When passed to the left and right termini templates , the and parameters identify destinations .
This links to the article on the Wolverine and italicizes the article , appropriate for a named train .
S-line accomplishes this through two assumptions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- groups of articles on train stations are named in a predictable manner ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- redirects are cheap .
With Amtrak , it &apos; s done this way :
When a system has uniform naming , you may be able to get away with a default case and only one or two exceptions , as in : Template : LUL lines :
If a change is made which alters \ / adds parameters names that template must be updated to reflect the new situation .
Note that , in the above CTA example , the previous and oneway1 parameters could have been omitted from the Purple and Pink line entries , but were left in for consistency &apos; s sake .

Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago .
It is said that they were there at the time of the arrival of the first Portuguese ships during the 16th century . These creatures are claimed to have existed as recently as the late 19th century .
They were surprised at the recovery of a nearly complete skeleton of a hominin -LRB- the name of the tribe -LRB- like a biological familly -RRB- to which humans also belong -RRB- . They called it LB1 because it was unearthed inside the Liang Bua Cave .
Gerd van den Bergh , a paleontologist working with the fossils , reported hearing of the Ebu Gogo ten years before the fossil discovery .
Local geology suggests that a volcanic eruption on Flores approximately 12,000 years ago was responsible for the end of H. floresiensis and animals that lived on the island . The elephant Stegodon also became extinct at this time .
On the nearby island of Sumatra , there are reports of a 1-1 .5 m tall humanoid , the Orang Pendek which might be related to H. floresiensis .
They are dated from 95,000 to 13,000 years ago . They are found in the same archeological layer as an elephant of the extinct genus Stegodon .
The specimens are not fossilized and have been described as having `` the consistency of wet blotting paper &apos; &apos; ; once exposed , the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug up .
The remains were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores by an Australian-Indonesian team of archaeologists in 2003 . Archaeologist Mike Morwood and colleagues were looking for evidence of the original human migration of H. sapiens from Asia to Australia .
A study of three bits of bones from the hand -LRB- or carpal bones -RRB- showed that they were similar to the carpal bones of a chimpanzee or an early hominin such as Australopithecus .
Researchers hope to find preserved mitochondrial DNA to compare with samples from similarly unfossilised specimens of Homo neanderthalensis and H. sapiens .
A study of the bones and joints of the arm , shoulder , and legs also concluded that H. floresiensis was more similar to early humans and apes than modern humans .
Archaeologist Mike Morwood and colleagues who found the remains published research to say that they think the individuals belong to a new species , H. floresiensis , within the taxonomic tribe of Hominini .
Other members of this tribe are human -LRB- the only living member of the genus Homo -RRB- , bonobo -LRB- genus Pan -RRB- , and chimpanzee -LRB- genus Pan -RRB- ; their ancestors ; and the extinct line of their common ancestor .
This makes it the longest lasting non-modern human . It also lived longer than the Neanderthals -LRB- H. neanderthalensis -RRB- , which became extinct about 24,000 years ago .
The discoverers also say that H. floresiensis might have lived at the same time as modern humans -LRB- Homo sapiens -RRB- on Flores .
Gregory Forth hypothesized that H. floresiensis may have survived longer in other parts of Flores to become the source of the Ebu Gogo stories told among the local people .
An arm bone which they think belongs to H. floresiensis is about 74,000 years old .
A study of three bits of bones from the hand -LRB- or carpal bones -RRB- showed that they were similar to the carpal bones of a chimpanzee or an early hominin such as Australopithecus . They were also different from the bones of modern humans .
The stories say that Ebu Gogo were small , hairy , language-poor cave dwellers that are the same size as the Homo Floresiensis .
Because of this , the discoverers of H. floresiensis think that the species , or its ancestors , must have reached the isolated island by water transport around 100,000 years ago -LRB- or , if they are H. erectus , then about 1 million years ago -RRB- .
In 2009 , the publication of a cladistic analysis and a study comparing body sizes gave further support for the theory that H. floresiensis and Homo sapiens are separate species .
Other animals that lived on the island at that time were giant rats , Komodo dragons , and even larger species of lizards .
Because of a deep neighboring strait , Flores remained isolated during the Wisconsin glaciation -LRB- the most recent glacial period -RRB- .
Two studies of the bones published in 2007 both reported evidence to support species status for H. floresiensis .
Excavations done after that recovered seven additional skeletons , dating from 38,000 to 13,000 years ago .

The character for this new meaning of `` chopsticks &apos; &apos; -LRB- ç -RRB- for kuÃ i has the semantic element of bamboo added to the character meaning `` fast &apos; &apos; kuÃ i -LRB- å `` -RRB- .
The English word `` chopstick &apos; &apos; seems to come from Chinese Pidgin English , a pidgin where `` chop chop &apos; &apos; meant quickly .
Jeo can not be used alone .
It is a word made of different parts ; it has the phonetic part of &apos; &apos; å `` &apos; &apos; , which means quick , and a semantic part , ç `` , meaning bamboo .
This is equal to 1.7 billion cubic metres of timber -- about 25 million fully grown trees .

Compared with the rounded Romanesque style , the pointed arch of the Early English Gothic looks more elegant and , more importantly , is better at distributing the weight of the stonework above it . This makes it possible to span higher and wider gaps using narrower columns .
Lancet arches are a sign of the style .
The Lancet openings of windows and arcades are often grouped in twos or threes .
Pointed arches were used for nave arcade , the doorways and lancet windows .
The mullions then branch out and cross , intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called tracery .
As with the gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires .
In areas of Southern England using flint architecture , elaborate decoration in flint was used , especially in the wool churches of East Anglia .
The high walls and vaulted stone roofs were often supported by flying buttresses : half arches which transmit the outward thrust of the superstructure to supports or buttresses , usually on the outside of the building .
The clearest sign of the Early English period was the pointed arch known as the lancet .
Elaborate windows are subdivided by closely-spaced parallel mullions -LRB- vertical bars of stone -RRB- .
The various styles are seen at their best in the cathedrals , abbey churches and college buildings .
At York Minster there are , in the north transept , a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters , each fifty feet high and still have their ancient glass .
English Gothic is the name of the architectural style that was very popular in England from about 1180 until about 1520 .
The windows are narrow by comparison to their height and are without tracery .
This is seen throughout Salisbury Cathedral where there are groups of two lancet windows lining the nave and groups of three lining the clerestory .
This evolution of decorated tracery is often used to subdivide the period into an earlier `` Geometric &apos; &apos; and later `` Curvilinear &apos; &apos; period .
Some of the earliest examples of the Perpendicular Period , dating from 1360 , are found at Gloucester Cathedral , where the masons of the cathedral would seem to have been far in advance of those in other towns ; the fan-vaulting in the cloisters is particularly fine .
Buttresses and wall surfaces are likewise divided up into vertical panels .
Decorated architecture has window tracery .
It is a distinctive characteristic of the cathedrals of England that all but one of them show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years .
At its purest the style was simple and austere , emphasising the height of the building , as if aspiring heavenward .
Examples : Salisbury Cathedral , Whitby Abbey , the nave and transept of Wells Cathedral -LRB- 1225 â &apos; &apos; 1240 -RRB- .
By using the pointed arch , walls could become less massive and window openings could be larger and grouped more closely together . This gave a more open , airy and graceful building .
Examples : the east ends of Lincoln Cathedral and Carlisle Cathedral , and the west fronts of York Minster and Lichfield Cathedral .
This is particularly obvious in the design of windows , which became very large , sometimes of immense size , with slimmer stone mullions than in earlier periods . This allowed more scope for stained glass craftsmen .
Some of the finest features of this period are the magnificent timber roofs ; hammerbeam roofs , such as those of Westminster Hall -LRB- 1395 -RRB- , and Christ Church Hall , Oxford , appeared for the first time .

This means that the 30 % of the energy is lost to the environment .
In the United States , in everyday usage the SEER is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices , as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode .
The input , , to the device is heat , or the heat-content of a fuel that is consumed .
The thermal efficiency is a dimensionless performance measure of a thermal device such as an internal combustion engine , a boiler , or a furnace , for example .
Due to inefficiencies such as friction , heat loss , and other factors , thermal efficiencies are typically much less than 100 % .
So , for a boiler that produces 210 kW -LRB- or 700,000 BTU \ / h -RRB- output for each 300 kW -LRB- or 1,000,000 BTU \ / h -RRB- heat-equivalent input , its thermal efficiency is 210 \ / 300 = 0.70 , or 70 % .
When expressed as a percentage , the thermal efficiency must be between 0 % and 100 % .
For example , a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25 % thermal efficiency , and a large coal-fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 36 % .
When transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy , the thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the percentage of energy that is transformed into work .
For energy-conversion heating devices their peak steady-state thermal efficiency is often stated , e.g. , ` this furnace is 90 % efficient &apos; , but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency -LRB- AFUE -RRB- .
In a combined cycle plant thermal efficiencies are approaching 60 % .
The ` thermal efficiency &apos; is sometimes called the energy efficiency .
Because the input heat normally has a real financial cost , a memorable , generic definition of thermal efficiency is
The desired output is mechanical work , , or heat , , or possibly both .
An electric resistance heater has a thermal efficiency of at or very near 100 % , so , for example , 1500W of heat are produced for 1500W of electrical input .
When comparing heating units , such as a 100 % efficient electric resistance heater to an 80 % efficient natural gas-fueled furnace , an economic analysis is needed to determine the most cost-effective choice .
Thermal efficiency is defined as

Afterwards he said his riding was never the same , because he always be in pain , especially while climbing .
During the next 15 years , various racers improved the record to more than 56 km .
In the time trial , he overtook the five-time Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil .
The record was unbeaten until 1984 , when Francesco Moser broke it using a specially designed bicycle .
Many of his former helpers have worked in his bicycle factory and join him during recreational bike tours .
In 2000 he was chosen Belgian `` Sports Figure of the Century &apos; &apos; .
When Chris Boardman had another go at Merckx &apos; s reinstated record in 2000 , he beat it by slightly more than 10 metres at sea level . But , Merckx had raced a full road season winning the Tour , Giro and four Classics , while Boardman was a time trial specialist who had retired from road racing and had prepared specially for the 2000 Hour Record .
Finally , he won 17 six-day track races , often with Patrick Sercu .
Merckx is known as a quiet and modest person .
He lost almost 30 kg in the process , and started cycling again , but only for leisure .

The third was to destroy the ability of the opposing navy to wage war at sea .
This was inconclusive -LRB- neither side won -RRB- , and was followed by a series of small ship actions -LRB- the battle of the Espero convoy , battle of Cape Spada -RRB- during the autumn .
On the following day , Italian bombers attacked Malta on what was to be the first of many raids .
Following the battle of Crete in the summer of 1941 , the Royal Navy got the better of things in the central Mediterranean in a series of successful convoy attacks , -LRB- such as the Duisburg convoy and the Battle of Cape Bon -RRB- until the events around the First Battle of Sirte and the Raid on Alexandria in December swung the balance of power in the Axis favor .
Outside of the Pacific ocean , the Mediterranean saw the largest conventional naval warfare during the war .
The first was to attack the supply lines of the other side .
For the most part , the campaign was fought between the forces of the Italian Royal Navy -LRB- Regia Marina -RRB- , supported by other Axis naval forces , and the forces of the British Royal Navy , supported by other Allied naval forces .
On 10 June 1940 , Italy declared war on Britain and France .
But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armor . All Italian warships lacked radar for most of the war , although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that Italian warships were equipped with good `` rangefinder &apos; &apos; and `` fire-control &apos; &apos; systems .
Each side had three overall goals in this battle .
Italian warships had a general reputation as well-designed and good-looking .
In Sept 1943 with the Italian collapse and the surrender of Italian fleet , naval actions in Mediterranean became restricted to actions against U-boats and by small craft in the Adriatic and Aegean seas .
In November , the RN mounted an aerial attack on the Italian fleet in Taranto harbor , crippling 3 capital ships and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean .
The first clash between the rival fleets , the Battle of Calabria , took place on 9 July 1940 , just four weeks after the start of hostilities .
The second was to keep open its own supply lines , the Axis to their own armies in North Africa and the Allies to supply the island of Malta .
The Battle of the Mediterranean was the name given to the naval campaign fought in the Mediterranean Sea during World War II .
A series of hard fought convoy battles -LRB- Second Battle of Sirte in March , Operations Harpoon and Vigorous in June , and Operation Pedestal in August -RRB- were victories for the Axis but ensured Malta &apos; s survival , until the Allies regained the advantage in November 1942 .
In addition , whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act , Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters -LRB- Supermarina -RRB- .
In particular , Allied forces struggled to supply and retain the key naval and air base of Malta .

In practice , however , the definition means that high-precision realizations of the second should compensate for the effects of the ambient temperature -LRB- black-body radiation -RRB- within which atomic clocks operate and extrapolate accordingly to the value of the second as defined above .
The Earth &apos; s motion was described in Newcomb &apos; s Tables of the Sun , which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made between 1750 and 1892 .
The revised definition would seem to imply that the ideal atomic clock would contain a single caesium atom at rest emitting a single frequency .
Under the International System of Units , the second is currently defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom .
Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV , they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth , from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred , in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock .
Though SI prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second -LRB- such as â kilosecondâ , or one thousand seconds -RRB- , such units are rarely used in practice .

Bing cherries are used almost exclusively for fresh market .
Bing cherries are high in anti-oxidants .

The Bing remains a major cultivar in Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia .
A wet climate is required for the harvest of the bing cherry .
He went back to China in 1889 for a visit .
Some say Ah Bing developed the cultivar , others that it was developed by Lewelling and named in Bing &apos; s honor due to his long service as orchard foreman .
It is the most produced variety of sweet cherry in the United States .
Ah Bing was reportedly born in China and immigrated to the U.S. in about 1855 .
Due to the restrictions of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 he never returned to the United States .
He worked as a foreman in the Lewelling family fruit orchards in Milwaukie for about 35 years , supervising other workers and caring for trees .
Bings are large , dark and firm cherries that ship well , but will crack open if exposed to rain near harvest .
However , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that these are yet unproven claims .
The cultivar was created as a crossbred graft from the Republican cherry in 1875 by Oregon horticulturist Seth Lewelling and his Manchurian Chinese foreman Ah Bing , for whom the cultivar is named .

It is popularly believed that Pavlov always signalled the food by ringing a bell .
Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlovâ s contemporaries Vladimir Bekhterev and John B. Watson , until Thomas found several references that clearly said Pavlov did , indeed , use a bell .
He noticed that the dogs tended to salivate before food was actually delivered to their mouths , and set out to investigate this `` psychic secretion &apos; &apos; , as he called it .
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was an enthusiastic advocate of the importance of Pavlov &apos; s work for philosophy of mind .
It is less widely known that Pavlov &apos; s experiments on the conditional reflex included children , some of whom apparently underwent surgical procedures , similar to the dogs , for the collection of saliva .
The phrase `` Pavlov &apos; s dog &apos; &apos; is often used to describe someone who merely reacts to a situation rather than using critical thinking .
Pavlov &apos; s research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science , but also popular culture .
In the 1890s , Pavlov was investigating the gastric function of dogs by externalizing a salivary gland so he could collect , measure , and analyze the saliva and what response it had to food under different conditions .
Catania did not believe Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his famous experiments .

Pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in Aldous Huxley &apos; s dystopian novel , Brave New World , and also to a large degree in Thomas Pynchon &apos; s Gravity &apos; s Rainbow .

Cyclone -LRB- or Hurricane -RRB- Catarina was an extraordinarily rare tropical cyclone , forming in the southern Atlantic Ocean in March 2004 .
A South Atlantic tropical cyclone is an unusual form of weather event .
On April 10 , 1991 , what was either a strong tropical depression or a weak tropical storm formed in the eastern South Atlantic , recorded by weather satellites off the coast of Angola .
It organized and appeared to become a tropical depression on January 18th .
A small area of convection developed on a trough of low pressure in mid-January off Brazil .
It reached a peak on the 13th , and dissipated two days later , drifting west-southwestward from where it formed .
While under study , the system was referred to as 90L Invest .
Just after becoming a hurricane , it hit the southern coast of Brazil in the state of Santa Catarina on the evening of March 28 , with winds estimated near 180 km \ / h -LRB- 112 mph -RRB- , making it a Category 2 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale .
The shear would eventually cause the system to dissipate later that night .
The depression moved inland on the 20th as a circulation with no convection , and dissipated the next day over Brazil , where it caused heavy rains and flooding .
A small area of convection 600 miles southeast of Rio de Janeiro moved into an area of low wind shear and barely 26 Â C warm waters on February 23 , 2006 .
If there was ever a `` hurricane season &apos; &apos; in the south Atlantic , it would most likely happen during the opposite of the north Atlantic season , from December to May with mid-March being the peak when the oceans are warmest in the Southern Hemisphere .
Of the few South Atlantic tropical cyclones that have existed , this was the only one in the eastern Atlantic .
Located 150 n miles southeast of Salvador , Brazil , it weakened as upper level shear , normal for the basin , prevailed .
These characteristics were operationally recognized for three hours before high shear began to tear the system apart , just short of the six hours required to be officially declared a tropical depression .
The next morning , it had a small amounts of convection near the center and well-defined bands , and the system , either a weak tropical storm or a strong tropical depression , likely reached its peak .
The cyclone killed 3-10 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in Brazil .

At most oppositions its magnitude is around + 11.0 , which is less than the minimum brightness of Vesta , Ceres or Pallas .
Another difference is that Interamnia &apos; s perihelion is at the other side of the perihelia of the `` big four &apos; &apos; , so that at Interamnia at perihelion is actually closer to the Sun than Ceres and Pallas are at the same longitude .
Even at a near-perihelion opposition its magnitude is only around + 9.9 , which is over four magnitudes lower than Vesta .
It is the fifth heaviest asteroid after Ceres , Vesta , Pallas and Hygiea , and scientists think that it makes up 2.0 % of the mass of the whole asteroid belt .
This also strongly suggests that Interamnia is big enough to have fully withstood all the collisions that have happened in the asteroid belt since the Solar System was made .
Its very dark surface and fairly far distance form the Sun means Interamnia can never be seen with 10x50 binoculars .
704 Interamnia is a very big asteroid . Scientists think it is 350 kilometers wide .

Kinorhynchans are segmented , limbless animals , with a body consisting of a head , neck , and a trunk of eleven segments .
These spines are used for movement , withdrawing the head and pushing forward , then gripping the substrate with the spines while drawing up the body .
Smaller ganglia are also located in the lateral and dorsal portions of each segment , but do not form distinct cords .
The larvae are free-living , but little else is known of their reproductive process .
Unlike some similar invertebrates , they do not have external cilia , but instead have a number of spines along the body , plus up to seven circles of spines around the head .
It consists of a ventral nerve cord , with one ganglion in each segment , and an anterior nerve ring surrounding the pharynx .
A pair of gonads are located in the mid-region of the trunk , and open to pores in the final segment .
Their closest relatives are thought to be the phyla Loricifera and Priapulida .

In 1618 , two Imperial governors and their secretary were thrown from Prague Castle , which started the Thirty Years War .
These two event , particularly in 1618 , were called the Defenestration of Prague and gave rise to the word and the idea .
The word comes from the Latin de - -LRB- down or away from -RRB- and fenestra -LRB- window or opening -RRB- .
Defenestration is the action of throwing someone or something out of a window .

The exact definition of an emergency , the agencies involved and the rules followed , depend on the jurisdiction , and this is usually set by the government , whose agencies -LRB- emergency services -RRB- are responsible for emergency planning and handling .
An emergency is a situation in which a risk to health , life , property or environment is about to happen .
To grow a thicker and tougher shell required new ways to supply the embryo with oxygen , as diffusion alone was not enough .
After the egg developed these structures , further sophistication allowed amniotes to lay much bigger eggs in much drier habitats .
The skeletal remains of amniotes can be identified from their Labyrinthodont ancestors by their having at least two pairs of sacral ribs , a sternum in the pectoral girdle -LRB- some amniotes have lost it -RRB- and an astragalus bone in the ankle .
New habits and heavier bodies meant further evolution for the amniotes , both in behavior and anatomy .
In anapsids -LRB- turtles -RRB- there are none , in synapsids -LRB- mammals and their extinct relatives -RRB- there is one , and in most diapsids -LRB- non-anapsid reptiles , including dinosaurs and birds -RRB- there are two .
Their eggs could survive out of the water . This let amniotes move into environments that had less water .
The oldest known fossil synapsid is Protoclepsydrops from about 320 million years ago , while the oldest known sauropsid is probably Paleothyris , in the order Captorhinida , from the Middle Pennsylvanian epoch -LRB- about 306-312 million years ago -RRB- .
Very early in the evolutionary history of amniotes , they split into two main lines , the synapsids and the sauropsids , both of which persist into the modern era .
In amniotes the inner anatomy of the egg has evolved further and new structures have developed to take care of the gas exchanges between the embryo and the atmosphere , as well as dealing with the waste problems .
The amniotes moved across the Earth . Most vertebrates that live on land are amniotes , as are most of the air-breathing animals of the sea .
One can assume the ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places , as such modest-sized animals would not have difficulty finding depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the ancient forests , and dry conditions were probably not the main reason why the soft shell emerged .
There are three main lines of amniotes , which may be distinguished by the structure of the skull and in particular the number of temporal fenestrae -LRB- openings -RRB- behind the eye .
The first amniotes , such as Casineria , looked like small lizards . They evolved about 340 million years ago , in the Mississippian or Lower Carboniferous .
Real growth was not possible , however , until they stopped relying on small invertebrates as their main food source and started to eat plants or other vertebrates , or returned to the water .
In fish and amphibians there is only one inner membrane , also called an embryonic membrane .
Bigger eggs allowed for bigger offspring , and bigger adults could produce bigger eggs , so amniotes grew bigger than their ancestors .

Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles -LRB- the ` war guilt &apos; clause -RRB- declared Germany and its allies responsible for all ` loss and damage &apos; of the Allies during the war and set up the basis for reparations .
There was large debate about the justice and likely impact of the reparations decided .
In addition , the Young Plan divided the yearly payment , set at two billion gold marks -LRB- US $ 473 million -RRB- , into two parts : one part equal to one third of the sum and could not be postponed and a postponable part for the remaining two-thirds .
John Maynard Keynes resigned form the British Treasury in 1919 to protest this high sum of money demanded .
Under strong pressure , the French left Rhineland in June 1930 .
The Germans complained further that payments under the Dawes Plan were too high , the Young Plan of 1928 was set up and the Germans were not required to pay higher than 2.5 billion until 1988 .
Sally Marks , an American historian , also thought that Germany could pay the reparations . She said that the Germans paid the reparations in full and on time as long as the French occupied DÃ 1 \ / 4 sseldorf in 1921 , but stopped after the French were no longer stationed there in 1922 .
In May 1929 , the Young Plan reduced further payments to 112 billion gold marks -LRB- $ 28.35 billion over a period of 59 years , which was 1988 -RRB- .
Germany stopped to pay the reparations after Hitler &apos; s Nazi Party took power in 1933 . About one-eighth of the reparations paid by then .
The 1924 Dawes Plan changed Germany &apos; s reparation payments .
In 2008 , a British historain Richard J. Evans said that the German government was responsible for the hyperinflation as they preferred this to paying reparations . The Germans won the world &apos; s pity , and after that , the French were forced to agree to the Dawes Plan of April 1924 , which lowered the reparations .
As a `` quiet fight &apos; &apos; in the Ruhr , the German government began the hyperinflation that destroyed the German economy in 1923 .
Under this new plan , Germany paid 1 billion marks in 1924 and reached the total of 2.25 billion by 1927 .

Several new recurring characters were introduced in the sixth season .

Thus , people are unaware of the fact that they have buried memories or traumatic experiences .
The origin of Freud &apos; s early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to Josef Breuer .
However , patients were generally unconvinced that Freud &apos; s clinical procedure indicated actual sexual abuse .
Classically , the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk in free association and to talk about dreams .
The Oedipus conflict was described as a state of psychosexual development and awareness .
He wrote several articles on the antidepressant qualities of the drug and he was influenced by friend and confidant Wilhelm Fliess , who recommended cocaine for the treatment of `` nasal reflex neurosis &apos; &apos; .
Freud also argued that the act of repression did not take place within a person &apos; s consciousness .
He noted finding many cases in which apparent memories of childhood sexual abuse were based more on imagination than on real events .
Freud made arguments about the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought and behavior .
Reports of addiction and overdose began to come from many parts of the world . Freud &apos; s medical reputation became somewhat tarnished because of this early ambition .
Freud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique .
However , following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again .
Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously , and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom .
The preconscious was described as a layer between conscious and unconscious thought ; its contents could be accessed with a little effort .
Freud also believed that the libido developed in individuals by changing its object , a process called sublimation .
He found that while nursing her dying father she had developed a number of transitory symptoms , including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs , which he also diagnosed as hysterical .
In his later work , Freud proposed that the human psyche could be divided into three parts : Id , ego , and super-ego .
He further argued that , as humans develop , they become fixated on different and specific objects through their stages of development -- first in the oral stage -LRB- exemplified by an infant &apos; s pleasure in nursing -RRB- , then in the anal stage -LRB- exemplified by a toddler &apos; s pleasure in evacuating his or her bowels -RRB- , then in the phallic stage .
After Freud wrote his first book , he got married to Martha Bernays .
He reported that even after a supposed `` reproduction &apos; &apos; of sexual scenes the patients assured him emphatically of their disbelief .
Freud developed a theory of the human mind -LRB- its organization and operations -RRB- . He also had a theory that human behavior both conditions and results from how the mind is organised .
The goal of Freudian therapy , or psychoanalysis , was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into consciousness in order to free the patient from suffering distorted emotions .
Freud argued that children then passed through a stage in which they fixated on the mother as a sexual object -LRB- known as the Oedipus Complex -RRB- but that the child eventually overcame and repressed this desire because of its taboo nature .
Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent .
The rational Ego attempts to get a balance between the impractical hedonism of the Id and the equally impractical moralism of the Super-ego ; it is the part of the psyche that is usually reflected most directly in a person &apos; s actions .
The Id is the impulsive , child-like portion of the psyche that operates on the `` pleasure principle &apos; &apos; and only takes into account what it wants and disregards all consequences .
One key factor in the operation of the unconscious is ` repression &apos; .
Freud also recommended cocaine to many of his close family and friends .
In November 1880 Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman -LRB- Bertha Pappenheim -RRB- for a persistent cough which he diagnosed as hysterical .
`` I found in myself a constant love for my mother , and jealousy of my father .
Freud discussed this model in the 1920 essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle , and fully elaborated upon it in The Ego and the Id -LRB- 1923 -RRB- .
Despite this change in his explanatory model , Freud always recognized that some neurotics had in fact been sexually abused by their fathers .
Historian of psychology Mark Altschule concluded , `` It is difficultâ &apos; &apos; or perhaps impossibleâ &apos; &apos; to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious thought as not only real but of the highest importance &apos; &apos; .
He argued that humans are born `` polymorphously perverse &apos; &apos; , meaning that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure .
During the late 1890s Freud , who never abandoned his belief in the sexual cause of neuroses , began to emphasize fantasies built around the Oedipus complex as the primary cause of hysteria and other neurotic symptoms .
Freud originally thought childhood sexual abuse was a general explanation for the origin of neuroses , but he abandoned this so-called `` seduction theory &apos; &apos; .
Freud famously proposed that unconscious memories of infantile sexual abuse were at the root of the psychoneuroses .
Freud believed that many people repress painful memories deep into their unconscious mind .
The repressive or dormant latency stage of psychosexual development comes before the sexually mature genital stage of psychosexual development .
I now consider this to be a universal event in childhood . &apos; &apos;
He explicitly discussed several patients whom he knew to have been abused .
He theorised that personality is developed by a person &apos; s childhood experiences .
Freud believed that humans were driven by two conflicting central desires : the life drive -LRB- survival , propagation , hunger , thirst , and sex -RRB- and the death drive -LRB- Thanatos -RRB- .
He used the Oedipus conflict to point out how much he believed that people desire incest and must repress that desire .
Freud developed his first topology of the psyche in The Interpretation of Dreams -LRB- 1899 -RRB- in which he proposed that the unconscious exists and described a method for gaining access to it .
Freud hoped his model was universally valid and so turned to ancient mythology and ethnography for comparative material .
Freud sought to anchor this pattern of development in the dynamics of the mind .
Freud is important in psychology because he studied the unconscious . The unconscious is a part of a person &apos; s mind which he is not aware of , and which he can not control easily .
Freud named his new theory the Oedipus complex after the famous Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex by Sophocles .
This led him to favor certain clinical techniques for trying to help cure mental illness .
He found that when , with his encouragement , she told fantasy stories her condition improved , and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881 .

Adaptive immunity is triggered in vertebrates when a pathogen evades the innate immune system and generates a threshold level of antigen .
It is adaptive immunity because the body &apos; s immune system prepares itself for future challenges .
The adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens . The system mounts stronger attacks each time a particular pathogen is encountered .
The adaptive immune system is made of specialized cells and processes which kill pathogens or prevent their attack .
The adaptive immune system is switched on by the evolutionarily older innate immune system . This older system is non-specific , whereas the adaptive system is tailored to specific targets .

When humans go out to get food or homes , that is studied in `` economics &apos; &apos; , but when non-humans do it , that is `` ecology &apos; &apos; , though it is clear that there are motivations , methods and certainly bodily needs in common .
See value of Earth article for that and other examples of this extreme case of ecosystem valuation - biosphere valuation .
Ecology itself is also human perception , and such related concepts as a food chain are constructed by humans to help them understand ecosystems .
Studies compiled by Robert Costanza in the 1990s argued strongly that even just considering the most basic seventeen of these services , the combined value of the ecosystems of the earth was worth more -LRB- US $ 33T -RRB- each year than the whole human exchange economy -LRB- US $ 25T -RRB- at that time -LRB- 1995 -RRB- .
More complex arguments in ecosystem valuation regard nature &apos; s services and the assignment of values in a service economy to all that nature does `` for humans &apos; &apos; .
Some versions of conflict theory focus on the role of resource scarcity in sparking or propagating human conflicts - in effect holding that the resources or ecosystems they fight over are being held so valuable that they are worth considerable risk of harm to control .
It may be anthropocentric to do so , since `` valuation &apos; &apos; more clearly refers to a human perception rather than being an `` objective &apos; &apos; attribute of the system perceived .
Considering `` valuation &apos; &apos; as an `` economic not ecological issue &apos; &apos; reflects the way these fields divide of the activities of humans versus non-humans in `` making a living &apos; &apos; .
Ecosystem valuation is a widely used tool to find out the impact of human activities on an environmental system . It is done by giving an economic value to an ecosystem or its ecosystem services .
Thus , a price can be put on the natural capital of an ecosystem based on the price of natural resources it yields each year .
It is done by giving an economic value to an ecosystem or its ecosystem services .
Since animals do not put explicit prices on ecosystems they use , but do behave as if they are valuable , e.g. by defending turf or access to water , it is mostly a matter of definition whether ecology should include valuation as an issue .
In many cases by those who hold that markets and pricing exist independently of any individual human observers and `` users &apos; &apos; , and especially those who deem markets to be `` out of control &apos; &apos; , ecosystem valuation is considered a -LRB- marginal , ignored -RRB- part of economics .
This is at least a relative notion of value and value at risk applied to ecosystem .
Methods to estimate the value of ecosystem services which can not be derived from market prices include `` stated preference &apos; &apos; methods and `` revealed preference &apos; &apos; methods .
Natural capital and individual capital are studied ecology as living systems , however , this does not extend to the economics of valuation by which they are related :
Stated preference methods , such as the contingent valuation method ask people for their willingness to pay for a certain ecosystem -LRB- service -RRB- .
Such valuation , and that of the effectiveness of various environmental health measures that affect the value of life and quality of life , are usually thought to be part of economics .
The simplest form of ecosystem valuation is that one looks at an ecosystem as if its ecological yield had the same value as it would be on commodity markets . That means one looks at the value of water , wood , fish or game , that is produced in that ecosystem .
In Natural Capitalism , 1999 , Paul Hawken , Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins advanced an argument to assign the value of Earth in current currency .
Revealed preference methods , such as hedonic pricing and the travel cost method , use a relation with a market good or service to estimate the willingness-to-pay for the service .
Other studies have focused on the marginal value of ecosystem changes , which can be used in cost-benefit analysis of environmental policies .

If a Church recognizes that another Church , with which it lacks bonds of pastoral governance , shares with it some of the beliefs and essential practices of Christianity , it may speak of `` partial communion &apos; &apos; between it and the other Church .
The term Communion comes from Latin communio -LRB- sharing in common -RRB- .
In a special way the term communion is applied to sharing in the Eucharist .
In addition , the noun is found in some manuscripts -LRB- used for producing the English translation known as the King James Version , but not for more recent translations -RRB- in Ephesians 3 : 9 .
An example is the Anglican Communion .
But the term `` full communion &apos; &apos; is often used as well in that sense that these Christian Churches are not united , but have only an arrangement where members of each Church have certain rights within the other .
But the term is also used of a group of Christian Churches that have this close relationship of communion with each other .
The corresponding term in Greek is Î Î Î Î 1 \ / 2 Ï Î 1 \ / 2 Î Î , which is often translated as `` fellowship &apos; &apos; .
The communion of saints is the relationship that , according to the belief of Christians , exists between them as people made holy by their link with Christ .
If the relationship between the Churches is complete , involving fulness of `` those bonds of communion - faith , sacraments and pastoral governance - that permit the Faithful to receive the life of grace within the Church &apos; &apos; , it is called full communion .
This relationship is generally understood to mean not only those still in earthly life , but also to those who have gone past death to be `` at home with the Lord &apos; &apos; -LRB- 2 Corinthians 5 : 8 -RRB- .
In the Bible , the Greek term Î Î Î Î 1 \ / 2 Ï Î 1 \ / 2 Î Î is only used in the New Testament . It does not appear at all in the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint .

It officially started on May 15 , 1985 in the eastern Pacific , and on June 1 , 1985 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1985 .
However , the anticipated exhaustion of the old list was averted , meaning that the east Pacific has never exhausted its list .

As it finished the loop and left the cover of the anticyclone , Xina started falling apart .
This is the same list used for the 1979 season , except for the added names .
Of those , 22 attained tropical storm intensity , 12 reaching hurricane intensity and 8 becoming major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale .
Cool waters took their toll on the cyclone , and Xina dissipated on November 5 .
The 1985 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology .
Just after peaking as a Category 2 hurricane on the hurricane scale , Waldo made landfall southwest of CuliacÃ n . Waldo rapidly dissipated over land .

Xina began to start tracing out a huge oblong loop beneath an anticyclone .
It strengthened into Tropical Storm Xina early October 27 .
It threatened the islands enough to prompt a hurricane watch , which means winds of 74 mph or higher are possible during the next 36 hours . However , the hurricane turned away .
Despite the activity , there were few notable systems this year .
Had the list of names not been extended , Xina would have been named `` Alpha &apos; &apos; instead .

Each Victoria line station apart from Pimlico was built as an interchange station and several existing stations were reâ `` arranged to allow for cross-platform interchange with it .
Supporters of Tottenham Hotspur -LRB- and the club itself -RRB- have campaigned for a surface station to be opened next to Northumberland Park Station , next to the line &apos; s depot .
In normal service , all trains run from Brixton to Seven Sisters . About three out of five continue to Walthamstow Central .
The train operator -LRB- driver -RRB- closes the train doors and presses a pair of `` start &apos; &apos; buttons . If the way ahead is clear , the ATO drives the train at a safe speed to the next station and stops there .
However , this would be expensive and can not currently be justified on cost-benefit reasons .
The official opening ceremony for the line took place at Victoria station on March 7 1969 . Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a commemorative plaque on the station concourse .
The replacement for the line &apos; s 1967 Tube Stock will be the 2009 Tube Stock built by Bombardier Transportation .
There was no opening ceremony for this . The normal timetable started on September 1 1968 .
This station would be on a large reversing loop with one platform .
Examples of these lower standards include narrower than usual platforms and undecorated ceilings at Walthamstow Central , Blackhorse Road and Tottenham Hale . This also affects lighting levels .
On the Tube map it is shown with a light blue color . It is the fourth busiest line on the London Underground network .
183 million people use the Victoria line each year .
This system has been in place since the line opened in 1968 . This makes the Victoria line the world &apos; s first full-scale automatic railway .
Barbara Castle , the Minister of Transport gave approval on August 4 1967 to build the Brixton extension .
The 1967 stock is now being replaced bit by bit from July 2009 as part of Transport for London &apos; s 5-year Â # 10 billion redevelopment project .
There was also a proposal for an extension from Victoria to Fulham Broadway station on the District line , but this was not included in the Bill .
This would provide an improvement in transport links , seen as essential if the club &apos; s wish to redevelop their ground and increase crowd capacity is to become a reality .
Information posters on the new trains state that , from early 2010 , there will be one new train introduced into full service every two weeks .
Each new platform built for the Victoria Line is 132.6 metres long .
Trains run every two minutes during peak periods -LRB- when its the busiest -RRB- .
These are currently being replaced by 2009 Tube Stock -LRB- see below -RRB- .
The concept of a new tube railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948 .
This would remove a critical capacity restriction by eliminating the need for trains to reverse at Brixton .
Each station was decorated with tiled motifs on seating recesses to differentiate them from each other .
During the construction of the Jubilee line in the late 1970s , the original motifs on Green Park station were replaced by motifs matching the new design for the Jubilee line platforms .
The first train left Walthamstow Central for Highbury &amp; Islington at about 6.30 am .
It is not clear from Transport for London &apos; s Five-Year Investment Programme whether these shortcomings are likely to be remedied .
At most stations between the up and down escalators there is a concrete staircase where an additional escalator could be installed , but has not been fitted .
After a short ceremony , she bought a 5d -LRB- old pence -RRB- ticket and traveled to Green Park . In new pence this would be about 2.08 p .
During the planning stages , it was known as Route C. Later , it was named the Victoria line after Victoria Station by David McKenna . This suggestion was seconded by Sir John Elliot .
When the line first opened it was served by a fleet of 8-car 1967 tube stock trains .
Later on , a number of cars of 1972 Mark I Tube Stock were adapted to work with the 1967 stock .
The first section opened was between Walthamstow Central and Highbury &amp; Islington .
However , a late decision in 1961 saw the line cut back to Walthamstow Central station . Until 1968 this station was called Walthamstow -LRB- Hoe Street -RRB- .
The first train was built in 2006 . Testing started in 2008 , and the rest of the fleet will be delivered between 2009 and 2012 .
All Victoria line stations were originally tiled in a light blue color .
The Victoria line was designed to get rid of build-ups of traffic on other lines , such as the Piccadilly line . It was also designed to have as many interchanges as possible , and all stations except Pimlico have an interchange with at least one other London Underground or National Rail line .
The construction work on the Walthamstowâ `` Victoria section began in 1962 . It continued until 1972 , when Pimlico station was opened .
The main purpose of the line was to relieve congestion in the central area .
The Bill described a line from Victoria to Walthamstow -LRB- Wood Street -RRB- .
Preparatory work started at a site on Bessborough Gardens near to Vauxhall Bridge Road in May 1967 . On June 28 1968 , Richard Marsh , then Minister of Transport approved the proposal to build a station at Pimlico .
The name `` Victoria line &apos; &apos; dates back to 1955 . The other suggestions were `` Walvic line &apos; &apos; -LRB- Walthamstow Central stationâ `` Victoria station -RRB- and `` Viking line &apos; &apos; -LRB- Victoria stationâ `` King &apos; s Cross station -RRB- .
This has been remedied at Brixton in 2004 and at Vauxhall in 2006 where an additional escalator has been installed in place of the fixed stairway .
The idea was looked into but Network Rail own the necessary land and need it for their own expansion plans .
If the Chelseaâ `` Hackney line is built then it will relieve a lot of congestion on the Victoria line . It will offer an alternative route across Central London between Victoria and King &apos; s Cross St. Pancras .
Later that year , the section between Highbury &amp; Islington and Warren Street was opened . Again there was no ceremony .
Over many years , heavy equipment has been installed in fenced-off sections at the ends of platforms owing to the lack of anywhere else to install them .
The Victoria line is part of the London Underground network . It is a deep-level underground metro line that runs from Brixton in the south of London to the Walthamstow Central in the north-east .
Princess Alexandra opened the Brixton extension on July 23 1971 . She made a journey from Brixton to Vauxhall .
A test tunnel from Tottenham to Manor House under Seven Sisters Road had been constructed in 1959 and this was later integrate into the running tunnels .
The signalling will also be replaced with a more modern ATO system from Westinghouse Rail Systems during the Victoria line upgrade .
For many years there have been proposals to extend southwards from Brixton one stop to Herne Hill .
It had been intended to build the line past Walthamstow Central to Wood Street -LRB- Walthamstow -RRB- , where it would come above ground to terminate next to the British Railways station .
It can cause severe congestion at peak times .
Each is made up of two four-car units .
The line has hump-backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they arrive and to then use this energy as they leave the stations .
Given that the current line is heavily overcrowding , this is the only extension proposal that has any realistic possibility of ever existing . Even so it would have to be seen to be effective at reducing overcrowding -LRB- by enabling trains to run more frequently -RRB- rather than adding to overcrowding to have any hope of being built .
Their names are derived from their staining characteristics ; for example , the most abundant granulocyte is the neutrophil granulocyte , which has neutrally-staining cytoplasmic granules .
Granulocytes are a category of white blood cells characterized by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm .
The term polymorphonuclear leukocyte often refers just to neutrophils , the most abundant of the granulocytes .
Other white blood cells which are not granulocytes are mainly lymphocytes and monocytes .

The Julian day system was introduced by astronomers to provide a single system of dates that could be used when working with different calendars and to unify different historical chronologies .
Almost 2.5 million Julian days have elapsed since the initial epoch .
The Julian day number can be considered a very simple calendar , where its calendar date is just an integer .
A Julian date of 2454115.05486 means that the date and Universal Time is Sunday 14 January 2007 at 13 : 18 : 59.9 .
JDN 2,400,000 was November 16 , 1858 .
Apart from the choice of the zero point and name , this Julian day and Julian date are not directly related to the Julian calendar , although it is possible to convert any date from one calendar to the other .
0.1 = 2.4 hours or 144 minutes or 8640 seconds 0.01 = 0.24 hours or 14.4 minutes or 864 seconds 0.001 = 0.024 hours or 1.44 minutes or 86.4 seconds 0.0001 = 0.0024 hours or 0.144 minutes or 8.64 seconds 0.00001 = 0.00024 hours or 0.0144 minutes or 0.864 seconds .
JD 2,500,000.0 will occur on August 31 , 2132 at noon UT .
It allows the time between any two dates in history to be computed by simple subtraction .
This is useful for reference , computations , and conversions .
Negative values can also be used , although those predate all recorded history .
The Julian day or Julian day number -LRB- JDN -RRB- is the number of days that have passed since the initial epoch defined as noon Universal Time -LRB- UT -RRB- Monday , January 1 , 4713 BC in the Julian calendar . That noon-to-noon day is counted as Julian day 0 .

The socialists wanted more promises from Schuschnigg before they were willing to side with him .
Instead the German troops were greeted by cheering Austrians with Hitler salute , Nazi flags and flowers .
On 9 March Schuschnigg announced a plebiscite on the independence of Austria for 13 March .
After the war , then allied-occupied Austria was recognized and treated as a separate country , but was not restored to sovereignty until the Austrian State Treaty and Austrian Declaration of Neutrality , both of 1955 , largely due to the rapid development of the Cold War and disputes between the Soviet Union and its former allies over its foreign policy .
In the evening , he arrived at Linz and was welcomed at the city hall .
The communists said they supported the Austrian government .
Schuschnigg realized that his new ministers were trying to take over from him .
However , the Nazis were well organised . Within hours they managed to take control of many parts of Vienna , including the Ministry of Internal Affairs -LRB- controlling the Police -RRB- .
As Miklas continued to refuse to appoint a Nazi government and Seyss-Inquart still could not send a telegram in the name of the Austrian government demanding German troops to restore order , Hitler became furious .
In some parts of Austria the referendum on the independence of Austria on 13 March was held despite the Wehrmacht &apos; s presence in Austria -LRB- it took up to 3 days to occupy every part of Austria -RRB- .
Hitler &apos; s car crossed the border in the afternoon at Braunau , his birthplace .
Not as tyrants have we come , but as liberators . &apos; &apos;
Officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received the voting ballot by hand -LRB- in contrast to a secret vote where the voting ballot is inserted into a closed box -RRB- .
Around midnight , after nearly all critical offices and buildings had fallen into Nazi hands in Vienna and the main political party members of the old government had been arrested , Miklas finally appointed Seyss-Inquart Chancellor .
Hitler later commented : `` Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods .
Also , the German Ministry of Propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order .
For instance , in the village of Innervillgraten a majority of 95 % voted for Austria &apos; s independence .
Austria remained part of the Third Reich until the end of World War II when a preliminary Austrian Government declared the Anschluss null und nichtig -LRB- null and void -RRB- on April 27 1945 .
Meanwhile , Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas refused to appoint SeyÃ - Inquart as Chancellor and asked other Austrian politicians instead .
Most historians agree that the result was not fixed , but the voting process was neither free nor secret .
On the morning of 12 March , the 8th Army of the German Wehrmacht crossed the German-Austrian border . They were not stopped by the Austrian Army .
The plebiscite was held on 10 April and officially recorded a support of 99.73 % of the voters .
I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people , but when I crossed the former frontier -LRB- into Austria -RRB- there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced .
Austria became the province of Ostmark , and Seyss-Inquart was appointed Governor .
Hitler said that the plebiscite would be subject to major fraud and that Germany would not accept it .
I can only say : even in death they can not stop lying .
The Anschluss was given immediate effect by a law on 13 March , subject to ratification by a plebiscite .
Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March , saying that he must hand over all power to the Austrian Nazis or face an invasion .
On 2 April 1938 , 200,000 Austrians gathered on the Heldenplatz -LRB- Square of Heroes -RRB- to hear Hitler proclaim the Austrian Anschluss .
To get support Schuschnigg allowed socialists and communists legally to appear in public again . The parties had been banned on 12 February 1934 in the Austrian Civil War .
At about 10 PM , well after Hitler had signed and issued the order for the invasion , GÃ ring and Hitler gave up on waiting and sent a forged telegram pretending to be a request by the Austrian Government for German troops to enter Austria .
Schuschnigg immediately said publicly that reports of riots were false .
On 31 October 2001 , Ole von Beust became First Mayor of Hamburg .
He has been a member of the ruling council of the Hamburg Land CDU since 1992 , and of the national ruling council of the CDU party since 1998 .
Beust had earlier dismissed Walter Wellinghausen , senator of the interior and Schill &apos; s most important official , without consulting Schill beforehand .
Carl-Friedrich Arp Ole Freiherr von Beust , generally called Ole von Beust , born 13 April 1955 , in Hamburg , Germany , was Ole von Beust First Mayor of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg from 31 October 2001 to 25 August 2010 , serving as President of the Bundesrat from 1 November 2007 on for one year .
In a later interview , Beust &apos; s father confirmed that his son is indeed homosexual .
Through his father he is a descendant of Saxon and Austrian statesman Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust .
However , since the CDU lost its absolute majority , it formed a coalition government with the Greens .
This was due to public allegations of misconduct on Wellinghausen &apos; s part .
He stated `` I have nothing against homosexuals &apos; &apos; .
In the press conference Schill held minutes after he had heard of his own dismissal , he spoke vaguely of `` homosexual relationships &apos; &apos; , a `` flat in an infamous hustler district &apos; &apos; and `` certain things happened that let one infer the occurrence of love acts &apos; &apos; between Beust and Roger Kusch , who Beust had appointed minister -LRB- in German city-states `` senator &apos; &apos; -RRB- of justice .
Schill however later affirmed Beust &apos; s version of the story , except for the accusations of blackmail , saying that he warned Beust to stay clear of nepotism , and that this had nothing to do with Beust &apos; s sexual orientation .
In 1971 von Beust became member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union -LRB- CDU -RRB- .
In a private conversation , Schill then demanded that Beust take back the dismissal , allegedly using personal threats .
In 1973 , after finishing high school , he worked for the CDU group in Hamburg &apos; s city-state parliament -LRB- `` BÃ 1 \ / 4 rgerschaft &apos; &apos; -RRB- , a position he held until he started to study law in 1975 at the University of Hamburg .
This was the first time since 1993 the city-state has had only a single ruling party .
On 19 August 2003 , Beust dismissed his vice-mayor Ronald Schill , causing a scandal .
On 18 July 2010 Ole von Beust declared his resignation effective 25 August .
The Hamburg elections of 29 February 2004 , ended with an unprecedented landslide victory for Ole von Beust and the CDU , with the party achieving absolute majority in the city-state &apos; s parliament .
His unprepared statement to the press quickly earned Schill an homophobic reputation .
In 1983 he successfully completed his studies and became an independent lawyer .
Thus , the CDU continued to be the strongest party in Hamburg .
`` This is all -- absolutely all &apos; &apos; , according to Beust .
A popular radio-station broadcast a song calling him `` Mega-Proll &apos; &apos; -LRB- mega redneck -RRB- and gay and lesbian associations protested vocally .
Beust himself considers his sexual orientation a private matter ; when asked directly he usually ironically refers the interviewer to his father .
The CDU gained 47.2 percent of the vote , a full 21-point increase from the previous election in September 2001 .
In the Hamburg elections of 24 February 2008 , the CDU gained 42.6 percent of the vote .
From 1977 until 1983 he was Hamburg president of the youth organization of his party .
He said he had no sexual relationship with Kusch , that they merely knew each other for 25 years and were good friends , and that Beust was Kusch &apos; s landlord .
Beust in turn stated that Schill threatened to make his alleged liaison with Kusch public under the premise that Beust intermingled public and private affairs .
Beust then decided to dismiss Schill as well .
Since 1978 Beust has been a member of the Hamburg city-state &apos; s parliament .
He was a finalist for the 2010 World Mayor prize .
He is the son of Achim Helge Freiherr von Beust and Hanna , nÃ e Wolff , who was considered half Jewish in Nazi Germany .
He was followed as mayor by Christoph Ahlhaus .
Between 1997 and 2001 , he was the Prime Minister of Poland .

On March 1 , 2001 , a moon of Camilla was found by A. Storrs , F. Vilas , R. Landis , E. Wells , C. Woods , B. Zellner , and M. Gaffey using the Hubble Space Telescope .
Apart from data in infobox , the inclination was found to be 3 Â 1 Â with respect to an axis pointing towards -LRB- Î , Î &apos; &apos; -RRB- = -LRB- + 55 Â , 75 Â -RRB- .
Given the ~ 10 Â uncertainty in the actual rotational axis of Camilla , one can say that the orbit &apos; s inclination is less than 10 Â .
Lightcurve analysis indicates that Camilla &apos; s pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates -LRB- Î , Î &apos; &apos; -RRB- = -LRB- + 51 Â , 72 Â -RRB- with a 10 Â uncertainty , which gives it an axial tilt of 29 Â .
Later sightings in September 2005 with the VLT allowed the determination of an orbit .
Assuming a similar density to the Camilla , this would give it a mass of about ~ 1.5 kg .

In practice however due to Wikipedia &apos; s open nature of being the ` The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit &apos; , articles are and will be created which do not follow Wikipedia &apos; s policies and guidelines fully but have the potential to do so .
It is frequently a better option to do one or more of the following :
This can cause problems , as frequently editors simply do not have time to fix articles within such a short time period .
Articles are frequently nominated for deletion because of their current state , not their potential as an encyclopedic entry .
These nominations can often result in de facto time limits of about seven days -LRB- changed from five in April 2009 -RRB- for an article to either improve , or be deleted and sometimes merged .
In cases where an article could have potential in the future but does not now , it should be merged or redirected appropriately if possible , so it can be easily re-created when potential is gained .
If an article is proposed for deletion and you think the article has potential to address the concerns raised , such as notability , then you can simply remove the template from the article .
Merging an article on a topic with narrow scope into an article with a larger scope can frequently be a good solution to issues of a topic not being notable or verifiable enough for its own Wikipedia article entry .
Deletion of a article can be one step backwards in creating an encyclopedic entry for a notable topic .
If an article is deleted by the proposed deletion process , it is possible to make a request to a administrator to undelete it , based on its potential for improvement and expansion .
There are several simple methods that can be used to help determine if an article has potential , even if it is relativity short .
Note however that an article should have immediate potential , as Wikipedia is not a crystal ball .
This will allow for editors in the long-term to improve the article to address all concerns .
It can also help to explain your aims for the article and its potential notability .
It suggests that if an article does not demonstrate notability , editors should make a good faith search for sources before deletion or merging .
These options help navigation and allow the encyclopedia to flow , while also encouraging long-term article expansion .
Frequently the concept can be applied when becoming involved with a variety of Wikipedia processes .
It is frequently a better option to do one or more of the following :
Time should be given for input from multiple editors to allow improvements to be made .
Wikipedia is constantly changing and evolving , and it is frequently better to think of the potential of an article as well as how it looks at present .
If you have just created an article and it is nominated for speedy deletion , it can be sensible to add the tag and then to state on the article &apos; s talk page that you are still working on the article .
An article could have potential if :
Often adding context to the article will help in the short-term to establish the potential of an encyclopedic entry on a topic .
Many articles are created on Wikipedia every day , most of which are a good faith effort by contributors to improve the encyclopedia .
If you are against a merge because you think the article &apos; s topic is notable enough for its own entry , it is sensible to explain why on the article &apos; s talk page .
However , merging an article which has potential to be successful as a standalone article in the long-run can constrain encyclopedia expansion , cause articles to specialise in one subject area , and possibly result in articles getting too long .
While encouraging planning and preparation when creating articles is desirable , contributors , particularly users new to Wikipedia , can not be expected to build an article perfectly at first attempt .
The concept of potential is recognized in the Notability guideline under # Articles not satisfying the notability guidelines .
Keeping articles with potential encourages editors , especially unregistered users , to be bold and improve the article to allow it to evolve over time .
It is polite to state -LRB- often on the article &apos; s talk page -RRB- why you think the article should be kept ; such as citing sources -LRB- often those on the internet -RRB- that the article can use giving the topic notability and making deletion unnecessary .
Having to re-create an article from scratch often takes a long time and can result in a long-term loss of encyclopedic information from Wikipedia .
Preferably the first revision of all new articles would be beefed up enough so the suitability of an article for inclusion in the encyclopedia could be assessed without needing to look at potential .
In most cases deletion of an article should be a last resort in the event that the article &apos; s topic is not notable and has no potential for its own encyclopedic entry on Wikipedia .
When discussing mergers it is also wise to think of the long-term , such as the possibility of an article getting too long .
Sometimes it will be suggested that an article be merged with another article .
It can also be helpful to quickly remove content of an article which is causing problems , and to add templates to the article as necessary .
In these cases it is helpful to alert the discussion that the article has potential to be made into a successful encyclopedic entry , and that more time is needed to improve the article .
Potential , not just current state relates to the debate on whether articles in the mainspace should be deleted , merged , or kept based on their current potential to be an encyclopedic entry , or as they are now .

This template allows the creation of subgroups that can be assigned to a list item within .
; oddstyle ; evenstyle : CSS styles to apply to the odd-numbered list items -LRB- list1 , list3 , etc -RRB- or even-numbered list items -LRB- list2 , list4 , etc -RRB- , respectively .
; liststyle : CSS styles to apply to all lists .
Format is inline .
Should usually be specified using em units .
Setting to disables automatic row striping .
The background color defaults to , but can be changed via the groupstyle parameter -LRB- see below -RRB- .
Typically used to set background color in order to achieve an alternating background color between odd and even-numbered lists .
At least one list parameter is required ; each additional list is displayed in a separate row of the table .
Normally , even rows get a light gray background for striping ; when this parameter is used , the odd rows receive the gray striping instead of the even rows .
The background color of the list items -LRB- and the entire table -RRB- defaults to , therefore it displays the same background color used in the parent navigation box .
The following is an example of Navbox subgroup used within a Navbox template .
; bodystyle : Specifies CSS styles to apply to the template body .
Setting to or sets all rows to have that striping color .
Overridden by the oddstyle and evenstyle parameters -LRB- if specified -RRB- below .
Everything else is exactly the same as .
; evenodd : If set to , then the automatic striping of even and odd rows is reversed .
; listn : -LRB- i.e. list1 , list2 , ... list20 -RRB- The body of the template , usually a list of links .
Each listn may be preceded by a corresponding groupn parameter , if provided -LRB- see below -RRB- .
If multiple templates are used inside of a parent , it generally looks better if the width of the groups matches up .
If you also use the or parameters , then you will most likely also need to set their width manually using the and parameters .
; grouppadding : CSS style to specify group padding .
It is recommended to leave this parameter alone and use the default padding .
This option overrides any styles that are applied to the entire table .
NOTE : Due to system limitations , do not use a semi-colon to close this command .
This template is designed to be used with or other navigational templates that allow creating lists of links with groups headers or titles .
; groupn : -LRB- i.e. group1 , group2 , ... , group20 -RRB- If specified , text appears in a header cell displayed to the left of listn .
For example , place the following code in each to adjust the widths :
This example implements horizontal group headings by assigning the headings to and and the links to and -RRB- , then using and to set the background color of the headings .
In order to do this , one must set the parameters to contain the desired width , and the parameters to have width : auto -LRB- due to HTML \ / CSS reasons -RRB- .

Arnold had an Indian messenger sent into the camp of British Brigadier General Barry St. Leger with news that the approaching force was much larger and closer than it actually was ; this convinced St. Leger &apos; s Indian support to abandon him , forcing him to give up the effort .
In the winter of 1782 , Arnold moved to London with his second wife , Margaret `` Peggy &apos; &apos; Shippen Arnold .
He then distinguished himself in both Battles of Saratoga , even though General Gates , following a series of escalating disagreements and disputes that culminated in a shouting match , removed him from field command after the first battle .
Fictional invocations of Arnold &apos; s name also carried strongly negative overtones .
His doctors diagnosed him as having dropsy , and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition .
In the Battle of Ridgefield , he led a small contingent of militia attempting to stop or slow the British return to the coast , and was again wounded in his left leg .
In London he aligned himself with the Tories , advising Germain and King George III to renew the fight against the Americans .
This suggestion Clinton refused ; after a military tribunal , AndrÃ was hanged at Tappan , New York on 2 October .
AndrÃ then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold .
Benedict was born the second of six children to Benedict Arnold III -LRB- 1683 â `` 1761 -RRB- and Hannah Waterman King in Norwich , Connecticut , on January 14 , 1741 .
Novelistic treatments of the American Revolutionary war sometimes feature Arnold as a character .
Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant delivering AndrÃ into Arnold &apos; s custody , but then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of AndrÃ &apos; s arrest .
-LRB- Arnold did not know that this proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources . -RRB-
On 16 June Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business , and sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel .
At first Arnold took no part in any public demonstrations but , like many merchants , continued to trade as if the Stamp Act did not exist . This meant he was a smuggler in defiance of the act .
However , the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes , since his father took up drinking .
He helped organize militia forces on British-held islands , receiving praise from the landowners for his efforts on their behalf .
Arnold told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety of his idea to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York , which he knew was poorly defended .
Arnold learned of AndrÃ &apos; s capture the following morning , 24 September , when he received Jameson &apos; s message that AndrÃ was in his custody and that the papers AndrÃ was carrying had been sent to General Washington .
After the start of fighting at Lexington and Concord the following month , his company marched northeast to help at the siege of Boston that followed .
On the grounds of the United States Military Academy at West Point there are plaques commemorating all of the generals that served in the Revolution .
Rather than amputating his shattered left leg , he had it crudely set , leaving it 2 i shorter than the right .
On 30 August 30 , Arnold sent a letter accepting Clinton &apos; s terms and proposing a meeting to AndrÃ through yet another intermediary : William Heron , a member of the Connecticut Assembly he thought he could trust .
The boy is not identified until the end of the story , when his place of birth is given as Norwich , Connecticut , and his name is given as Benedict Arnold .
On 9 May Franklin introduced Stansbury to Major AndrÃ , who had just been named the British spy chief .
Social historian Brian Carso notes that as the 19th century progressed , the story of Arnold &apos; s betrayal took on near-mythic proportions as a part of the national creation story , and was again invoked as sectional conflicts leading up the American Civil War increased .
Legend has it that when he was on his deathbed he said , `` Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles .
Harper &apos; s Weekly published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as `` a few men directing this colossal treason , by whose side Benedict Arnold shines white as a saint . &apos; &apos;
Arnold worked over the next few months to publicize this fact ; however , in early April , just one week after Washington congratulated Arnold on the 19 May birth of his son , Edward Shippen Arnold , Washington published a formal rebuke of Arnold &apos; s behavior .
He wrote he was `` very much shocked &apos; &apos; and wondered `` good God , are the Americans all asleep and tamely giving up their liberties , or are they all turned philosophers , that they do n &apos;t take immediate vengeance on such miscreants &apos; &apos; .
In 1785 Arnold and his son Richard moved to Saint John , New Brunswick , where they speculated in land , and established a business doing trade with the West Indies .
But one notable treatment , depicting Arnold very much in a positive light , is Kenneth Roberts &apos; Arundel novels , which cover many of the campaigns in which he participated :
At the same time , he tried to drain West Point &apos; s supplies , so that a siege would be more likely to succeed .
Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there .
Heron , in a comic twist , went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter , and offered his own services to the British as a spy .
At first , he asked for indemnification of his losses and Â # 10,000 , an amount the Continental Congress had given Charles Lee for his services in the Continental Army .
Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges , writing to Washington in May 1779 , `` Having become a cripple in the service of my country , I little expected to meet -LRB- such -RRB- ungrateful returns &apos; &apos; .
One colonel wrote to Clinton of Arnold , `` there are many officers who must wish some other general in command &apos; &apos; .
When presented with evidence of Arnold &apos; s betrayal , it is reported that Washington was calm .
He had established decent relationships with George Washington , commander of the army , as well as Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates , both of whom had command of the army &apos; s Northern Department during 1775 and 1776 .
Through his maternal grandmother , Arnold was a descendant of John Lothropp , an ancestor of at least four U.S. presidents .
In February 1777 , he learned that he had been passed over for promotion to major general by Congress .
Once he established himself at West Point , Arnold began systematically weakening its defences and military strength .
His conflicting legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor .
Arnold also faced financial ruin . He owed Â # 16,000 and some creditors spread rumors that he was bankrupt .
Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia , and was a prominent figure on the social scene .
With the outbreak of the French Revolution Arnold outfitted a privateer , while continuing to do business in the West Indies , even though the hostilities increased the risk .
Meanwhile , AndrÃ convinced the unsuspecting commanding officer to whom he was delivered , Colonel John Jameson , to send him back to Arnold at West Point .
While this is the case , no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company . &apos; &apos;
When he was ten , Arnold was sent to a private school in nearby Canterbury , and was expected to go to Yale .
From the ship Arnold wrote a letter to Washington , requesting that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia , a request Washington granted .
General Washington sent Arnold to the defend Rhode Island after the British seized Newport in December 1776 , where the militia was too poorly equipped to even consider an attack on the British .
Their first son , Benedict VI , was born the following year , and was followed by brothers Richard in 1769 , and Henry in 1772 .
Benedict Arnold V -LRB- â `` 14 June 1801 -RRB- was a general during the American Revolutionary War .
Arnold then went to Cambridge , Massachusetts , and suggested to George Washington a second expedition to attack Quebec City via a wilderness route through present-day Maine .
He also peppered Washington with complaints about the lack of supplies , writing , `` Everything is wanting &apos; &apos; .
The court martial to consider the charges against Arnold began meeting on 1 June 1779 , but was delayed until December 1779 by General Clinton &apos; s capture of Stony Point , New York , throwing the army into a flurry of activity to react .
Upon learning of AndrÃ &apos; s capture , Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British ship HMS Vulture . He was almost captured by the forces of George Washington , who had been alerted to the plot .
He was named after his great-grandfather Benedict Arnold , an early governor of the Colony of Rhode Island , and his brother Benedict IV , who died in infancy .
In the letter to Washington requesting safe passage for Peggy , he wrote that `` Love to my country actuates my present conduct , however it may appear inconsistent to the world , who very seldom judge right of any man &apos; s actions . &apos; &apos;
Born in Connecticut , Arnold was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775 .
However , Arnold interpreted the manner in which they did so as an act of sympathy for his wounds , and not an apology or recognition that they were righting a wrong .
In January 1801 Arnold &apos; s health began to decline .
In 1787 , he entered into mercantile business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John , New Brunswick , but returned to London to settle permanently in 1791 , where he died ten years later .
Following the most serious , a slander suit he won against a former business partner , townspeople burned him in effigy in front of his house as Peggy and the children watched .
The connection between Arnold and treason continued into the 20th and 21st centuries .
Burgoyne surrendered ten days after the second battle , on 17 October 1777 .
Washington refused his offer to resign , and wrote to members of Congress in an attempt to correct this , noting that `` two or three other very good officers &apos; &apos; might be lost if they persisted in making politically-motivated promotions .
On an episode of The Brady Bunch , Everyone Ca n &apos;t Be George Washington , after Peter is assigned the role of Arnold in the school play , everyone hates him .
By early July he was back in Philadelphia , where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on 7 July which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a `` drawing of the works ... by which you might take -LRB- West Point -RRB- without loss &apos; &apos; .
During the fighting in the second battle , Arnold , against Gates &apos; orders , took to the battlefield and led attacks on the British defences .

The captain was wounded after the first exchange of gunfire , and apologized after Arnold threatened to aim to kill on the second .
One particularly harsh critic said that he was a `` mean mercenary , who , having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder , quits it when convicted of that charge . &apos; &apos;
In response to Arnold &apos; s valor at Saratoga , Congress restored his command seniority .

On 13 August Schuyler dispatched him with a force of 900 to relieve the siege of Fort Stanwix , where he used a trick to end the siege .
He was well received by King George III and the Tories but frowned upon by the Whigs .
Shortly after Washington &apos; s rebuke , a Congressional inquiry into his expenditures concluded that Arnold had failed to fully account for his expenditures incurred during the Quebec invasion , and that he owed the Congress some Â # 1,000 , largely because he was unable to document them .
Arnold was buried at St. Mary &apos; s Church , Battersea in London , England .

Arnold then returned to the Hudson , where General Gates had taken over command of the American army , which had by then retreated to a camp south of Stillwater .
On 22 February 1767 , he married Margaret Mansfield , daughter of Samuel Mansfield , the sheriff of New Haven , an acquaintance that may have been made through the membership of both Mansfield and Arnold in the local Masonic Lodge .

Clinton , concerned that Washington &apos; s army and the French fleet would join in Rhode Island , again fixed on West Point as a strategic point to capture .
On 4 September not long after the birth of his and Peggy &apos; s second son , Arnold &apos; s force of over 1,700 men raided and burned New London and captured Fort Griswold , causing damage estimated at $ 500,000 .
He was again severely wounded in the left leg late in the fighting .
He then directed the construction of a fleet to defend Lake Champlain , which was defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island .
The first major biography of Arnold , The Life and Treason of Benedict Arnold , published in 1832 by historian Jared Sparks , was particularly harsh in showing how Arnold &apos; s treacherous character was allegedly formed out of childhood experiences .
He led British forces on raids in Virginia , and against New London and Groton , Connecticut , before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown .
After the plot was exposed in September 1780 , he was made a brigadier general in the British Army .
While en route to West Point , Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith , someone Arnold knew had done spy work for both sides , and who owned a house near the western bank of the Hudson just south of West Point .
As a result of a clerical error in the parish records , his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later .

Due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines , neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement to that offer .
Arnold was on his way to Philadelphia to discuss his future when he was alerted that a British force was marching toward a supply depot in Danbury , Connecticut .

When he reached Connecticut Arnold arranged to sell his home there , and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York .
Arnold , who was promoted to brigadier general for his role in reaching Quebec , maintained an ineffectual siege of the city until he was replaced by Major General David Wooster in April 1776 .
During these actions , Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress .
On the night of 28 January 1767 , Arnold and members of his crew , watched by a crowd of Sons , roughed up a man suspected of attempting to inform authorities of Arnold &apos; s smuggling .

Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin , the last Colonial Governor of New Jersey and the son of Benjamin Franklin .
AndrÃ spoke to General Clinton , who gave him broad authority to pursue Arnold &apos; s offer .

Needed repairs on the chain across the Hudson were never ordered .
Only action by Gates , then his superior at Ticonderoga , prevented his own arrest on countercharges levelled by Hazen .

These further reactions use the pyruvate from glycolysis .
Since glucose leads to two triose sugars in the preparatory phase , each reaction in the pay-off phase occurs twice per glucose molecule .
It occurs , with variations , in nearly all organisms , both aerobic and anaerobic .
This yields 2 NADH molecules and 4 ATP molecules , leading to a net gain of 2 NADH molecules and 2 ATP molecules from the glycolytic pathway per glucose molecule .
Glycolysis is thought to be the archetype of a universal metabolic pathway .
The wide occurrence of glycolysis shows that it is one of the most ancient known metabolic pathways .
The second half of glycolysis is known as the ` pay-off phase &apos; , by the net gain of the energy-rich molecules ATP and NADH .
Cells performing aerobic respiration -LRB- respiration using oxygen -RRB- synthesize much more ATP , but not as part of glycolysis .
Eukaryote aerobic respiration produces about 34 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule .

They are extinct now , but once they had made the Southern Hound more popular , which helped the Southern Hound descend to the Beagle .
Snoopy of the comic strip Peanuts has been picked as `` the world &apos; s most famous beagle &apos; &apos; .
Beagles are mostly developed for hunting and finding hare , rabbit , and other kinds of game .
Beagles have been included in popular culture since the times when Queen Elizabeth began to rule , in literature and paintings , and more recently in film , television and comic books .
Dogs that look almost the same as the modern Beagle can be traced in Ancient Greece back to around the 5th century BC .
It was named so because it could fit in a `` pocket &apos; &apos; or saddlebag , when they rode along on the hunt .
Elizabeth I called the dogs her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups .
They are also popular as pets because of their good size , sweet temper , and health .
From medieval times , beagle was used as a general description for small hounds , even though they are actually very different from the modern breed .
The Beagle is a breed of small to medium-sized dog .
In the 11th century , William the Conqueror brought the Talbot hound to Britain .
Although beagle-type dogs have existed for over 2,000 years , the modern kind came from Great Britain around the 1830s .
Once , English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to make them faster in running .
In the Treatise on Hunting or Cynegeticus , written by Xenophon , who said there was a hound that hunted hares by scent and was followed by foot .
Edward and Henry both had packs of Glove Beagles , who were named because of their small size . Also , Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle , which stood 8 t at the shoulder .
In George Jesse &apos; s Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866 , Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the Beagle as small enough to sit on a man &apos; s hand and to the :
The Talbot was a white , slow hound .
If these laws were true , it would be enough proof that beagle-type dogs lived in England before 1016 , but it is likely that the laws were written in the Middle Ages for tradition .

Carolingian minuscule was the direct and linear ancestor of blackletter .
Flavio Biondo , in Italia Illustrata -LRB- 1531 -RRB- thought it was invented by the Lombards after their invasion of Italy in the sixth century .
Lieftinck also divided cursiva into three styles : littera cursiva formata was the most legible and calligraphic style .
As early as the eleventh century , different forms of Carolingian were already being used , and by the mid-twelfth century , a clearly distinguishable form , able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new books , was being used in north-eastern France and the Low Countries .
Blackletter came from Carolingian when Europe in the twelfth century needed new books in many different subjects when more and more people learned to read .
Textualis was most widely used in France , the Low Countries , England , and Germany .
The letters a , g , and s -LRB- at the end of a word -RRB- are very similar to their Carolingian forms .
Some characteristics of the script are :
Littera cursiva currens was used for textbooks and other unimportant books and it had very little standardization in forms .
Characteristics of the Fraktur are :
Not only were blackletter forms called Gothic script , but any other seemingly barbarian script , such as Visigothic , Beneventan , and Merovingian , were also labeled `` Gothic &apos; &apos; , in contrast to Carolingian minuscule , a highly legible script which the Humanists called littera antiqua , `` the ancient letter &apos; &apos; , wrongly believing that it was the script used by the Romans .
It is a mixture of textualis and cursiva , developed in the early fifteenth century .
These books needed to be produced quickly to keep up with demand .
Hybrida is also called bastarda -LRB- especially in France -RRB- , and as its name suggests , refers to a hybrid form of the script .
Cursiva refers to a very large variety of forms of blackletter ; as with modern cursive writing , there is no real standard form .
Littera cursiva textualis -LRB- or libraria -RRB- was the usual form , used for writing standard books , and it generally was written with a larger pen , leading to larger letters .
It developed in the fourteenth century as a simplified form of textualis , with influence from the form of textualis as used for writing charters .
Carolingian , though legible , was time-consuming and labour-intensive to produce .
It was invented in the reign of Charlemagne , although only used significantly after that era .
The blackletter must not be confused either with the ancient alphabet of the Gothic language or with the sans-serif typefaces that are also sometimes called Gothic .
Its use was so common that often any blackletter form is called Fraktur in Germany .
For Lieftinck , the highest form of textualis was littera textualis formata , used for de luxe manuscripts .
It continued to be used occasionally until the 20th century .
It was therefore , easier to write quickly on paper in a cursive script .
The Schwabacher was a blackletter form that was much used in early German print typefaces .
The term Gothic was first used to describe this script in fifteenth century Italy , in the midst of the Renaissance , because Renaissance Humanists believed it was a barbaric script .
In cursiva , descenders are more frequent , especially in the letters f and s , and ascenders are curved and looped rather than vertical -LRB- seen especially in the letter d -RRB- .
Cursiva developed partly because of the introduction of paper , which was smoother than parchment .
From textualis , it borrowed vertical ascenders , while from cursiva , it borrowed long f and Å , single-looped a , and g with an open descender -LRB- similar to Carolingian forms -RRB- .
According to Dutch scholar Gerard Lieftinck , the pinnacle of use for blackletter was the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries .
Textualis , also known as textura or Gothic bookhand , was the most calligraphic form of blackletter , and today is the form most associated with `` Gothic &apos; &apos; .
The Fraktur is a form of blackletter that became the most common German blackletter typeface by the mid 16th century .
Johannes Gutenberg carved a textualis typeface â `` including a large number of ligatures and common abbreviations â `` when he printed his 42-line Bible .
Lieftinck &apos; s third form , littera textualis currens , was the cursive form of blackletter , extremely difficult to read and used for textual glosses , and less important books .
Characteristics of the Schwabacher are :
Gothic was a synonym for barbaric .
It was large and wide and took up a lot of space on a manuscript in a time when writing materials were very costly .
New universities were founded , each writing books for business , law , grammar , history , and other topics , not only religious books , where earlier scripts were used .
However , not all of these features are found in every example of cursiva , which makes it difficult to determine whether or not a script may be called cursiva at all .
However , the textualis was rarely used for typefaces afterwards .
The usual form , simply littera textualis , was used for literary works and university texts .

The VLIW approach , on the other hand , executes operation in parallel based on a fixed schedule determined when programs are compiled .
All above ILP techniques are implemented at a higher cost with increased hardware complexity .
A processor that executes every instruction one after the other -LRB- i.e. a non-pipelined scalar architecture -RRB- may use processor resources inefficiently , leading to poor performance .
As a result , VLIW CPUs offer significant computational power with less hardware complexity but with greater compiler design complexity .
Before executing any operations in-parallel , the processor must verify that the instructions do not have interdependencies .
Since determining the order of execution of operations -LRB- including which operations can execute simultaneously -RRB- is handled by the compiler , the processor does not need the complex hardware required by ILP techniques described above .
There are many types of interdependencies , but a simple example would be a program in which the first instruction &apos; s result is used as an input for the second instruction .
-LRB- Alternatively , Variable Length Instruction Word or VLIW a refers to a CPU instruction -LRB- instruction set -RRB- designed to load -LRB- or copy -RRB- a literal value count of inline Machine code to the on-chip RAM for higher speed CPU decoding . -RRB-
They clearly can not execute at the same time , and the second instruction can not be executed before the first .

-LRB- Louis XIV -RRB- -RRB- organised his marriage to Anne Marie d &apos;Orl Ã ans in order to maintain French influence in the Duchy but Victor Amadeus soon broke away from the influence of France . Anne Marie was a devoted wife but Victor Amadeus did not love her .
At the death of the Prince of Piedmont in 1715 from smallpox Victor Amadeus II was very upset . His devoted wife Anne Marie died in 1728 after a series of heart attacks .
Three of these children would go on to have further progeny including the eldest Maria Adelaide who was the mother of Louis XV of France .
His second daughter Maria Luisa known in the family as Louison would marry Philip V of Spain in 1701 and was also regent of Spain for various periods .
Having fought in the War of the Spanish Succession , he became king of Sicily in 1713 but he was forced to exchange this title and instead became king of Sardinia to which his direct descendants claim as part of the Kingdom of Italy .
His favorite child was Victor Amadeus born in 1699 and given the title Prince of Piedmont as heir apparent .
Victor Amadeus subsequently had his daughter including the future Maria Vittoria marry the Prince of Carignan from which the present Vittorio Emanuele , Prince of Naples is a direct descendant .
Anne Marie would remain a devoted wife .
These two marriages were tactics used by Louis XIV to keep Victor Amadeus close to France prior to the War of the Spanish Succession .
She quietly accepted his extramarital affairs the longest one being with the famed beauty Jeanne Baptiste d &apos;Albert de Luynes by whom he had two children .
-LRB- Louis XIV -RRB- -RRB- organised his marriage to Anne Marie d &apos;Orl Ã ans in order to maintain French influence in the Duchy but Victor Amadeus soon broke away from the influence of France .
Jeanne Baptiste was his mistress for eleven years and eventually fled Savoy due to Victor Amadeus &apos; obsession with her .
Anne Marie gave her husband six children but also had two stillbirths of each gender one in 1691 and again in 1697 .
Victor Amadeus left a considerable cultural influence in Turin remodelling the Royal Palace of Turin , Palace of Venaria , Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi as well as building the Basilica of Superga where he rests .
His distant relationship with his mother was always strained and has been blamed on her ambition to keep power to herself .
His relationship with his younger son and eventual successor Charles Emmanuel was a cold one and the two were never close .
At his fathers death in 1675 , his mother took over a regency in the name of her nine year old son and would remain in de facto power till 1684 when Victor Amadeus banished her further involvement in the state .
The second marriage was to Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg a first cousin of Anne Christine and mother of six children including the future Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia .

The Viking Age was a period in Northern European and Scandinavian history from the eighth to eleventh centuries .
At the start of the Viking age , the Vikings adhered to the Norse religion and system of beliefs .
The lower class of society would go to a place called `` hel &apos; &apos; , similar to life on earth .
Some scholarly works on the Viking Age became available to readers in Britain .
It was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that the Northmen raided the important island monastery of Lindisfarne : `` AD .
The introduction of Christianity did not immediately end Viking voyages , but it may have been a factor that helped the Viking Age to an end .
Several generations later , the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers identified themselves as French and brought the French language and their variant of French culture to England in 1066 .
The end of the Viking Age in Norway is marked by the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030 .

- Anglo Saxon Chronicle
The beginning of the Viking Age in the British Isles is , however , often given as 793 .
Until recently , what was known about the history of the Viking Age was based on the Icelandic Sagas , the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus , the Russian Primary Chronicle and the War of the Irish with the Foreigners .
During the second half of the 18th century the Icelandic Sagas were still used as important historical sources , but the Viking Age was regarded as a barbaric and uncivilized period in the history of the Nordic countries .
In England the Viking Age began dramatically on June 8 , 793 , when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne .
They proclaimed Norway as a Christian nation , and Norwegians could no longer be called Vikings .
The earliest date given for a Viking raid is 787 CE when , according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , a group of men from Norway sailed to Portland , in Dorset .
Instead , the Viking age is said to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the adoption of Christianity as the dominant religion .
Historians also suggest that the Scandinavian population was too large for the peninsula and there were not enough crops to feed everyone .
Monks were killed in the abbey , thrown into the sea to drown , or carried away as slaves along with the church &apos; s wealth .
The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to study some of the Icelandic Sagas .
In 911 , French King Charles the Simple made an agreement with the Viking warleader Rollo , a chieftain of either Norwegian or Danish origin .
The first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century .
Internal conflicts , especially during the period of conquest and settlement that followed the early raids , caused the progressive centralisation of power into fewer hands .
Those who settled Iceland created Europe &apos; s first modern republic with a yearly assembly of elected officials called the Althing .
According to Viking beliefs , Viking chieftains would please their war-gods by their bravery , and would become `` worth-ship &apos; &apos; ; that is , the chieftain would earn a `` burial at sea &apos; &apos; .
More than any other single event , the attack on Lindisfarne cast a shadow on the perception of the Vikings for the next 1100 years .
`` Never before has such an atrocity been seen , &apos; &apos; declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York .
These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine : and not long after , on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year , the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island -LRB- Lindisfarne -RRB- , by rapine and slaughter . &apos; &apos;
Some farmers even called their fields after Freyr , in the hope that this would ensure a good harvest .
Freyr and his sister Freya were fertility gods .
From bases there , the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802 , causing great slaughter amongst the CÃ li DÃ Brethren , and burning the abbey to the ground .
There , a royal official mistook them for merchants .
This led to a hunt for more land to feed the ever-growing Viking population .
They believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses , as well as Valhalla , a heaven for warriors .
Some of the most important trading ports during the period include both existing and ancient cities such as Jelling -LRB- Denmark -RRB- , Ribe -LRB- Denmark -RRB- , Roskilde -LRB- Denmark -RRB- , Hedeby -LRB- Denmark , now Germany -RRB- , Aarhus -LRB- Denmark -RRB- , Vineta -LRB- Pomerania -RRB- , Truso -LRB- Poland -RRB- , Kaupang -LRB- Norway -RRB- , Birka -LRB- Sweden -RRB- , Bordeaux -LRB- France -RRB- , Jorvik -LRB- England -RRB- , Dublin -LRB- Ireland -RRB- and Aldeigjuborg -LRB- Russia -RRB- .
This meant that lower classes who did not want to be oppressed by greedy kings went in search of their own lands .
Near the end of Charlemagne &apos; s reign and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons , a string of Viking raids began , leading to a Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as Normandy .
With the Norman Conquest , they became the ruling aristocracy of Anglo-Saxon England , leading to the change from Old English to Middle English language .
Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources ; historians nowadays rely more on archaeology and numismatics , which have helped people understand the period .
This year came dreadful fore-warnings over the land of the Northumbrians , terrifying the people most woefully : these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air , and whirlwinds , and fiery dragons flying across the firmament .
The end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by three major events : the failed invasion by Haraldr HarÃ rÃ Ã i , who was defeated by Saxon King Harold Godwinson in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge ; in Ireland , the capture of Dublin by Strongbow and his Hiberno-Norman forces in 1171 ; and in Scotland by the defeat of King HÃ kon HÃ konarson at the Battle of Largs in 1263 .
The Vikings also reached Iceland , Greenland , Newfoundland , and Anatolia .
Toward the end of the Viking Age , more and more Scandinavians were converted to Christianity , often by force .
The Kingdom of the Franks under Charlemagne was especially hard-hit by Viking raiders , who could sail down the Seine without much difficulty .
The Viking devastation of Northumbria &apos; s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe .
They also performed land burials which often still included a ship , treasure , weapons , tools , clothing and even slaves and women buried alive with the dead chieftain , for his journey to Valhalla and adventure in the after-life .
In 794 , according to the Annals of Ulster , there was a serious attack on Lindisfarne &apos; s mother-house of Iona , which was followed in 795 by raids on the northern coast of Ireland .
They killed him when he tried to lead them to the king &apos; s manor to pay a trading tax on their goods .
Poets composed sagas about the exploits of these chieftains , keeping their memories alive .
The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries .
Harold Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by William , Duke of Normandy , who was another descendant of Vikings . Normandy had been acquired by Normans -LRB- Norsemen -RRB- in 911 .

Note that any data fed to the smallimage , smallimageright and smalltext parameters is only used if `` small = yes &apos; &apos; .
They have special needs and thus have their own meta-templates .
That is the usual way we make meta-templates since wiki markup has several drawbacks .
This template uses the tmbox CSS classes in MediaWiki : Common .
If the imageright parameter also is empty then no image is shown on the right side .
-LRB- But the message box can handle images of any size . -RRB-
If the image parameter also is empty then a small default image is used .
And now a pipe and end braces -RCB- -RCB- .
image No parameter = If no image parameter is given the template uses a default image .
For more technical details see the talk page .
smallimageright No parameter = If no smallimageright parameter is given then this template falls back to use the imageright parameter .
This template works similarly to and uses the same parameters .
An image = Should be an image with usual wiki notation .
small yes = Makes it a smaller right floating message box .
This template should normally not be used for WikiProject banners .
The following examples use different type parameters but use no image parameters thus they use the default images for each type .
Anything = Any other object that you want to show on the right side .
That means it gets a gray border .
When deciding on the type to use for a talkpage messagebox , please consider the following guidelines :
After discussions on the talk page of this template and announcing it at several places for some time we are now deploying this template .
Internally this meta-template uses HTML markup instead of wiki markup for the table code .
When this template is used to build talk page message boxes those boxes should contain explanatory texts just like before .
If you find any tricky cases then list them on the talk page of this template and you &apos; ll get help .
If there are more specific images in the boxes or you know a better image , then use them instead of the default images shown here .
text The message body text .
Since this template works almost exactly like , , and their talk pages and related pages might also contain more details .
This overrides any image fed to image , when `` small = yes &apos; &apos; .
For instance it makes it harder to use parser functions and special characters in parameters .
See the `` See also &apos; &apos; section below for links .
smallimage No parameter = If no smallimage parameter is given then this template falls back to use the image parameter .
imageright No parameter = If no imageright parameter is given then no image is shown on the right side .
Feel free to convert any message boxes used on talk pages to use this meta-template .
style Optional CSS values used by the entire message box table .
type If no type parameter is given the template defaults to type notice .
30px width is usually about right .
If no smalltext parameter is given then this template falls back to use the text parameter .
none = Means that no image is used .
none = Means that no right side image is used .
This template calls which holds most of the code for , while itself does parameter preprocessing .
Without quotation marks but with the ending semicolons .
-LRB- The same texts as before or new improved texts . -RRB-
This overrides any image fed to imageright , when `` small = yes &apos; &apos; .
The types of talkpage messageboxes follow the same naming convention as the boxes for all other namespaces , but the type of any particular talkpage messagebox may not be as obvious as in other namespaces .
textstyle Optional CSS values used by the text cell .
This also makes the default images smaller .
To make it so your template also understands the small parameter you can use this code : :
Some other parameter combinations .
40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio .
smalltext A shorter version of the message body text .
css for most of its looks , thus it is fully skinnable .
Which default image it uses depends on the type parameter .

East Berlin was officially called Berlin , Hauptstadt der DDR -LRB- `` Berlin , Capital of the GDR &apos; &apos; -RRB- , or simply `` Berlin , &apos; &apos; by East Germany .
East Germany closed the borders between East and West Germany in 1952 , but did not seal off West Berlin ; because there was freedom of movement between West Berlin and West Germany , Easterners could use the city as a crossing point to the West .
The Western Allies never recognized this claim . They said that the whole city was still under four-power occupation .
To stop this drain that the East German government built the Berlin Wall , thus physically closing off West Berlin from East Germany , on 13 August 1961 .
By the end of 1949 , two new states had been created out of occupied Germany - the Federal Republic of Germany -LRB- West Germany -RRB- in the West and the German Democratic Republic -LRB- East Germany -RRB- in the East - with West Berlin an enclave that was not part of either .
On 3 October 1990 West Berlin and East Berlin were united as the city of Berlin , which then joined the Federal Republic as a state , along with the rest of East Germany .
When the cold war began , the joint administration of Germany and Berlin broke down .
This is why the Grundgesetz -LRB- constitution of the Federal Republic -RRB- never applied in West Berlin .
The east German spelling suggested that West Berlin was not really part of `` Berlin &apos; &apos; as a whole , but a separate place . East Berlin was officially called Berlin , Hauptstadt der DDR -LRB- `` Berlin , Capital of the GDR &apos; &apos; -RRB- , or simply `` Berlin , &apos; &apos; by East Germany .
West Berlin and East Berlin thus both formally ceased to exist .
It was the American , British , and French occupied sectors that were created in 1945 .
The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 sealed the border between East Berlin and West Berlin .
The Soviet sector became East Berlin , which East Germany claimed as its capital .
In 1948 , the Soviets tried to force the western allies out Berlin by a blockade of the western sectors .
But the occupation of Berlin could only be ended by a quadripartite -LRB- four power -RRB- agreement , so Berlin remained an occupied territory under the formal control of all the allies .
The so-called Two Plus Four Treaty , signed by the two German states and the four wartime allies , paved the way for German reunification and an end to the western occupation of West Berlin .
However , in many ways , West Berlin functioned as the de facto 11th state of West Germany .
This move was not recognized by the western allies who continued to view all of Berlin as a jointly occupied territory belonging to neither of the two states .
On 9 November 1989 the wall was opened , and the two cities were once again physically - but not legally - united .
In many ways Berlin worked as a single city . The U-Bahn and S-Bahn public transit networks , rebuilt after the war , spanned all occupation sectors .
The Soviets declared the occupation of East Berlin ended when East Germany was set up .
As the Cold War continued , many East Germans began leaving East Germany for the West . East Germany closed the borders between East and West Germany in 1952 , but did not seal off West Berlin ; because there was freedom of movement between West Berlin and West Germany , Easterners could use the city as a crossing point to the West .
Soon Soviet-occupied Berlin and western-occupied Berlin different separate governments .
West Berlin was called `` Berlin -LRB- West -RRB- &apos; &apos; by the West Germany government , and usually by the East German government .
West Berlin was called `` Berlin -LRB- West -RRB- &apos; &apos; by the West Germany government , and usually by the East German government . The east German spelling suggested that West Berlin was not really part of `` Berlin &apos; &apos; as a whole , but a separate place .
Many people lived in one half of the city and had family members , friends , and jobs in the other .
West Berlin was the name of the western part of Berlin between 1949 and 1990 .
According to the western allies , the occupation of most of Germany ended in 1949 when the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were set up .
The Four Power Agreement on Berlin -LRB- September 1971 -RRB- and the Transit Agreement -LRB- May 1972 -RRB- , helped to ease the tensions over West Berlin and made it a little easier for West Berliners to travel to East Germany and for Germans traveling along the road routes into the city instead of flying .

The jingle went : `` Good morning , good morning , The best to you each morning , Sunshine Breakfast , Kellogg &apos; s Corn Flakes , Crisp and full of fun &apos; &apos; .
In the mono version , the length is 2 : 35 , whereas in the stereo version , the length is 2 : 41 because there are more animal noises .
Lennon asked engineer Geoff Emerick to arrange the animal noises heard at beginning as well as the end of the song so that the animal heard was one capable of devouring or frightening the animal that came before it . .
Inspiration for the song came to Lennon from a television commercial for Kellogg &apos; s Corn Flakes .

Vitamin C is produced from glucose by two main routes .
In animals , these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries .
The Reichstein process developed in the 1930s uses a single pre-fermentation followed by a purely chemical route .
In 1933 \ / 1934 , the British chemists Sir Walter Norman Haworth and Sir Edmund Hirst , and separately the Polish Tadeus Reichstein , successfully synthesized the vitamin . It was the first man-made vitamin .
Both processes yield approximately 60 % vitamin C from the glucose feed .
The more modern Two-Step fermentation process was originally developed in China in the 1960s , uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages .
The amount of vitamin C in foods of plant origin depends on the kind of plant , the kind of soil where it grew , how much rain and sun it got , the length of time since it was picked , and how it was stored since then .
It is also a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions , including several collagen synthesis reactions that cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy when they are dysfunctional .

Between the end of October 1930 , and Thanksgiving of that year , Sinclair had gotten an extension of Eisenstein &apos; s leave from the Soviet Union .
When it did , limited resources â &apos; &apos; both monetary and equipment â &apos; &apos; required production controls as big as in the capitalist world .

After a long time away from the Soviet Union , Stalin sent a telegram saying he was worried that Eisenstein had become a deserter .

People in the outside world praised the films . However , in the Soviet Union , Eisenstein &apos; s focus on structural issues such as camera angles , crowd movements and montage , was not liked by the much of the Soviet film community .
The schedule for making the movie would be `` a period of from three to four months , &apos; &apos; . The contract also said that `` Eisenstein ... agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico , all negative film and positive prints , and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture , will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair ... &apos; &apos; An addition to the contract , dated December 1 , allowed that the `` Soviet Government may have the -LRB- finished -RRB- film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R. &apos; &apos; Reportedly , it was verbally decided that the film was expected to be an hour long .

In the first year the plant grows leaves , stems , and roots -LRB- vegetative structures -RRB- ; then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months .
True biennials flower only once , while many perennials will flower every year once mature .
From a gardener &apos; s perspective , a plant &apos; s status as annual , biennial , or perennial often varies based on location or purpose .
Under extreme climatic conditions , a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time -LRB- e.g. 3 or 4 months instead of 2 years -RRB- .
Many biennials require a cold treatment , before they will flower .
Biennials grown for flowers , fruits , or seeds need to be grown for two years .
Examples of biennial plants are parsley , Lunaria , silverbeet , sweet William , colic weed , and carrot .
Flowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone gibberellin , but this is rarely done commercially .
The plant then flowers , produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies .
This behavior leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas .
Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals , e.g. beets , Brussels sprouts , cabbage , carrots , celery , parsley , and Swiss chard .
If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions , it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold .
This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions , before they were planted in the ground .
Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial .
Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed , e.g. foxglove , stock , and hollyhock .
A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle .
Conversely , an annual grown under extremely favourable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation , giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial .
Usually , the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground , forming a rosette .

Tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents , a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds .
In the mid-latitude westerlies , troughs and ridges often exchange with each other , especially when upper-level winds are in a high-amplitude pattern .
Some tropical or subtropical areas , such as the Philippines or south China are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough .
Convective cells may form in the surrounding area of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone .
For a trough in the westerlies , the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air - and hence high pressure - while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast , divergent winds and low pressure .
A trough is an elongated area of comparatively low atmospheric pressure , usually in association with weather fronts .

It is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing to get the final RNA product of a gene .
Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses , and can be located in a wide range of genes , including those that generate proteins , ribosomal RNA -LRB- rRNA -RRB- , and transfer RNA -LRB- tRNA -RRB- .
The term intron was introduced by American biochemist Walter Gilbert .
Alternative splicing of introns within a gene allows a variety of protein isoforms from a single gene . Thus multiple related proteins can be generated from a single gene and a single precursor mRNA transcript .
The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene , and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts .
RNA splicing takes place after transcription and before translation .
Sequences of coding DNA which are joined together in the final RNA after RNA splicing are exons .
The discovery of introns led to the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for Phillip Sharp and Richard Roberts .
The control of alternative RNA splicing is performed by complex network of signalling molecules .

Before the 4th century BC , Greek astronomers thought that Mercury was two different objects : one able to be seen only at sunrise , which they called Apollo ; the other that was only able to be seen at sunset , which they called Hermes .
The first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was Mariner 10 , which mapped only about 45 % of the planetâ s surface from 1974 to 1975 .

But , for StarÄ eviÄ , there was a race worst than the Jews . For him , the `` Slavoserb &apos; &apos; notion was firstly of a political nature : the `` Slavoserbs &apos; &apos; are his political opponents who `` sold themselves to a foreign rule &apos; &apos; .
StarÄ eviÄ immediately returned to Croatia and continued studying theology in Senj .
As an aged man , he makes the Serbs identical to the `` Slavoserb breed &apos; &apos; and mocks them for their defeats they suffered long ago - which provoked negative reactions even in his `` Party of Rights &apos; &apos; .
When Srbski dnevnik from Novi Sad published an article saying that `` Croatians write in Serbian &apos; &apos; , StarÄ eviÄ wrote a fierce reply : Instead of claiming that the Croats use anything else but the Croatian language , those writers who consider themselves Serbs -LRB- or whatever they like -RRB- would do well to write in the educated and pure Croatian language , like some of them are already doing , and they can call their language Coptic for all I care .
To let the Jews to participate in public life is dangerous : throw a piece of mud in a glass of the clearest water - then all the water will be puddled .
In the preface to this reprint edition , Dr. Vladimir Veselica , a Zagreb University professor , expresses his enthusiasm that the author had given `` relevant answers &apos; &apos; at the highest intellectual level .
On that occasion , the Party member Erazmo BarÄ iÄ -LRB- 1894 . -RRB- described StarÄ eviÄ &apos; s mockery and racism as `` throwing mud at people and primitive cheeky invectives &apos; &apos; .
In his old age , he moved to StarÄ eviÄ House -LRB- StarÄ eviÄ ev dom -RRB- , built for him by the Party of Rights in 1895 .
After passing a number of philosophy and free sciences classes , he earned a honoris causa degree in the year of 1846 .
His translation of Anacreon from Ancient Greek was published in Danica in 1853 .
StarÄ eviÄ was the only parliamentary representative who agreed with Kvaternik &apos; s draft constitution of 26 June , 1861 .
Rather than becoming a priest , however , he decided to engage in secular pursuits and started working in the law firm of Ladislav Å ram in Zagreb .
His understanding of the basic human rights and the way he linked them to the civil liberties were extremely primitive and selective .
He published the reply as an unsigned article in Narodne novine , the newspaper of Ljudevit Gaj , so the Serbian side attacked Gaj , wrongly attributing the article to him .
The Croatian Party of Rights was abolished .
Further , he claimed that the injustice was done to different `` cursed breeds &apos; &apos; what spoiled those breeds even more and made them `` to be vengeful against their oppressors &apos; &apos; .
He pointed out that Croatia needed to determine its relationships with Austria and Hungary through international agreements .
In the foreword , young StarÄ eviÄ elaborated his linguistic ideas , pointing out that the mixture of all three Croatian dialects -LRB- Shtokavian , Chakavian -RRB- and Kajkavian -RRB- and the Krajina dialect is called the Croatian language , which StarÄ eviÄ considers from the perspective of its six hundred years of history .
That way the Jews spoiled and poisoned the French people too much &apos; &apos; .
He wrote a whole tractate about the Jews that could be summarized in a few sencences : `` Jews ... are the breed , except a few , without any morality and without any homeland , the breed of which every unit strives to its personal gain , or to its relatives &apos; gain .
In his vain and racistic effors to oppose and derail KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ &apos; s work , he was loner and loser - mainstream of the Croatian educated men , headed by Strossmayer and Gaj , highly appreciated and supported KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ .
His portrait is depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 1000 Croatian kuna banknote , issued in 1993 .
According to his wish , he was buried in the Church of St Mirko in the Zagreb suburb of Å estine .
As a convinced racist , he stresses that to the `` cursed breeds &apos; &apos; , i.e. to the lower races should not be given any role in the public life .
His travelogue From Lika was published in KuÅ lan &apos; s magazine Slavenski Jug on 22 October 1848 .
However , when once facing with negative reactions to his open racism , he temporarily retreated .
He started his studies at the seminary in Senj , but moved to Pest in the year of 1845 in order to attend a Roman Catholic theological seminary - which he finished in 1848 .
His opposition to the Vuk &apos; s work he ` supported &apos; by utter denial of the Serbs as the nation , their language , their culture and history .
StarÄ eviÄ wrote literary criticism , short stories , newspaper articles , philosophical essays , plays and political satire .
Austria lost control over Italy , and Austria &apos; s weakening status in the world paved the way for StarÄ eviÄ &apos; s career .
While the revolt drew several hundred men , both Croats and Serbs , it was soon crushed by Imperial Austrian troops .
StarÄ eviÄ believed that Bosniaks were the `` the best Croats &apos; &apos; , and claimed that `` Bosnian Muslims are a part of the Croatian people and of the purest Croatian blood &apos; &apos; .
While in Paris , he published his work La Croatie et la confÃ dÃ ration italienne , considered by some to be the precursor to his Party of Rights &apos; political program .
He advocated the termination of the Military Frontier and persuaded parliament to pass on 5 August , 1861 the decision annulling any joint business with Austria .
In 1862 , when Fiume was the scene of protests against Austrian Empire , he was suspended and sentenced to one month in prison as an enemy of the regime .
StarÄ eviÄ subsequently proclaimed he was the author , but Gaj , who cared to maintain good relations with Serbia , distanced himself from his friend .
He was also a member of the committee of Matica ilirska , a Croatian cultural society , in the Historical Society and in the editorial board of Neven , a literary magazine .
Later , and with years , StarÄ eviÄ more and more marked the `` Slavoserbs &apos; &apos; as a separate ethnic group , or - as he used to say the `` breed &apos; &apos; , ranked , as humans , lower than the Jews : `` The Jews are less harmful than the Slavoserbs .
After being banned from practicing law in 1857 , StarÄ eviÄ traveled to Russia where he hoped he would gather support from the empire &apos; s eastern rival .
When he was released , StarÄ eviÄ returned to Å ram &apos; s office , where he remained until 11 October 1871 , when he was arrested again , this time on the occasion of the Rakovica Revolt .
That was a reason that he wrote an article in Sloboda , issue of 23 March , 1883 : The main thing is this : everybody should work for the people and the homeland , and let them call themselves as they wish ... We have disputes and dissensions only because they are supported and strengthened from the outside ... We believe that hungry and cold Serbs and Croats feel the same ... Therefore , everybody can assume the name of Hottentots , every person can choose their own name , as long as we are all free and happy !
StarÄ eviÄ was born in Å 1 \ / 2 itnik near GospiÄ , a small town of the Military Frontiers , in what was then part of Austria-Hungary .
On that ideological basis , he founded the Croatian Party of Rights with his school friend Eugen Kvaternik in 1861 .
In 1845 , he graduated from the comprehensive secondary school in Zagreb .
For his political activity and literary work , StarÄ eviÄ is commonly called Father of the Nation -LRB- Otac domovine -RRB- in Croatia .
In 1850 , incited by Ljudevit Gaj , StarÄ eviÄ started working on the manuscript of Istarski razvod , a crucial Croatian document from 1325 .
He demanded the reintegration of the Croatian lands , the large kingdom of Croatia of old -LRB- the Middle Age &apos; s Kingdom of Croatia -RRB- , the homeland of one people , with the same blood , language , past and -LRB- God willing -RRB- future .
It is sufficient to submit one quotation that explains the sense and content of this book , which far outdoes the current demonization of the Serbs : &apos; &apos; it was not without reason that I tried to show how the Serbs today are dangerous for their ideas and their racial composition , how a bent for conspiracies , revolutions and coups is in their blood . &apos; &apos;
He wrote four plays in the period 1851-52 , but only the Village Prophet has been preserved .
It was demonstrated publicly immediately after KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ &apos; s death - when Croatian Parliament -LRB- Sabor -RRB- collected a considerable amount of money in order to errect a monument to honor KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ in Croatia and the Court chanchellor Ivan MaÅ 3 \ / 4 uraniÄ got the Viennese Imperial Court to financially support the KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ &apos; widow .
In that period , in the Call for Subscriptions to the Croatian Grammar -LRB- 8 December , 1851 -RRB- he stated his opposition to the Vienna Language Agreement of 1850 and the linguistic concept of Vuk StefanoviÄ KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ .
He was the son of a Serb Orthodox mother and Catholic father .
The revolt was launched by Kvaternik , who was not a Serb hater as his political comrade StarÄ eviÄ . Kvaternik had become convinced that a political solution , as StarÄ eviÄ called for , was not possible .
About the people and nations which he saw as cursed and lower ranked races - he spoke as of the animal breeds and uses the `` breed &apos; &apos; word to mark them .
StarÄ eviÄ &apos; s racism was further fully elaborated by Ivo Pilar -LRB- under pseudonym L. von SÃ 1 \ / 4 dland -RRB- The book was translated into Croatian language in the year of 1943 , by PaveliÄ &apos; s regime , as one of the tenets of his UstaÅ e and his Independent State of Croatia . This racist work was reprinted in 1990 .
StarÄ eviÄ would be reelected to the parliament in 1865 , 1871 , and from 1878 to his death .
He transcribed the text from the Glagolitic alphabet to the Latin alphabet , analyzed it and published it in 1852 .
That same year , he was elected to the Croatian Parliament as the representative of Fiume and founded the Croatian Party of Rights with Eugen Kvaternik .
StarÄ eviÄ was released after two months in prison .
He continued his dispute with the followers of KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ in a series of articles published in 1852 .
Then all those who favorably look on the South Slavs unity not regarding them -LRB- the South Slavs -RRB- as the Croats .
StarÄ eviÄ accepted the etymological orthography and used the ekavian form for his entire life , considering it the heir of the old Kajkavian .
His language is a `` synthetic &apos; &apos; form of Croatian , never used before or after him , most similar to the Ozalj idiom of Petar Zrinski , whom he probably never read .
In 1859 , the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Second Italian War of Independence , during which time StarÄ eviÄ returned to Croatia .
His bust was made by Ivan RendiÄ .
Ante StarÄ eviÄ -LRB- 23 May , 1823 - 28 February , 1896 -RRB- was a Croatian politician and publisher .
He was also a translator .
StarÄ eviÄ was a racist and an anti-Semite .
As the chief notary in Fiume in 1861 , StarÄ eviÄ wrote `` the four petitions of the Rijeka county &apos; &apos; , which are considered the basis of the political program of the Croatian Party of Rights .
- he wrote once .
In 1861 , he was appointed the chief notary of the Fiume county .
At his deathbed , he requested that no monuments be raised to his honor , but his statue was put up in front of StarÄ eviÄ House in 1998 .
As Josip Horvat said : His literary work from 1849 to the end of 1853 made Ante StarÄ eviÄ the most prolific and original Croatian writer along with Mirko BogoviÄ .
For the Jews care for themselves and their people ... but the Slavoserbs are always for the evil : if they can not gain a benefit , then they tend to harm the good or just affair , or to harm those who are for the affair . &apos; &apos;
He advocated the resolution of Bosnian issues by reforms and cooperation between the people and the nobility .
His opus shows an affinity with practical philosophy , which he calls `` the science of life &apos; &apos; .
For example , StarÄ eviÄ criticized the socialism as `` unshaped &apos; &apos; and he was delighted by the colonialism and claimed that `` Algeria should be densely populated by a few million of happy Frenchmen and not to allow to have one hundred fifty thousand of them against two and half million of Arabs &apos; &apos; .
He then tried to get an academic post with the University of Zagreb . As he was unsuccessful , he remained in Å ram &apos; s office until 1861 although he was banned from practicing law in 1857 .
His critical review -LRB- 1855 -RRB- of Ä urÄ ` eviÄ &apos; s Pjesni razlike was described by the Croatian literary historian Branko Vodnik as `` our first genuine literary essay about older Dubrovnik literature &apos; &apos; .
StarÄ eviÄ had based his ideological views on writings of those ancient Greek writers who thought that some people , by their very nature , are slaves , for they had `` just half of the human mind &apos; &apos; and , for that reason , they `` shall be governed by people of the human nature &apos; &apos; .

The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object .
Accretion discs of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared , those around neutron stars and black holes in the X-ray part of the spectrum .
Instabilities within the disc redistribute angular momentum , causing material in the disc to spiral inward towards the central body .
An accretion disc -LRB- or accretion disk -RRB- is a structure formed by diffuse material in orbital motion around a central body .
The central body is typically either a young star , a protostar , a white dwarf , a neutron star , or a black hole .

The stadium is located on the east side of the Georgia Tech campus .
After the 2002 season , the expansion was completed by adding a free standing upper deck in the north end zone .
In 1985 the South stands were taken down to make room for the William C. Wardlaw Center .
By 1925 , the west and south stands were completed , making the stadium a 30,000-seat horseshoe with an open north end .
In the summer of 2009 , Bobby Dodd Stadium underwent a number of changes .
The stadium is the oldest continuously used on-campus site for college football in the southern United States .
Following the 2001 season , a major expansion and renovation project was started , which was done in two phases in order to play the 2002 season in the stadium .
In 1913 , grandstands were built for the first time , mostly by Tech students .
Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field is the football stadium at the corner of North Avenue at Techwood Drive on the campus of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , Georgia .
Grant Field was occasionally used as a site for Atlanta Falcons games during the team &apos; s early years when it was sharing Fulton County Stadium with the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball .
It is also the oldest stadium in Division I Football Bowl Subdivision .
It is in the middle of Atlanta , just off Interstate 75 \ / 85 , across from the Varsity restaurant .
It has been home to the Yellow Jackets football team since 1905 .
For the 2002 season , seating was returned to the South end in front of the Wardlaw Center , and the original North stands and lower east bleachers were rebuilt and bowled in .
Another change was the improvement of the sound system in the stadium .
The new stadium was rededicated during the 2003 home season opener versus the Auburn Tigers on September 2 , 2003 .
This addition of a north end zone upper deck brought Bobby Dodd Stadium to its current capacity .

The original stadium seated 5,600 .
First , the scoreboard was renovated and after completion , is now twice as big as the old scoreboard .
Also , ribbon boards were installed in front of the Wardlaw Center , as well as along the sides of the stadium .
The original all-steel 4,105-seat North stands were built in 1958 . In 1962 and 1968 the upper decks were added to the East and West sides bringing capacity to its all-time high of 58,121 .

Maybe it was named after the town of Aegae , or Aegea , a queen of the Amazons who died in the sea . Maybe it was named after Aegeus , the father of Theseus .
One chain goes across the sea to Chios , another one goes across Euboea to Samos , and a third one goes across the Peloponnese and Crete to Rhodes . This one divides -LRB- splits , cuts -RRB- the Aegean from the Mediterranean .
Wiley &apos; s Well is a remote , natural artesian well in the Colorado Desert of Southern California .
In 1985 , the Bureau of Land Management drilled a new well 965 &apos; \ / 294m deep to support the new Wiley &apos; s Well Campground , one of only two developed campgrounds in the Mule Mountains Long-Term Visitor Area .
Though winters are mild , making the campground popular with visitors who visit every year from colder areas , summer can be extremely hot with recorded temperatures as high as 130 Â F \ / 54 Â C.
The water is both hot at 90 Â F \ / 32 Â C and full of minerals . The water is pumped into a cistern to help cool it to drinking temperature .
They have been coming to Wiley &apos; s Well since the 1930s with the discovery of geode beds .
It is off the Wiley &apos; s Well Road exit from Interstate 10 , sixteen miles \ / 26km west of Blythe .
The entrance to the campground is nine miles \ / 14km south of the highway .
It is named after Palo Verde storekeeper and postmaster A.P. Wiley . In 1907 , Mr. Wiley dug deep into a shallow well dug in 1876 by a stagecoach company which used the nearby Bradshaw Trail .
Today , the well &apos; s original depth is only about 20 &apos; \ / 6m at best after wet weather . The water in the well is not good for drinking .
Wiley made the well larger since he hoped that he could attract business to his remote desert store . The well was taken care of by local ranchers and cattlemen for years afterward .
However , the rapidly falling level of the water meant a drop of the water &apos; s depth to 60 &apos; \ / 18m within a dozen years .
Even though Wiley &apos; s Well has been very popular with rockhounds over the decades , the area remains rich with such minerals as chalcedony , citrine , quartz crystals , rhyolite and jasper .

Some templates have their documentation on a separate \ / doc page , and then show that documentation in a green doc box below the template code by using the template .
-LRB- Although most users remove the sandbox notice when they copy the code from the \ / sandbox to the main template .
See more below . -RRB-
-LRB- See also Protection policy . -RRB-
Provided there is only one sandbox or testcases page in use for the particular main page , another option is to move the sandbox page to the standard &apos; &apos; \ / sandbox &apos; &apos; name , or testcases to &apos; &apos; \ / testcases &apos; &apos; .
If you do n &apos;t want a page to be categorised then use the template like this :
If you want to demonstrate the template on say Template messages \ / Template namespace then you need to feed the subpage-name to make it show and feed an empty category parameter so it does n &apos;t categorise the page .
To learn more about how to use template \ / sandbox and \ / testcases subpages see Template test cases .
It also detects when it is not on a \ / sandbox page and then shows nothing , thus it can be left in the code when copied and pasted to the main template .
If the \ / sandbox page has another name , for instance &apos; &apos; \ / sandbag &apos; &apos; , then you need to tell the sandbox notice the name of the page , so that it knows when to show and when not to show itself .
The notice-not-sandbox parameter can for instance be used so a protection template can be placed already in the \ / sandbox version of the code .
-LRB- See also Protection policy and Template documentation . -RRB-
Then place the sandbox notice like this :
This example handles both a protection template and a green doc box from a \ / doc page at the same time .
That may be preferable since other templates and tools also assume that the sandbox uses that name , such as .
This template categorises \ / sandbox pages into : Category : Template sandboxes .
This template uses case-insensitive matching , so will match &apos; &apos; \ / Sandbox &apos; &apos; , &apos; &apos; \ / SandBox &apos; &apos; , &apos; &apos; \ / sAnDbOx &apos; &apos; etc. without any special help .
Any blank space or newlines between the template code and the tag can cause the template to render unwanted spaces or newlines when used .
It can be placed on template \ / sandbox pages .
But beware , if the notice-not-sandbox parameter has been used then the sandbox notice must be copied with the rest of the template code .
-LRB- See also Template documentation . -RRB-
The sandbox notice can also help showing and hiding other things depending on if it detects it is on the \ / sandbox page or not .

Currently , WWE has the WrestleMania Revenge tour , after WrestleMania , at the beginning of the year and the Survivor Series tour , at the end of the year , in the UK .
In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland , some pay-per-views are shown on Sky Sports 1 and others on Sky Box Office .
Each includes a RAW , SmackDown ! , and an ECW taping .
Each month , WWE holds one or two annual pay-per-view events .
The first SummerSlam was held in Madison Square Garden in August 1988 .
Only the Royal Rumble , WrestleMania , SummerSlam and Survivor Series events used people from different brands .
The first two WrestleManias earned much money . After WrestleMania III became one of the best event in wrestling history , the WWF then decided to have more pay-per-views .
Beginning in 1996 , it began using other names along with the In Your House name -LRB- such as Bad Blood and No Way Out -RRB- . This was done to avoid confusion .
In Australia , WWE &apos; s pay-per-views are shown on Main Event .
These four events - the Royal Rumble in January , WrestleMania in March or April , SummerSlam in August , and Survivor Series in November - were the only annual pay-per-view offerings -LRB- other than the King of the Ring -RRB- from the WWF until 1995 .
Pay-per-view events are a big part of how the WWE earns money .
Many people believe wrongly that the first WWE , then known as the World Wrestling Federation -LRB- WWF -RRB- , pay-per-view was November 1985 &apos; s The Wrestling Classic . This was a tournament held at the Rosemont Horizon near Chicago .
The first Survivor Series event took place on November 29 1987 . It was shown at the same time as NWA &apos; s Starrcade which was thought to be the biggest yearly event for NWA .
Starting with the 2008 Royal Rumble , all WWE pay-per-views were broadcast in High-definition .

The Snowball Earth hypothesis has been invoked to explain glacial deposits in the Huronian supergroup of Canada . The palaeomagnetic evidence , which suggests ice sheets at low latitudes , is contested .
It was certainly less significant than the Sturtian or Marinoan glaciations , and probably not global in extent .
Even the leading Snowball proponent Hoffman agrees that the million year long Gaskiers glaciation did not lead to global glaciation , although it was probably as intense as the late Ordovician glaciation .
Snowball Earth or Icehouse Earth refers to times when the Earth &apos; s surface was nearly or entirely frozen .
The status of the Kaigas glaciation or `` cooling event &apos; &apos; is unclear . Some do not recognize it as glacial , and others believe it may indeed be a third ice age .
Perhaps the rise of free oxygen that occurred during this part of the Paleoproterozoic removed methane in the atmosphere through oxidation .
The glacial sediments of the Makganyene formation of South Africa are slightly younger than the Huronian glacial deposits -LRB- ~ 2.25 billion years old -RRB- and were deposited at tropical latitudes .
Evidence does suggest that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic .
Opponents do not draw the same inferences from the geological evidence , and doubt the geophysical feasibility of an ice or slush-covered ocean .
Of these , the Marinoan was the most significant , and the Sturtian glaciations were also truly widespread .
As the Sun was notably weaker at the time , the Earth &apos; s climate may have relied on methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , to maintain surface temperatures above freezing .
There were three or four significant ice ages during the late Neoproterozoic .
Proponents claim the theory explains sedimentary deposits of glacial origin at tropical latitudes and other enigmatic features of the geological record .
In the absence of this methane greenhouse , temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred .

Three Southampton trams have survived .
The last tram to pass through the central archway did so on 4 June 1938 . By this time part of Southampton ancient walls had been demolished so that the Bargate was passable on both sides .
However , the roadway through the arch in the Bargate still had to be lowered to allow the trams to pass through the arch . Some secret changing of the profile of the arch &apos; s masonry was also needed at the last minute .
By 1887 though the company had recovered . It had a good financial base to stand on , and it was paying divedends of 8 % a year to its shareholders .
Southampton Corporation Tramways was a transport company that opened in 1879 and closed in 1949 .
In 1923 a new design of enclosed double deck tram was built by P.J Baker , General Manager of the tramways . It had a rounded top that would fit through the arch .
These trams had smaller wheels to help reduce the tram &apos; s height . They were driven by high speed motors which produced more torque .
After the system closed some trams were sold to Leeds . The majority though were sent to A F Harris &apos; s scrapyard at Bevois Valley for scrapping .
The first tram route that opened was Stag Gate - Holy Rood . A second route opened on 6 May 1879 which was Alma Road - Canute Road - Oxford Street - High Street - Floating Dock and Stag Gates - Lodge Road - Portswood .
At first the trams were horse-drawn , but later they were powered by electricity .
The first tram ran on 5 May 1879 . The tramway made Â # 26 .
Also , a railway openened in 1839 and a horse-drawn omnibus service started at as well . By 1843 a regular service was running from the station to Millbrook , Eling , Bitterne , Shirley , Portswood , Totton and Romsey .
Southampton Tramways were mainly affected by staffing issues during World War I. To try and stop this women were allowed to become `` conductorettes &apos; &apos; .
Car No. 31 was destroyed by an incendiary bomb on 30 November 1940 .
Because of this toastrack tram No. 2 had a gangway cut through the middle of it .
Floating Bridge - Shirley , Holy Rood - High Street - Royal Pier and Roberts Road - Millbrook all closed on 31 December 1949 .
Trams started to pass around the East of the Bargate on 24 April 1932 .
To save the fleet of trams from the intensive bombing of Southampton during World War II they were painted gray . Regular services stopped at 7pm and they were parked up overnight in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common for the same reason .
In the early years of the war a tram went round Southampton for two hours twice a week . It had a military band playing on the top deck .
The Southampton Tramway Company was bought by Southampton Corporation on 30 June 1898 for Â # 51,000 .
Swaythling - Burgess Road - Bassett Crossroads - Avenue Junction closed on 5 March 1949 .
It was decided that buses were a better alternative to modernizing the trams .
Before 1932 , the only road route between Southampton High Street and Above Bar was through the arch in the center of the Bargate .
On the 22 October 1889 , the Portswood route ran via Spear Road and Avenue Road .
The incident caused some worry locally because it was thought that saboteurs were responsible .
The Corporation did not allow tram tracks to be put in the High Street and Above Bar .
Four new trams and forty horses were needed to run this service .
In 1876 Southampton Corporation saw that their public transport was not as good as the public transport in other cities .
The population was 27,000 people in 1841 . This was because the docks were becoming much more used .
Women were again employed by the company . Unlike in World War I though they were allowed to drive the trams this time .
The Southampton Tramways Company was made to build a new tramway system .
The tramway started to be built in the summer of 1878 .
Many people did not want the trams to run on a Sunday , and 3,500 people put their names on a petition to stop the trams running on a Sunday .
Southampton , a city of the United Kingdom located in Hampshire , was becoming bigger in the nineteenth century .
A few were sold on from there to be used as sheds or summer houses .
The unmanned convoy of trams was stopped by a lorry before anybody was hurt .
Swaythling - Portswood - Lodge Road - Stag Gates closed on 30 October 1948 .
It later emerged that the incident was due to a young boy playing on the trams .
World War II affected Southampton much more than World War One .
The Tramway Junction - Commercial Road - Shirley route opened on 9 June 1879 .
The last movement of a tram in Southampton was on 4 February 1950 when cars No. 21 and No. 101 were moved from Shirley depot to Portswood depot under their own power .
In November 1942 , a tram was accidentally set in motion whilst parked up overnight .
Fares cost less money in 1896 because they changed from 3d to 2d for `` through routes &apos; &apos; . The tram times became two times as fast to every 5 minutes from Stag Gates to Holy Rood .
By 1872 tramways were a lot more popular . The British and Foreign Tramway Company contacted Southampton Corporation with an idea to set up a tramway in the town .
The first line to close was Bitterne Park - St. Mary &apos; s - Docks on 15 May 1948 .

The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth called the growth in human numbers `` unprecedented &apos; &apos; , and stated that many environmental problems , such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , global warming , and pollution , were made worse by the population expansion .
Steve Jones , head of the biology department at University College London , has said , `` Humans are 10,000 times more common than we should be , according to the rules of the animal kingdom , and we have agriculture to thank for that .

A sender will encrypt data with the public key ; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data .
Some types the PRNGs algorithms utilize system entropy to generate a seed data , such seeds produce better results , since this makes the initial conditions of the PRNG much more difficult for an attacker to guess .
Public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key .
The simplest method to read encrypted data is a brute force attack -- simply attempting every number , up to the maximum length of the key .
Key generation is the process of generating keys for cryptography .
Therefore , it is important to use a sufficiently long key length ; longer keys take exponentially longer time to attack , making a brute force attack invisible and impractical .
The key is used to encrypt and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted .
Modern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms -LRB- such as DES and AES -RRB- and public-key algorithms -LRB- such as RSA -RRB- .
Modern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms -LRB- such as DES and AES -RRB- and public-key algorithms -LRB- such as RSA -RRB- . Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key ; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret .
In some cases keys are randomly generated using a random number generator -LRB- RNG -RRB- or pseudorandom number generator -LRB- PRNG -RRB- , the latter being a computer algorithm that produces data which appears random under analysis .
In computer cryptography keys are integers .
Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key ; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret .
The public key is made available to anyone -LRB- often by means of a digital certificate -RRB- .

Hall called him â unsentimental , dangerous and immensely powerfulâ , even the Sunday Timesâ curmudgeonly critic of the day called his performance â a decisive step in the direction of great tragedy ... great actingâ , while fellow actors paid him the rare compliment of applauding him in the dressing room on the first night .

David Hare &apos; s Skylight , with Lia Williams , which opened to rave reviews at the National in 1995 , transferred first to Wyndhams Theatre and then on to Broadway for a four-month run which left him in a state of advanced exhaustion .
Back at the National , now on the South Bank , his next turning point was Peter Hall &apos; s premiere staging of Harold Pinter &apos; s Betrayal , an unexpectedly subtle performance â &apos; &apos; a production photograph shows him embracing Penelope Wilton with sensitive hands and long slim fingers -LRB- the touch of a master clock-maker -RRB- .
His rise to stardom began in 1974 when Eric Thompson cast him as the melancholy vet in Alan Ayckbourn &apos; s The Norman Conquests at Greenwich .
Gambon married Anne Miller when he was 22 , but has always been secretive about his personal life , responding to one interviewer &apos; s question about her : `` What wife ? &apos; &apos;
Most recently , he was Joe in Beckett &apos; s Eh Joe , giving two performances a night at the Duke of York &apos; s Theatre in London .
He then moved to St Aloysius &apos; College in Hornsey Lane , Highgate , London , whose former pupils included Peter Sellers .
His craggy looks soon made him into a character actor , although he won critical acclaim as Galileo in John Dexter &apos; s production of The Life of Galileo by Brecht at the National Theatre in 1980 .
He is also one of the few actors to have mastered the harsh demands of the vast Olivier Theatre .
Gambon was invested by Prince Charles as a Knight Bachelor on 17 July 1998 for services to drama -LRB- Queen Elizabeth II &apos; s approval for the award was notified in the 1998 New Year Honours List -RRB- and his wife thus became Lady Gambon .

All investigations of causality coming later in history will consist in imposing a favorite hierarchy on the order -LRB- priority -RRB- of causes ; such as `` final -RRB- efficient -RRB- material -RRB- formal &apos; &apos; -LRB- Aquinas -RRB- , or in restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or , to the efficient causality -LRB- deterministic or chance -RRB- , or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena -LRB- the natural sciences describing how things happen rather than asking why they happen -RRB- .
The same language refers to the effects of causes ; so that generic effects assigned to generic causes , particular effects to particular causes , and operating causes to actual effects .
Both types of causes , can be spoken as potential or as actual , particular or generic .

These are particularly common in chip pan fires , which are responsible for one in five house fires in Britain every year .
Consequently , they are better suited when the goal is to move an object -LRB- a bullet in a gun , or a piston in an internal combustion engine -RRB- with the force of the expanding gas .
This simplified model neglects the change of temperature and thus the burning rate across the deflagration front .
Damage to buildings , equipment and people can result from a large-scale short-duration deflagration .
For a stationary moving deflagration front , these two timescales are equal : The heat generated by burning is equal to the heat carried away by heat transfer .
Between these extremes both heat and pressure are released .
In free-air deflagrations , there is a continuous variation in deflagration effects relative to maximum flame velocity .
The nature of the damage is primarily a function of the total amount of fuel burned in the event -LRB- total energy available -RRB- , the maximum flame velocity that is achieved , and the manner in which the expansion of the combustion gases is contained .
The water boils rapidly and ejects the burning material as a fine spray of droplets .
Typical examples of deflagrations are combustion of a gas-air mixture in a gas stove or a fuel-air mixture in an internal combustion engine , a rapid burning of a gunpowder in a firearm or pyrotechnic mixtures in fireworks .
The first is the thermal diffusion timescale , which is approximately equal to
The net result is that the volume of the vessel or structure needs to either expand \ / fail to accommodate the hot combustion gases , or build internal pressure to contain them .
When flame velocities are low , the effect of a deflagration is the release of heat .
Deflagration is different from detonation which is supersonic and propagates through shock compression .
When a low-speed deflagration occurs within a closed vessel or structure , pressure effects can produce damage due to expansion of gases , as a secondary effect .
We can better understand the underlying flame physics by constructing an idealized model consisting of a uniform one-dimensional tube of unburnt and burned gaseous fuel , separated by a thin transitional region of width in which the burning occurs .
The risks of deflagration inside waste storage drums is a growing concern among storage facilities .
Deflagration -LRB- Lat : de + flagrare , `` to burn down &apos; &apos; -RRB- is a technical term describing subsonic combustion that usually propagates through thermal conductivity -LRB- hot burning material heats the next layer of cold material and ignites it -RRB- .
where is the thermal diffusivity .
The second is the burning timescale that strongly decreases with temperature , typically as
Most `` fire &apos; &apos; found in daily life , from flames to explosions , is , technically , deflagration .
The burning region is commonly referred to as the flame or flame front .
At flame velocities near the speed of sound , the energy released is in the form of pressure and the results resemble a detonation .
As a result , this derivation gives the laminar flame speed -- hence the designation .
This lets us find the characteristic width of the flame front :
Addition of water to a burning hydrocarbon such as oil or wax produces a deflagration .
The heat released by the deflagration causes the combustion gases and excess air to try to expand thermally as well .
In equilibrium , thermal diffusion across the flame front is balanced by the heat supplied by burning .
see drum deflagration videos
Some authors use the term flash fire to describe these low-speed deflagrations .
where is the activation barrier for the burning reaction and is the temperature developed as the result of burning that can be found from thermodynamics -LRB- the so-called `` flame temperature &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
There are two characteristic timescales which are important here .
In engineering applications , deflagrations are easier to control than detonations .
A deflagration then occurs , as the fine mist of oil ignites and burns extremely rapidly .
Also this model neglects the possible influence of turbulence .

Mayor Gus Manuel on Galveston said that the NWS did an excellent job during Alicia .
The Small Business Administration , aided with 56 volunteers , interviewed over 16,000 victims , and was predicted that about 7000 loan applications would be requested .
30 percent of Galveston &apos; s population evacuated the island when Hurricane Allen threatened the eastern Texas coastline in 1980 ; only 10 percent of the population living behind the seawall chose to leave when Alicia made landfall .
In the end , Hurricane Alicia killed 21 people and caused $ 2 billion in damage -LRB- $ 5.27 billion in 2006 dollars -RRB- .
On the September 23 hearing , witnesses agreed that the National Weather Service did well before and during the emergency caused by Alicia .
The hearing on September 23 were to examine the main problems of the National Weather Service during Alicia , the effectiveness of the N.W.S in current events , and the use of the National Weather Service .
About 5 feet of sand was scoured , leaving beachfront homes in a natural vegetation state .
The first ones were a gale warning and a hurricane watch for the area of Corpus Christi , Texas to Grand Isle , Louisiana which was given out on August 16 .
Hurricane Alicia formed from Tropical Depression Three on August 15 in the Gulf of Mexico and slowly moved west towards Texas , where it made landfall on August 18 at its strongest point with 115 mph -LRB- 185 km \ / h -RRB- winds .
A major oil spill occurred around Texas City with over sixty gallons having to be cleaned up by the National Weather Service and an ocean-going tugboat capsized 50 miles of the Sabine Pass coast .
More than 16,000 people wanted help from FEMA &apos; s disaster service centers .
On the September 24 hearing , evidence was brought upon which demonstrated the need improving to the readiness to cope with disasters , such as Alicia .
The beachfront homes after Alicia were in violation of the Texas Open Beaches Act and the Attorney General &apos; s office forebade the repair or rebuilding of those homes .
He was also very impressed about their landfall predictions on August 17 , before Alicia made landfall .
On September 23 and September 24 , 1983 , in the wake of Alicia , two subcommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives had trials in Houston .
The Corps of Engineers stated that if the Galveston Sea Wall was not there , that another $ 100 million dollars in damage could have occurred .
Throughout the day , however , as increasing winds began to cause damage in Galveston , people grew more worried .
The mayor finally ordered a widespread evacuation of the island after midnight on August 18 , but by then the bridges to the mainland were no longer usable as they have been broken .
Hurricane Alicia was the first named storm and first hurricane of the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season .
The other nine were concentrated around Tyler to Houston , Texas , ranging around F2 on the Fujita scale .
The Federal Insurance Agency had closed over 1318 flood insurance cases from Alicia &apos; s effects , however only 782 received final payment .
Alicia also did damage to chemical and petrochemical plants in Houston .
FEMA gave out $ 32 million -LRB- 1983 USD -RRB- to Alicia &apos; s victims and local governments .
Originally , however , residents did not take the warnings seriously .
Pleasure Pier reported tides of 8.67 feet with Pier 21 reported a little over 5 Â 1 \ / 2 feet . Baytown , Texas reported 10-12 feet tides , and 12.1 feet at Morgan City , the highest recorded by Alicia .
On August 17 , a hurricane warning was issued for Corpus Christi to Morgan City , Louisiana and later for Port Arthur , Texas .
The Red Cross had to provide food and shelter to 63,000 people in the hurricane &apos; s wake , costing to about 166 million dollars .
The Coast Guard Air Station Houston -LRB- AIRSTA -RRB- weathered Alicia with minimal damage , and afterwards AIRSTA &apos; s helicopters helped residents with evacuation , supply , and survey flights .
Also , if Alicia was the size of Hurricane Carla from 1961 , damage could have easily double or possibly tripled .
It was replaced with Allison in the 1989 season . The name Allison was coincidentally retired after doing major damage to the same the area in 2001 .
Mayor Manuel mentioned that his town needed stronger building codes , which were under review .
Several hurricane watches and warnings were given out that were related with Alicia .
Twenty-three tornadoes were reported that were either related or caused by Alicia , fourteen of those were located in the Galveston and Hobby Airport area .
The city of Galveston reported 7 Â 3 \ / 4 inches of rain , Liberty reported 9 Â 1 \ / 2 inches , and Greens Bayou reported almost 10 inches of rain . Centerville reported over 8 inches with Normangee and Noxia reporting over 7 inches .
High gusts were also reported throughout Texas with a maximum gust of 125 mph reported on the Coast Guard cutter Buttonwood -LRB- WLB-306 -RRB- stationed at the northeastern part of Galveston Island .
Galveston Mayor E. Gus Manuel , against the advice of Texas Governor Mark White , ordered the evacuation of only low-lying areas .
The second hearing , which occurred on September 24 , was to talk about the damage and recovery efforts during Alicia .
The name Alicia was retired in the spring of 1984 , becoming the 30th storm name to be retired and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane .
$ 23 million of that was to go picking up trash and wrecked objects spread after Alicia .

Market capitalization represents the public opinion of the value of a company &apos; s equity .
Insurance firms use a value called the embedded value -LRB- EV -RRB- .
Market capitalization is the share price times by the number of shares in issue . This provides a total value for the company &apos; s shares and the value the company .
Market capitalization -LRB- often market cap -RRB- is a measurement of size of a business corporation . It is equal to the price of one share of stock , times the number of shares of stock in a public company .
The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world was US $ 51.2 trillion in January 2007 . In May 2008 to rose to US $ 57.5 trillion .
Market cap reflects only the equity value of a company .
A more comprehensive measure is enterprise value -LRB- EV -RRB- , which includes debt and other factors .
Note that market capitalization is a market estimate of a company &apos; s value .

In some non-English-speaking cultures , `` a divided by b &apos; &apos; is written a : b . However , in English usage the colon is restricted to expressing the related concept of ratios -LRB- then `` a is to b &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
But in elementary arithmetic this form is used rather often .
For example , a divided by b is written
In the above expression , a is called the dividend , b the divisor and c the quotient .
A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are integers -LRB- although typically called the numerator and denominator -RRB- .
This can be read out loud as `` a divided by b &apos; &apos; or `` a over b &apos; &apos; .
The obelus is also used alone to represent the division operation itself , as for instance as a label on a key of a calculator .
Any of these forms can be used to display a fraction .
A way to express division all on one line is to write the dividend , then a slash , then the divisor , like this :
Division is most often shown by placing the dividend over the divisor with a horizontal line , also called a vinculum , between them .
This is the usual way to specify division in most computer programming languages since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of characters .

When the attack did begin , the southern and western American defenses fell quickly .
The Battle of Fort Washington was one of the many battles fought in the American Revolutionary War between the United States and Great Britain that took place on 16 November 1776 .
Washington had thought of leaving the Fort and moving its military camp of 3,000 men to New Jersey , but had been convinced by General Nathaniel Greene to defend -LRB- fight for -RRB- it .
With the fort surrounded by land and sea the Fort &apos; s commander , Robert Magaw , chose to surrender the fort rather than try to hold out .
The assault came from three different directions : the north , east and south .
On 16 November , Howe attacked the fort .
The attack was put off for a short time because of the tides in the Harlem River that stopped some of the troops from landing .
After winning against the Continental Army -LRB- ruled by George Washington -RRB- , the British army -LRB- ruled by William Howe -RRB- wanted to capture Fort Washington , the last American stronghold in Manhattan .

He said the south side of the wall is packed with soil , which permits access to the top of the wall and makes it effectively invisible from the south side .
In the ceasefire of July 27 , 1953 , the DMZ was created . Each side agreed in the armistice to move their troops back 2000 m from the front line , creating a buffer zone 4 k wide .
In the North , Kijong-dong features a number of brightly painted , poured-concrete multi-story buildings and apartments with electric lighting .
Sporadic outbreaks of violence due to North Korean hostilities killed over 500 South Korean soldiers and 50 U.S. soldiers along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999 .
Another incident occurred on November 23 , 1984 , when a Soviet tourist , who was part of an official trip to the JSA -LRB- hosted by the North -RRB- , ran across the Military Demarcation Line -LRB- MDL -RRB- shouting that he wanted to defect .
Since then the resort , and the Donghae Bukbu Line have effectively been closed by the North .
Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ , but they may not cross the MDL .
The defector was not captured .
All tunnels were dug in a rock called granite . Some of the tunnel walls have been painted black to give the appearance of anthracite .
Currently the South uses the original name , but the North refers to the route as the P ` yÅ ngbu Line .
One South Korean and three North Korean soldiers were killed in the action .
Tae Sung Dong and Kijong-dong were the only villages allowed by the armistice committee to remain within the boundaries of the DMZ .

It is located between 50 a below ground , but is larger than the first , approximately 2 b .
In September 2009 , the Kaesong rail and road crossings were reopened .
However scrutiny with modern telescopic lenses reveals that the buildings are mere concrete shells lacking window glass or even interior rooms , with the building lights turned on and off at set times and the empty sidewalks swept by a skeleton crew of caretakers in an effort to preserve the illusion of activity .
Construction was designed to enlarge and modernize the structures .
Environmentalists hope that by the time reunification occurs , the former DMZ will be conserved as a wildlife refuge , with a well-developed set of objective and management plans vetted and in place .
Both North and South Korea maintain peace villages in sight of each other &apos; s side of the DMZ .
Five days later , during a subsequent exploration of this tunnel , U.S. Navy Commander Robert M. Ballinger and ROK Marine Corps Major Kim Hah Chul were killed in the tunnel by a North Korean explosive device .
The blast also wounded five Americans and one South Korean from the United Nations Command .
Today , the railway is mainly used to carry materials to the industrial complexes at Kaesong .
Engineering within the tunnels , following each discovery , has become progressively more advanced .
The conflict claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines . On June 25 , 1950 , a Soviet-sponsored DPRK invasion crossed the 38th parallel .
The new rail crossing was built next to the road which took South Koreans to KÅ mgangsan , a region that has significant cultural importance for all Koreans .
Residents of Tae Sung Dong are governed and protected by the United Nations Command and are generally required to spend at least 240 nights per year in the village to maintain their residency .
The first of the tunnels was discovered by a South Korean Army patrol , noticing steam rising from the ground .
In total , four tunnels have been discovered , the first on November 15 , 1974 .
When former South-Korean president Kim Dae-jung had died , a delegation from North Korea also attended his funeral . On that occasion , talks were held with South Korean officials .
In December 1999 , Chu Chang Jun , North Korea &apos; s longtime ambassador to China , repeated claims that a `` wall &apos; &apos; divided Korea .
This natural isolation along the 155 m length of the DMZ has created an involuntary park which is now recognized as one of the most well-preserved areas of temperate habitat in the world .
In late 2009 , South Korean forces and the United Nations Command began renovation of its three guard posts and two checkpoint buildings within the JSA compound .
The village is located on the main highway and near a railroad connecting the two Koreas .
Dutch journalist and filmmaker Peter Tetteroo shows footage of what he believes -LRB- at the prompting of his North Korean guides -RRB- to be the Korean Wall .
People given the permission to cross this border must do so on foot before continuing their journey by road .
A narrow gauge railway with carts had also been installed .
The initial discovery was met with machine gun fire from North Korean soldiers .
Several endangered animal and plant species now exist among the heavily fortified fences , landmines and listening posts .
The villagers of Tae Sung Dong are direct descendants of people who owned the land before the 1950-53 Korean War .
According to the United States , the wall does not exist , although there are anti-tank barriers along some sections of the DMZ .
However in November 2008 North Korean authorities closed the railway because of growing tensions with the South .
It is believed the tunnels were built to allow a North Korean military invasion .
In 2008 , the village had a population of 218 people .
Additional surveys are now being conducted throughout the region .
In 2005 , CNN founder and media mogul , Ted Turner , on a visit to North Korea , said that he would financially support any plans to turn the DMZ into a peace park and a UN-protected World Heritage Site .
The third tunnel was discovered on October 17 , 1978 .
The second tunnel was discovered on March 19 , 1975 .
The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command -LRB- primarily South Koreans and Americans -RRB- meet face to face .
All the tunnels run in a north-south direction and do not have branches .
The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design .
The DMZ cuts the Korean Peninsula almost in half , crossing the 38th parallel . The west end of the DMZ is south of the parallel and the east end is to the north of it .
The Military Demarcation Line -LRB- MDL -RRB- goes down the center of the DMZ and indicates exactly where the front was when the agreement was signed .
The road at Panmunjeom , which was known historically as Highway One in the South , was originally the only access point between the two countries on the Korean Peninsula .
This tunnel is about 1600 m long and about 150 m below ground .
The 38th parallel north cuts the Korean peninsula routhly in half . The parallel was the original boundary between the US-occupied and Soviet-occupied areas of Korea at the end of World War II .
Originally , it was the only connection between North and South Korea . In 2007 a Korail train crossed the DMZ to the North on the new Donghae Bukbu Line built on the east coast of Korea .
Villagers are classed as Republic of Korea citizens , however they are exempt from paying tax and other civic requirements such as military service .
In 1994 , North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor .
Inside the DMZ , near the western coast of the peninsula , is a place called Panmunjeom . The Joint Security Area -LRB- JSA -RRB- is located there .
The tunnel was reinforced with concrete slabs and had electric power and lighting .
Unlike the previous two , the third tunnel was discovered following a tip from a North Korean defector .
Border guards on the South Korean side returned fire eventually surrounding the North Koreans as they pursued the Russian national .
The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ .
The Korean Demilitarized Zone is a piece of land running across the Korean Peninsula that serves as a buffer zone between North and South Korea .
North Korea contends :
In 1998 , South Korea built a new Freedom House for its Red Cross staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the Korean War .
The railway , which connects Seoul and Pyongyang , was called the Gyeongui Line before Korea was divided in the 1940s .
There are several buildings on both sides of the Military Demarcation Line . A few are built right on top of the MDL .
The Axe Murder Incident in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a poplar tree which resulted in two deaths -LRB- CPT Arthur Bonifas and 1LT Mark Barrett -RRB- and Operation Paul Bunyan .
Until 2004 , massive loudspeakers mounted on several of the buildings continuously delivered DPRK propaganda broadcasts directed towards the south as well as propaganda radio broadcasts across the border .
More than one million civilian visitors crossed the DMZ until the route was closed after a 53-year-old South Korean tourist was shot in July 2008 .
Though generally calm , the DMZ has been the scene of much saber-rattling between the two Koreas over the years .
The town was oriented so that the bright blue roofs and white sides of the buildings would be the most distinguishing features when viewed from the border .
Panmunjeom is the site where the negotiations that ended the Korean took place . It is the main center of human activity in the DMZ today .
In the past half century , the Korean DMZ has been a deadly place for humans , making habitation impossible .
When the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea -LRB- DPRK , informally North Korea -RRB- and the Republic of Korea -LRB- ROK , informally South Korea -RRB- were created in 1948 , this line became a de facto international border between the two countries . It was also one of the most tense fronts in the Cold War .
It is of similar length to the first tunnel .
Passage is comparable to the strict movements that occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin at the height of the Cold War .
The Joint Security Area is the location where all negotiations since 1953 have been held , including statements of Korean solidarity , which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of tensions .
North Korean troops immediately chased after him opening fire .
Facing the UN buildings is DPRK &apos; s Panmungak and ROK &apos; s Freedom House .
Both North and South Korea &apos; s roads end in the Joint Security Area ; neither highway meets because there is a 20 c concrete line that divides the entire site .
Each tunnel is big enough , so an entire infantry division can pass in one hour , but the tunnels are too small for tanks or other vehicles .
For example , the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward , to prevent water stagnation .
These include the extremely rare Red-crowned Crane -LRB- a staple of Asian art -RRB- , and the White-naped crane as well as , potentially , the extremely rare Korean Tiger , Amur leopard and Asiatic black bear .
In the 1980s , the South Korean government built a 98.4 m flagpole in the village of Daeseong-dong .
Several small skirmishes have occurred within the Joint Security Area since 1953 .
Ecologists have identified some 2,900 plant species , 70 types of mammals and 320 kinds of birds within the narrow buffer zone .
Within the JSA are a number of U.N. buildings called Conference Row these are used for direct talks between the two Koreas .
In the South , Daeseong-dong is administered under the terms of the DMZ .
Estimates based on the tunnel &apos; s size , suggest it would have allowed approximately 2,000 KPA soldiers -LRB- one regiment -RRB- to pass through it per hour .
Foreign visitors touring the South Korean DMZ may view inside this tunnel using a sloped access shaft .
The DMZ owes its varied biodiversity to its geography which crosses mountains , prairies , swamps , lakes and tidal marshes .
Beforehand , the soldiers of both sides were permitted to go back and forth across the MDL inside of the JSA , a privilege since revoked as a result of this incident .
In 2007 , on the east coast of Korea , the first train crossed the DMZ on the new Donghae Bukbu -LRB- Tonghae Pukpu -RRB- Line .

By the eve of the First World War , the Ottoman state , despite its weakness vis - Ã - vis Europe , represented the largest and most powerful independent Islamic political entity .
However , the ShiË at Ë AlÄ `` , `` the Party of Ali &apos; &apos; , were again disappointed when the Abbasid dynasty took power , as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammad &apos; s uncle , ` Abbas ibn ` Abd al-Muttalib and not from Ali .
Large territories , including those with large Muslim populations , such as Crimea , were lost to the Russian Empire .
1258 saw the conquest of Baghdad and the execution of Abbasid caliph al-Musta ` sim by Mongol forces under Hulagu Khan .
Its leaders included Maulana Mohammad Ali , his brother Shawkat Ali , and Abul Kalam Azad , Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari , and Hasrat Mohani .
However , the Ottomans under Abdul Hamid I claimed a diplomatic victory by assigning themselves the protectors of Muslims in Russia as part of the peace treaty .
Mehmed II and his grandson Selim I used it to justify their conquest of Islamic countries .
The outcome of this war was disastrous for the Ottomans .
In areas which were previously under Persian or Byzantine rule , the Caliphs lowered taxes , provided greater local autonomy , greater religious freedom for Jews , indigenous Christians , and brought peace to peoples that were demoralized and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of Byzantine-Persian warfare .
Under him , the caliphate became a hereditary office for the first time . He founded the Umayyad dynasty .
Uthman was killed by members of an opposition group .
The Caliphate of CÃ rdoba -LRB- Ø Ù Ù Ù Ø Ù Ø Ø Ø Ø -RRB- ruled the Iberian Peninsula from the city of CÃ rdoba , from 929 to 1031 .
This made it one of the largest unitary states in history and one of the few states to ever extend direct rule over three continents -LRB- Africa , Europe , and Asia -RRB- .
Ottoman rulers used the title `` Caliph &apos; &apos; symbolically on many occasions but it was strengthened when the Ottoman Empire defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517 and took control of most Arab lands .
Then Ali took control . He was very popular with many , but he was not accepted as caliph by the governors of Egypt .
There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads , as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks -LRB- notably , the rivalry between Yaman and Qays -RRB- .
Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey -LRB- parliament -RRB- of the newly formed Turkish Republic and the title has since been inactive .
All Caliphs of CÃ rdoba were members of the Umayyad dynasty ; the same dynasty had held the title Emir of CÃ rdoba and ruled over roughly the same territory since 756 .
Although not ruling all of the Sahara , homage was paid to the Caliph by Saharan Africa usually via various nomad Berber tribes .
Ù Ø Ù Ø Ø Ø Ø -RRB- .
This period was characterized by remarkable success in technology , trade and culture ; many of the masterpieces of Spain were constructed in this period , including the famous Great Mosque of CÃ rdoba .
On March 3 , 1924 , the first President of the Turkish Republic , Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ 1 \ / 4 rk , as part of his reforms , constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate .
In the 1920s the Khilafat Movement , a movement to defend the Ottoman Caliphate , spread throughout the British colonial territories in Asia .
Muawiyah , a relative of Uthman , and governor -LRB- Wali -RRB- of Syria became one of Ali &apos; s challengers . After Ali &apos; s death he became Caliph .
It was particularly strong in British India , where it formed a rallying point for Indian Muslims and was the one of the many anti-British Indian political movements to enjoy widespread support .
Later the caliphate was won by the Abbasids and Al-Andalus -LRB- or Hispania -RRB- split from the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad to form their own caliphate .
During the Ummayad period Hispania was an integral province of the Ummayad Caliphate ruled from Damascus , Syria .
Around 1880 Sultan Abdul Hamid II reasserted the title as a way of countering the spread of European colonialism in Muslim lands .
This period is known as the Fitna , or the first Islamic civil war .
Eventually , supporters of the Banu Hisham and the supporters of the lineage of Ali united to bring down the Umayyads in 750 .
Some supported prominent early Muslims like Al-Zubayr ; others felt that only members of Muhammad &apos; s clan , the Banu Hashim , or his own lineage , the descendants of Ali , should rule .
Ottoman rulers were known primarily by the title of Sultan and used the title of Caliph only sporadically .
A surviving member of the Abbasid House was installed as Caliph at Cairo under the patronage of the Mamluk Sultanate three years later ; however , the authority of this line of Caliphs was confined to ceremonial and religious matters , and later Muslim historians referred to it as a `` shadow &apos; &apos; Caliphate .
Abu Bakr , the first successor of Muhammad , nominated Umar as his successor on his deathbed , and there was consensus in the Muslim community to his choice .
As the Ottoman Empire grew in size and strength , Ottoman rulers beginning with Selim I began to claim Caliphal authority .
For a time it worked in alliance with Hindu communities and was supported by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who was a member of the Central Khilafat Committee .
He had two major rebellions and was assassinated after a tumultuous rule of only five years .
Initially covering Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia and Libya , the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years , taking Egypt and Palestine , before the Abbassid dynasty was able to turn the tide , limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt .
Under the Umayyads the Caliphate grew rapidly geographically .
The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171 .
His claim was most fervently accepted by the Muslims of British India .
The ShiË a Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty , which claimed descendency of Muhammad through his daughter , claimed the title of Caliph in 909 , creating a separate line of caliphs in North Africa .
The title Caliph -LRB- Ø Ù Ù Ù Ø -RRB- was claimed by Abd-ar-Rahman III on January 16 , 929 ; he was previously known as the Emir of CÃ rdoba -LRB- Ø # Ù
His successor , Uthman Ibn Affan , was elected by a council of electors -LRB- Majlis -RRB- . But soon he was seen by some more as a `` king &apos; &apos; than as an elected leader .
The last Abbasid Caliph at Cairo , al-Mutawakkil III , was taken into custody and was transported to Istanbul , where he reportedly surrendered the Caliphate to Selim I. According to Barthold , the first time the title of `` Caliph &apos; &apos; was used as a political instead of symbolic religious title by the Ottomans was the peace treaty with Russia in 1774 .
Islamic rule expanded westward across North Africa and into Hispania and eastward through Persia and ultimately to Sindh and Punjab in modern day Pakistan .

Laura became reduced into a post-tropical cyclone later that morning , and the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on the storm .
Laura formed out of a large non-tropical low pressure area located 1015 miles -LRB- 1635 km -RRB- west of the western islands of the Azores on September 29 .
Laura slowly got tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters .
During the afternoon , satellites revealed that Laura had developed a deep warm core , a characteristic of a tropical cyclone , but the wind field remained subtropical in nature .
Tropical Storm Laura was the twelfth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season .
Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed because of bad driving conditions .
Despite moving over colder waters , a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low , signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone .
On the afternoon of September 30 , Laura had gotten enough tropical characteristics to be designated as a `` Tropical Storm &apos; &apos; .
Upon being upgraded , cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation .
Soon after becoming tropical , Laura began to start an extratropical transition , which did not completely take place until the morning of October 1 .
Overnight , convection associated with Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics , but still retained its status .
By September 29 , the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura .
The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying .
Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around the center of the system .
After the remains of now extratropical Laura made its final landfall on the southern coast of the Netherlands , its rain clouds started mix with a cold front related to a well-developed low west of Norway , dropping up to 113 mm -LRB- 4.5 in -RRB- of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands , flooding streets and homes in the village of Hippolytushoef .
By the nighttime hours , the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80 mi -LRB- 130 km -RRB- , much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone .
However , the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September 30 , but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical .
Early on October 1 , the extratropical transition was fully apparent .
However , Laura was still under the influence of an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow .
While Laura was a tropical cyclone , it never came near land , so no effects or damages happened and no one died .
More than 10,000 people lost electricity in southern Norway because of damage to the electrical system created by the remains of the storm .
A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60 mph -LRB- 95 km \ / h -RRB- .
Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day .
Because of that , Glebe Road near Windermere , England was closed in both directions , and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale , previously wet soil , as well with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding .
But , the storm &apos; s remains were caught in an upper-level jet stream , and was pushed towards Europe .
Not long after being declared tropical , early signs of an extratropical transition appeared .
Rocourt-Saint-Martin is a commune . It is found in the region Picardie in the Aisne department in the north of France .
There is no publication date and Wikipedia does not have to be finished today .
Perfection is neither desired nor achievable .
Wikipedia is not paper and has no need to work towards a deadline .
And if it takes a long time for that process to work , so what ?
There are two points of view on what this lack of a deadline means .
And if someone beats you to it , makes that first place in the edit history , so what ?
We can afford to take our time , to consider matters , to wait before creating a new article until its significance is unambiguously established .
There is no finished version expected soon , and it is perfectly acceptable to let the editing process fashion an article up to our standards eventually .
Wikipedia is a work in progress , and will always remain so .
Merge in what you have and turn a stub or whatever into a good article .
A small number of articles might make Wikipedia 1.0 , but the vast majority will not and for the balance there is no deadline .
Wikipedia is not a competition either .
It merely needs to have improved on yesterday .
Above all , creating an article which is unfinished is the -LRB- second rule -RRB- of Wikipedia . That way you encourage other people to contribute ; collaborating will earn you far greater respect .
There really are no points for being first ; being the author of the best and most neutral content will earn you far greater kudos .
Turn this into a strength by working on your article in your userspace or scratchpad until you have the best possible article , fully referenced , a masterpiece of neutrality .
Above all , creating an article without establishing the basis of the content and its significance is a bad idea .
Wikipedia is not working to a deadline .
Wikipedia is not Wikinews and has no need to scoop anyone .
We can afford to take our time to improve articles , to wait before deleting a new article until its lack of significance is unambiguously established .

A Molotov cocktail , also known as a petrol bomb , benzine torch , molotov grenade or a Molotov bomb , is the generic name for different kinds of simple incendiary weapons .
When Molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs but rather delivering food to the starving Finns , the Finns started to call the air bombs satirically `` Molotov bread baskets &apos; &apos; .

The equations result from applying Newton &apos; s second law to fluid motion , with the belief that the fluid stress is the sum of a diffusing viscous term -LRB- in relation to the gradient of velocity -RRB- , plus a pressure term .
The Navierâ `` Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars , the study of blood flow , the design of power stations , the analysis of pollution , and many other things .
Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid , however for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories .
These are called the Navierâ `` Stokes existence and smoothness problems .
They are very useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest .
A solution of the Navierâ `` Stokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field , which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time .
Once the velocity field is solved for , other quantities of interest -LRB- such as flow rate or drag force -RRB- may be found .
The Navierâ `` Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense .
They may be used to model the weather , ocean currents , water flow in a pipe , the air &apos; s flow around a wing , and motion of stars inside a galaxy .

This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics , where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a Particle or deflect of a continuum .
The Navierâ `` Stokes equations dictate not position but rather velocity .
Together with Maxwell &apos; s equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics .
The Navierâ `` Stokes equations are mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids .

The French annexed the Batavian Republic in 1810 , and Overijssel was organised into the new French dÃ partement of Bouches-de-l ` Yssel .
In the northwest , the geology is mostly made of sediments from the Overijsselse Vecht and clay .
After the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 , the kingdom of the Netherlands and the former province of Overijssel were recreated .
Only small patches survive today -LRB- Engbertsdijksvenen near Tubbergen , Witteveen -LRB- near Haaksbergen -RRB- , and the Aamsveen -LRB- near Enschede -RRB- .

The northern parts were once covered by veen -LRB- bogs -RRB- which separated the dryer and more arable south from Drenthe . These bogs have been exploited as fuel to a large degree .

Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download -LRB- for example , Baltimore &apos; s Schismatik record label ships CDs for a nominal charge -RRB- .
In the early days of the recording industry , record labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist .
Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made .
With the Internet now being a viable source for obtaining music , we see the emergence of net labels .
Such labels have a reputation for being fiercely uncompromising and especially unwilling to cooperate with the Big Five record labels at all .
Many artists have had albums changed or censored in some way by the labels before they are released -- songs being edited , artwork or titles being changed , etc . .
The singer turned down lucrative contracts from several top-name labels in order to establish her own New-York-based company .
Entertainment lawyers are used by some to look over any contract before it is signed .
Depending on the ideals of the net label , music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via paypal or an online payment system .
This approach has been around since the early 1980s , in an attempt to stay true to the punk ideals of doing it yourself and not selling out to corporate profits and control .
In the 1990s , due to the widespread use of home studios , consumer CD recorders , and the Internet , independent labels began to become more commonplace .
Often the record label &apos; s decisions are correct ones from a commercial perspective , but this typically frustrates the artist who feels that their artwork is being destroyed .
These are inspired by the free software and open-source movement and the success of GNU \ / Linux .
Most net labels acknowledge the Creative Commons licensing system thus reserving certain rights for the artist .
The new century brings the phenomenon of open-source or open-content record label .
Some independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases , purchase the label completely .
Constant touring resulted in noteworthy success for an act without significant major funding .
The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible .
Ani and others from the company have spoken on several occasions about their business model in hopes of encouraging others .
While there are many independent labels , folk singer Ani DiFranco &apos; s Righteous Babe Records is often cited as an ideal example .
In the 1940s , 1950s and 1960s , many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they usually ended up signing a bad contract , sometimes giving away the rights to their music in the process .
In spite of the fact that both parties need each other to survive , the relationship between record labels and artists can , at times , be a difficult one .
In the 1970s and 1980s , there was a phase of consolidation in the record industry that led to almost all major labels being owned by a very few multinational companies , who in turn were members of the RIAA .
On the punk rock scene , the DIY punk ethic encourages bands to self-publish and self-distribute .

Bodybuilders use weight training to improve their body image by developing their muscles for size , shape , and symmetry regardless of any increase in strength for competition in bodybuilding contests ; they train to maximize their muscular size and develop extremely low levels of body fat .
Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement .
Although weight training is similar to bodybuilding , they have different objectives .
In contrast , many weight trainers train to improve their strength and anaerobic endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat far below normal .
Weight training is a common type of strength training .
However , as with any form of exercise , improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury .
Weight training , however , is often a part of the athlete &apos; s training regimen .
By increasing muscular strength and improving balance , weight training can reduce falls by elderly persons as well .

This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on .
Adaptive radiations commonly follow mass extinctions : following an extinction , many niches are left vacant .
Birds find other ways to provide for each other , ie . the evolution of flight opened new possibilities , and an adaptive radiation occurred .
The colonizing population may diversify rapidly to take advantage of all possible niches .
An example of a more modest innovation is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth .
Adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism entering an environment with unoccupied niches , such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain .
Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of ecological niches available to mammals .
In Lake Victoria , an isolated lake which formed recently in the African rift valley , over 300 species of cichlid fish adaptively radiated from one parent species in just 15,000 years .
A classic example of this is the replacement of the non-avian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous with mammals in the Palaeocene .
The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the Cenozoic , and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation .

There are examples of episodes , ostensibly having been the `` season finale &apos; &apos; , unexpectedly becoming the de facto series finale due to the cancellation of the series .
A season finale may contain a cliffhanger ending to be resolved in the next season .
Alternatively , a season finale could bring open-ended storylines to a close , `` going out on a high &apos; &apos; and similarly maintaining interest in the series &apos; eventual return .
This is often the final episode to be produced for a few months or longer , and , as such , will try to attract viewers to continue watching when the series begins again .
The final episode of a television series often concludes the entire premise of the show .

The vampire squid can grow to about 30 cm -LRB- 1 foot -RRB- in total length .
What behavioural data known has been gleaned from ephemeral encounters with ROVs ; animals are often damaged during capture and survive for no more than about two months in aquaria .
Few specifics are known regarding the ontogeny of the Vampire Squid .
It has special filaments it can retract ; because of this , it has been placed in its own order : Vampyromorphida -LRB- formerly Vampyromorpha -RRB- . It has similarities with both squid and octopi .
Like other deep-sea cephalopods , Vampire Squid have no ink sacs .
Until fairly recently known only from the modern species and some fossil remains tentatively allocated to this group , a batch of Middle Jurassic -LRB- Lower Callovian , c.165-164 mya -RRB- specimens found at La Voulte-sur-Rh Ã ne demonstrated that clearly vampyromorphid cephalopods were in existence for far longer than has been hitherto believed .
The animals have weak musculature but maintain agility and buoyancy with little effort thanks to sophisticated statocysts -LRB- balancing organs akin to a human &apos; s inner ear -RRB- and ammonium-rich gelatinous tissues closely matching the density of the surrounding seawater .
The Vampire Squid is an extreme example of a deep-sea cephalopod . People think it lives at aphotic -LRB- lightless -RRB- depths from 600-900 metres -LRB- 2,000-3 , 000 feet -RRB- or more .
Once she does , she may need to brood over them for up to 400 days before they hatch .
If a predator were to bite off an arm tip , the Vampire Squid can regenerate it .
Their blue blood &apos; s hemocyanin binds and transports oxygen most efficiently , aided by gills with especially large surface area .
`` vampire squid from hell &apos; &apos; -RRB- is a small , deep-sea cephalopod . It can be found throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world .
Copepods , prawns and cnidarians have all been reported as prey of Vampire Squid .
Appearing as small white discs , the photophores are larger and more complex at the tips of the arms and at the base of the two fins . They are absent from the underside of the caped arms .
In order to cope with life in the suffocating depths , vampire squid have developed several radical adaptations .
Hatchlings are about 8 mm in length and are well-developed miniatures of the adults , with some differences .
The Vampyromorphida are characterized by such apomorphies as the possession of photophores , a peculiar type of uncalcified endoskeleton called `` gladius &apos; &apos; , 8 webbed arms and the 2 velar filaments .
It is the only surviving member of its order . It was first described and mistakenly identified as an octopus in 1903 by German teuthologist Carl Chun .
They are capable of swimming at speeds equivalent to two body lengths per second , with an acceleration time of five seconds .
The chromatophores -LRB- pigment organs -RRB- common to most cephalopods are poorly developed in Vampire Squid .
A webbing of skin connects its eight arms , each lined with rows of fleshy spines or cirri . The inside of this `` cloak &apos; &apos; is black .
Nonetheless , the Vampire Squid is able to live and breathe normally in the OMZ at oxygen saturations as low as 3 % ; something no other cephalopodâ &apos; &apos; and few other animalsâ &apos; &apos; can claim .
Within the OMZ oxygen saturation is too low to support aerobic metabolism in most higher organisms .
Within the webbing are two pouches . These pouches hide the tactile velar filaments .
The female may store a male &apos; s hydraulically implanted spermatophore -LRB- a sort of tapered , cylindrical satchel of sperm -RRB- for long periods before she is ready to fertilize her eggs .
At the shallower end of the Vampire Squid &apos; s vertical range , the view from below is like the sky at twilight : The highly sensitive eyes of deepwater dwellers are able to distinguish the silhouettes of other animals moving overhead .
The filaments are analogous to a true squid &apos; s tentacles , extending well past the arms , however , they are a different arm pair than the squid &apos; s tentacles .
If hypotheses may be drawn from knowledge of other deep-sea cephalopods , the Vampire Squid likely reproduces slowly by way of a small number of large eggs .
Their powerful beak-like jaws are as white as ivory .
Instead , the filaments are the same pair that were lost by the ancestral octopuses .
Their arms lack webbing , their eyes are smaller and their velar filaments are not fully formed .
A pair of photoreceptors are located on top of its head , perhaps alerting the animal to movements above .
The glowing arm tips are clustered together far above the animal &apos; s head , diverting attack away from critical areas .
Only the distal half -LRB- farthest from the body -RRB- of the arms have suckers .
The Vampire Squid is covered entirely in light-producing organs called photophores .
Its 15 cm -LRB- 6 inch -RRB- gelatinous body varies in color between velvety jet-black and pale reddish , depending on location and lighting conditions .
Of all deep-sea cephalopods , their mass-specific metabolic rate is the lowest .
Little else is known regarding their feeding habits .
Its own large eyes detect even the faintest of gleams .
The Vampire Squid -LRB- Vampyroteuthis infernalis , lit .
If the filaments contact an entity , or if vibrations impinge upon them , the animals investigate with rapid acrobatic movements .
This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past , with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families -LRB- Young 2002 -RRB- .
Within this region of the world &apos; s oceans is a discrete habitat known as the oxygen minimum zone -LRB- OMZ -RRB- .
The intensity and size of the photophores can also be varied .
Whereas the young propel themselves primarily by jet propulsion , mature adults find flapping their fins to be the most efficient means .
The supposed vampyromorphids from the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian -LRB- 156-146 mya -RRB- of Solnhofen , Plesioteuthis prisca , Leptoteuthis gigas , and Trachyteutis hastiformis , can not be clearly assigned to this group ; they are large species -LRB- from 35 cm in P. prisca to -RRB- 1 meter in L. gigas -RRB- and show features not found in vampyromorphids , being somewhat similar to the true squids , Teuthida -LRB- Fischer &amp; Riou 2002 -RRB- .
The smaller animals frequent much deeper waters , perhaps feeding on marine snow -LRB- falling organic detritus -RRB- .
Given their low metabolic rate and the low density of prey at such depths , Vampire Squid must use innovative predator avoidance tactics in order to save energy .
Its limpid , globular eyesâ &apos; &apos; which appear red or blue , also depending on lightingâ &apos; &apos; are proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom at 2.5 cm -LRB- 1 inch -RRB- in diameter .
The vastness of their habitat and its sparse population make procreative encounters a fortuitous event .
With their long velar filaments deployed , Vampire Squid have been observed drifting along in the deep , black ocean currents .
If threatened , instead of ink , a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light is ejected from the arm tips .
This luminous barrage , which may last nearly 10 minutes , is presumably meant to daze would-be predators and allow the Vampire Squid to disappear into the blackness without the need to swim far .
They serve as the adult &apos; s primary means of propulsion -LRB- moving around -RRB- : Vampire Squid are said to `` fly &apos; &apos; through the water by way of flapping their fins .
The animal has great control over the organs . It is capable of producing disorienting flashes of light for fractions of a second to several minutes in duration .
The display is made only if the animal is very agitated ; regenerating the mucus is costly from a metabolic point of view .
These were described as Vampyronassa rhodanica .
The hatchlings are transparent and survive on a generous internal yolk for an unknown period before they begin to actively feed .
While this means the animal is not capable of changing its skin color in the dramatic fashion of shallow-dwelling cephalopods , such trickery is not needed at the pitch black depths in which it lives .
An artificial environment makes reliable observation of non-defensive behavior difficult .
However , their weak muscles limit stamina considerably .
As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops , the fins are resized and repositioned in order to maximize gait efficiency .
Two larger white areas on top of the head were initially believed to be photophores too , but have turned out to be photoreceptors .
Their aforementioned bioluminescent `` fireworks &apos; &apos; are combined with the writhing of glowing arms , erratic movements and escape trajectories . These features make it difficult for a predator to home in .
The female will not eat towards this culmination and dies shortly thereafter .
Mature adults have a pair of ear-like fins . These fins stand out from the lateral sides of the mantle .
Unlike their relatives living in more hospitable depths , deep-sea cephalopods can not afford to spend energy in protracted flight .
Vampire Squid have been found among the stomach contents of large deepwater fish , deep diving whales and pinnipeds such as sea lions .
Growth is slow as food is not abundant at depths where the animals live .
To combat this , the vampire squid generates its own bluish light -LRB- bioluminescence -RRB- in a strategy called counterillumination : The light diffuses the animal &apos; s silhouette , effectively `` cloaking &apos; &apos; its presence from the watchful eyes below .
Their development progresses through three morphologic forms : the very young animals have a single pair of fins , an intermediate form has two pairs , and the mature form again has one .
In a threat response called `` pumpkin &apos; &apos; or `` pineapple posture &apos; &apos; , the Vampire Squid inverts its caped arms back over the body , presenting an ostensibly larger form covered in fearsome-looking though harmless spines -LRB- called cirri -RRB- . The underside of the cape is heavily pigmented , masking most of the body &apos; s photophores .

Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network , decryption is easy ; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse .
The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly , so quickly that the cipher was broken using differential cryptanalysis at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel .
Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on DES , their main change was spliting the DES 64 bits data block into two unequal halves in the Feistel network , 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function , whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block .
MacGuffin &apos; s key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself .

Plutarch -LRB- AD 46 â `` 120 -RRB- wrote that during his visit to Alexandria in 48 BC , Julius Caesar might have accidentally burned the library when he set fire to his own ships to frustrate Achillas &apos; attempt to limit his ability to communicate by sea .
According to the earliest source of information , the library was initially organized by Demetrius of Phaleron , a student of Aristotle , under the reign of Ptolemy I Soter -LRB- ca .367 BCâ &apos; &apos; ca .283 BC -RRB- .
King Ptolemy II Philadelphus -LRB- 309 â `` 246 BC -RRB- is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library .
A single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls .
However , the exact layout is not known .
As the same text often existed in several different versions , comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their accuracy .
It did so through an aggressive and well-funded royal mandate involving trips to the book fairs of Rhodes and Athens and a policy of pulling the books off every ship that came into port .
It was the first known library to gather a serious collection of books from beyond its country &apos; s borders . The Library was charged with collecting all the world &apos; s knowledge .
The ancient Library of Alexandria was a large and significant library of the ancient world . It was founded in Alexandria , Egypt .
No index of the library survives , and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been .
The Library flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship . It was built in the third century BC .
These included , among others ,
The Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002 near the site of the old library .
Ptolemy happily paid the fee but kept the original scripts for the library .
Alexandria , because of its man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the Pharos island , welcomed trade from the East and West , and soon found itself the international hub for trade , as well as the leading producer of papyrus and , soon enough , books .
By decree of Ptolemy III of Egypt , all visitors to the city were required to surrender all books and scrolls .
It was rumored that carved into the wall above the shelves , a famous inscription read : The place of the cure of the soul .
The library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics , astronomy , physics , natural history and other subjects .
Once ascertained , copies would then be made for scholars , royalty and wealthy bibliophiles the world over , this commerce bringing income to the library .
It was at the Library of Alexandria that the scientific method was first conceived and put into practice , and its empirical standards applied in serious textual criticism .
The editors at the Library of Alexandria are especially well known for their work on Homeric texts .
This process also helped to create a reservoir of books in the relatively new city .
This model &apos; s influence may still be seen today in the layout of university campuses .
Papyrus scrolls comprised the collection , and although parchment codices were used predominantly as a more advanced writing material after 300 BC .
The hall contained shelves for the collections of scrolls -LRB- as the books were at this time on papyrus scrolls -RRB- , known as bibliothekai -LRB- Î Î Î Î &apos; &apos; Î Î Î á Î Î Î -RRB- .
The more famous editors generally also held the title of head librarian .
A perhaps exaggerated story concerns how the library &apos; s collection grew so large .

It was first seen by Carl Murray of the Cassini Imaging Science Team in pictures taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on June 21 , 2004 , and announced on September 9 , 2004 .
Another object , , was seen nearby 5 hours later , but this time just inside the F Ring .
Because of the different location of the second object , it was given a fresh designation , although their interpretation as a single object on a F-ring crossing orbit is also possible .
Such an object might also be orbiting at a bit different inclination to the F ring , thereby not actually passing through the ring material even though it was being seen both radially inward and outward of it .
This suggests that it was a clump of material that had disappeared by that time .

Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient , names are taken from a reserve list of names , with the first ten published every year .
If a storm ever reached the magnitude that might otherwise have led to retirement , the storm would be listed with the retired names with a footnote indicating the Greek letter would still be available for future storms .
Should a tropical cyclone pass from one warning center to another it will retain its original name , except when moving into the South-West Indian Ocean where the Mauritius Meteorological Service will rename the system .
New name lists are used every year , whilst a name is normally only used once so thus no names are retired .
Should a Tropical Depression intensify to the south of 25 Â S between 160 Â E and 120 Â W , it will be named in conjunction with the Fijian national weather service by the New Zealand &apos; s national weather service .
PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility , and any tropical cyclone that moves into their area of responsibility .
Names from List A are assigned in a random order while list B details replacement names for list A which will be added in the bottom of list A to maintain the alphabetical order .
The National weather service of Mauritius name the storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55 Â E and 90 Â E ; if the storm should intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 30 Â E and 55 Â E then the national weather service of Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm .
Within the Eastern Pacific Ocean two offices of the United States National Weather Service assign names to tropical cyclones when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 65 km \ / h , -LRB- 40 mph -RRB- .
The list of names were selected between 2000 and 2004 by the countries of the WMO \ / ESCAP Panel on tropical cyclones , before the actual naming of tropical cyclones began in September 2004 .
Within the Australian Region there are five different offices that assign names to tropical cyclones .
The last name to be used from this list was Omeka , whilst the next will be Pewa .
If all of the names on a list are used , storms are then named after the letters of the Greek alphabet -LRB- Alpha , Beta , Gamma , etc . -RRB- .
When a tropical low intensifies into a tropical cyclone between 10 Â S and 40 Â S and between 90 Â E - 160 Â E , then it will be named by one of three Australian national weather service offices in Perth , Darwin , or Brisbane .
Starting with Anika , the names are assigned in alphabetical order with the lists used in rotating order without regard to year .

Certainly , an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take attempts if each key is n bits long , compared to the attempts required for a single key .
However , Diffie and Hellman , discovered a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme .
where E is the encryption function -LRB- cipher -RRB- , and K1 and K2 are the two keys .
When trying to improve the security of a block cipher , one might get the idea to simply use two independent keys to encrypt the data twice and think that this would square the security of the double-encryption scheme .
The attacker can then compute EK -LRB- P -RRB- for all possible keys K and store the results in memory .
Assume the attacker knows a set of plaintext and ciphertext : P and C. That is , ,
Afterwards he can decrypt the ciphertext by computing DK -LRB- C -RRB- for each K. Any matches between these two resulting sets are likely to reveal the correct keys .
It was first developed as an attack on an attempted expansion of a block cipher by Diffie and Hellman in 1977 .
While the birthday attack attempts to find two values in the domain of a function that map to the same value in its range , the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to find a value in each of the ranges and domains of the composition of two functions such that the forward mapping of one through the first function is the same as the inverse image of the other through the second function -- quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function .
The Meet-in-the-middle attack is a cryptographic attack which , like the birthday attack , makes use of a space-time tradeoff .
-LRB- To speed up the comparison , the EK -LRB- P -RRB- set is stored in an in-memory lookup table , then each DK -LRB- C -RRB- can be matched against the values in the lookup table to find the candidate keys . -RRB-
If the keysize is n , this attack uses only encryptions -LRB- and space -RRB- in contrast to the naive attack , which needs encryptions -LRB- but only space -RRB- .

Security features introduced in then recently released Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities .
In IE , support was , and still is , provided only for the native Windows ICO format ; in other browsers it has now been extended to other types of images such as PNG and GIF .
There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software &apos; s true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert .
On December 16 , 2008 , Trend Micro recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency IE patch was released to fix a potential security risk which `` could allow outside users to take control of a person &apos; s computer and steal their passwords &apos; &apos; .

By religion the population was 19,916,438 Hindu , 4,567,295 Muslim , 535,950 Jain , 78,552 Zoroastrian , and about 200,000 Christian .
The Bombay Presidency had a large and diverse population .
The British took over Surat in 1800 .
In Gujarat the main religion is Hinduism , although Muslim kingdoms have left their influence in many parts of the province .
The first British settlement in the Bombay Presidency was in 1618 , when the East India Company established a factory at Surat . The British were protected by a charter from the Mughal Emperor Jahangir .
In 1950 Bombay Province was reorganised into Bombay State , which included the princely states .
The main languages of the Presidency were Sindhi in Sindh , Kutchi in Kutch , Gujarati and Hindustani in Gujarat , Marathi in Thana and the central division , Gujarati and Marathi in Khandesh , and Marathi and Kannada in the southern division .
It consisted partly of districts , which were directly under British rule , and partly of native or princely states , which were ruled by local rulers under the administration of a governor .
At its greatest extent , the Bombay Presidency was made up of the present-day state of Gujarat , the western two-thirds of Maharashtra state , including the regions of Konkan , Desh , and Kandesh , and northwestern Karnataka state of India ; It also included Pakistan &apos; s Sindh province and the British territory of Aden in Yemen .
In 1661 Bombay was given to the British government , as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza when she married Charles II of England .

This is about the speed with which the echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites . The word aculeatus means `` spiny &apos; &apos; or `` equipped with spines &apos; &apos; .
The subspecies are also different from each other as to hairiness , spine length and width , and the size of the claws on their back feet .
During courtship â &apos; &apos; observed for the first time in 1989 â &apos; &apos; males locate and pursue females .
Suckling gradually decreases until juveniles are weaned at about six months of age .
Many groups have myths about the animal ; one myth explains that it was created when a group of hungry , young men went hunting at night and stumbled across a wombat .
The age of sexual maturity is uncertain , but may be four to five years .
The Short-beaked Echidna is an iconic animal in modern Australia . It appears on the Australian five-cent piece -LRB- the smallest denomination -RRB- and on a $ 200 commemorative coin released in 1992 .
Little is known about their distribution in New Guinea , they have been found in southern New Guinea between Merauke in the west , to the Kelp Welsh River , east of Port Moresby in the east , where they may be found in open woodland .
The earholes are on either side of the head , with no external pinnae .
The protruded tongue is stiffened by the rapid flow of blood , allowing it to penetrate wood and soil .
The spines , which may be up to 50 mm long , are modified hairs , mostly made of keratin .
This has conservation implications for the endangered species of echidna from the genus Zaglossus , and to a lesser extent for the Short-beaked Echidna .
The mouth of the Short-beaked Echidna can not open wider than 5 mm . The body of the Short-beaked Echidna is , except for the underside , face and legs , covered with cream-coloured spines .
It has one of the shortest spinal cords of any mammal , extending only as far as the thorax .
The male is often observed to roll the female onto her side and then assumes a similar position so that the two animals are abdomen to abdomen .
The Short-beaked Echidna has been included in several postal issues : it was one of four native species to appear on Australian postage stamps in 1974 , where it was the 25 cent stamp ; it appeared on a 37 cent stamp in 1987 , and again in 1992 when it was on the 35 cent stamp .
Ten days after it is laid , the egg hatches within the pouch .
Like the platypus it has a low body temperature â &apos; &apos; between 30 and 32 Â C. Unlike the platypus , which shows no evidence of torpor or hibernation , the body temperature of the echidna may fall as low as 5 Â C. The Echidna does not pant or sweat and normally seeks shelter in hot conditions .
The tongue of the Short-beaked Echidna is the animal &apos; s only way of catching prey . It can stick out up to 180 mm outside the snout .
The embryo develops an `` egg tooth &apos; &apos; during incubation , which it uses to tear open the egg ; the tooth disappears soon after hatching .
In cooler parts of their range , such as Tasmania , females may mate within a few hours of arousal from hibernation .
The Short-beaked Echidna was first described by George Shaw in 1792 .
Juveniles are eventually ejected from the pouch at around two to three months of age , because of the continuing growth in the length of their spines .
They threw spears at the wombat , but lost sight of it in the darkness .
Species of the Tachyglossidae are egg-laying mammals ; together with the related family Ornithorhynchidae , the Platypuses , they are the only living monotremes in the world .
It is not threatened with extinction , but human activities , such as hunting , habitat destruction , and the introduction of foreign predatory animals and parasites , have reduced the places where the Short-beaked Echidna can be found in Australia .
Because of the low body temperature of the Short-beaked Echidna , it becomes sluggish in very hot and very cold weather .
The Short-beaked Echidna has a well-developed olfactory system , which may be used to detect mates and prey .
Trains of up to ten males may follow a single female in a courtship ritual that may last for up to four weeks ; the duration of the courtship period varies with location .
Like the other monotremes , the Short-beaked Echidna lays eggs . The monotremes are the only mammals that lay eggs .
Following the gestation period , a single rubbery-skinned egg between 13 and 17 millimetres in diameter is laid directly into a small , backward-facing pouch that has developed on her abdomen .
The anthropomorphic Echidna Millie was a mascot for the 2000 Summer Olympics .
By contraction of various parts of this muscle the Short-beaked Echidna can change shape . The most common shape change is achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened , protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines .
The muscles of the Short-beaked Echidna have a number of unusual features .
The way in which puggles drink the milk is not yet known , but they have been observed drinking large amounts during each feeding period , since mothers may leave them unattended in the burrow for between five and ten days .
In autumn and winter the Echidna shows periods of torpor or deep hibernation .
The brain and central nervous system of the Short-beaked Echidna have been extensively studied for evolutionary comparison with placental mammals .
Before mating , the male smells the female , paying particular attention to the cloaca .
When the tongue is retracted , the prey is caught on backward-facing keratinous `` teeth &apos; &apos; , located along the roof of the buccal cavity . This allows the animal to both capture and grind food .
Short-beaked Echidnas can live anywhere where there is a good supply of food .
The claws on the back feet are longer and curve backwards to help cleaning and grooming between the spines .
The solitary Short-beaked Echidna looks for a mate between May and September ; the precise timing of the mating season varies with geographic location .
Short-beaked Echidnas feature in the animistic culture of Indigenous Australians , including their visual arts and stories .
Sticking out the tongue is achieved by contracting the circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forward , and contraction of two muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the mandible .
Retraction requires the contraction of two internal muscles .
The Echidna &apos; s fur may be infested with what is said to be the world &apos; s largest flea , Bradiopsylla echidnae , which is about 4 mm long .
He named the species Myrmecophaga aculeata . He thought it might be related to the South American anteater .
It has a highly sensitive optic nerve . It has been shown to have visual discrimination and spatial memory comparable to those of a rat .
Gestation takes between 21 and 28 days , during which time the female constructs a nursery burrow .
The Short-beaked Echidna can live as long as 45 years in the wild .
The Short-beaked Echidna -LRB- Tachyglossus aculeatus -RRB- is 1 of 4 living types of echidna . It is also known as the Spiny Anteater because it eats ants and termites .
The tongue moves with great speed , and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute .
Fertilisation occurs in the oviduct .
The wombat adapted the spears as its own defense and turned into an Echidna .
In agricultural areas , they are most likely to be found in uncleared scrub ; they may be found in grassland , arid areas , and in the outer suburbs of the capital cities .
Fur color changes with geographic location .
The tongue is sticky because of the presence of glycoprotein-rich mucous . This mucus both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites , which stick to it .
Each mating results in the production of a single egg , and females are known to mate only once during the breeding season ; each mating is successful .
In Australia they are most common in forested areas where there are many termite-filled fallen logs .
There is an enormous muscle that is just beneath the skin and covers the entire body .
Only five zoos have managed to breed a captive Short-beaked Echidna , but no captive-bred young have survived to be adults .
The Tasmanian subspecies , T. a. setosus , is larger than the Australian mainland species .
In Australia , it is the most widespread native mammal . In New Zealand it is known as the Mungwe in the Daribi and Chimbu languages .
Captive breeding is difficult , partly because of the relatively infrequent breeding cycle .
Short-beaked Echidnas find food by smell , using sensors in the tip of their beak , and regularly feast on ants and termites .
The duration of lactation is about 200 days , and the young leave the burrow between 180 and 240 days .
The eyes are small and at the base of the wedge-shaped beak .
Because the neck can not be seen , the head and body appear to join together .
They have fur between the spines , which ranges in color from honey to a dark reddish-brown and even black . The underside and short tail are also covered in fur .
A twelve-year field study , published in 2003 , found that the Short-beaked Echidna reached sexual maturity between five and 12 years of age , and that the frequency of reproduction varies from once every two years to once every six years .
The Short-beaked Echidna is the only member of its genus , sharing the family Tachyglossidae with the surviving three species of the genus Zaglossus that live in New Guinea .
Another story tells of a greedy man that kept food from his tribe ; warriors speared him and he crawled away into the bushes , where he was turned into an Echidna , the spears becoming his spines .
The species was a totem for some groups , including the Noongar people from Western Australia , who called the animal the Nyingarn .
There are five subspecies of the Short-beaked Echidna , each live in different areas .
The Short-beaked Echidna is covered in fur and spines . It has a special nose -LRB- snout -RRB- and a special tongue that lets the echidna catch its prey at a great speed .

According to tradition , she discovered silk and invented the silk loom in the 28th century BC .
A fine thread started to separate itself from the cocoon .
She collected some cocoons , and then sat down to have some tea .
She is credited with inventing the silk reel , which joins thin silk threads into a thicker thread strong enough for weaving .
She asked her husband to give her a grove of mulberry trees , where she could keep the worms that made these cocoons .
Leizu shared what she found out with others and the knowledge became common .
Another story says that she found silkworms eating the mulberry leaves and spinning cocoons .
Leizu found that she could unwind this soft and lovely thread around her finger .
She is also credited with inventing the first silk loom .
It is not known how much , if any , of this story is true , but historians do know that silk was first made in China .
While she was sipping a cup of tea , she dropped a cocoon into the steaming water .
Leizu was a legendary Chinese queen .
When the silk ran out , she saw a small cocoon , and realized that this cocoon was the source of the silk .

In 1944 this transforming principle was identified as being genetic by Oswald Avery , Colin MacLeod , and Maclyn McCarty .
Griffith discovered that a harmless strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae could be made virulent after being exposed to heat-killed virulent strains .
Griffith thoought some `` transforming principle &apos; &apos; from the heat-killed strain was responsible for making the harmless strain virulent .
They isolated DNA from a virulent strain of S. pneumoniae and using just this DNA were able to make a harmless strain virulent .
Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A. tumefaciens so other methods were developed including electroporation and micro-injection .
Transformation was first demonstrated in 1928 by British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith .
Transformation did not become routine procedure in laboratories until 1972 when Cohen successfully transformed Escherichia coli by treating the bacteria with calcium chloride .
Introduction of foreign DNA into eukaryote cells is usually called `` transfection &apos; &apos; .
The results of these experiments were at first sceptically received by the scientific community . Not until the discovery of other methods of genetic transfer -LRB- conjugation in 1947 and transduction in 1953 -RRB- by Joshua Lederberg were Avery &apos; s experiments accepted .
Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System -LRB- gene gun -RRB- by John Sanford in 1990 .
They called this uptake and incorporation of DNA by bacteria ` transformation &apos; .
By removing the genes in the plasmid which caused the tumor and adding in new genes researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants .
This created an efficient and convenient procedure for transforming bacteria and opened the way for biotechnology and research .
Transformation may also used to describe the insertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells including animal and plant cells .
Transformation is one of three processes by which outside genetic material may be got into bacterial cells . The other two are conjugation -LRB- transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct contact -RRB- , and transduction -LRB- injection of foreign DNA by a bacteriophage into the host -RRB- .
In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors , Agrobacterium tumefaciens , was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid .

Elephants replace their teeth six times .
The African Forest Elephant has a longer and narrower mandible , rounder ears , a different number of toenails , straighter and downward tusks , and considerably smaller size .
The front pair wear down and drop out in pieces as the Two new molars emerge in the back of the mouth and the old molars shift forward .
Fossil Loxodonta have only been found in Africa , where they developed in the middle Pliocene .
With regard to the number of toenails : the African Bush Elephant normally has 4 toenails on the front foot and 3 on the hind foot , the African Forest Elephant normally has 5 toenails on the front foot and 4 on the hind foot -LRB- like the Asian elephant -RRB- , but hybrids between the two species commonly occur .
An anonymous author romanized the spelling to Loxodonta and the ICZN recognizes this as the proper authority .
Although it is commonly believed that the genus was named by Georges Cuvier in 1825 , Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte .
African elephants are the two species of elephants in the genus Loxodonta , one of the two existing genera in Elephantidae .
Their tusks are teeth , the second set of incisors become the tusks .
The African elephant nominally has governmental protection , but poaching is still a serious issue .
They are used for digging for roots and stripping the bark off trees for food , and , fighting each other during mating season , or defending themselves against predators .
Poaching significantly reduced the population of Loxodonta in certain regions during the 20th century .
At about 40 to 60 years of age the elephant no longer has teeth and will likely die of starvation , a common cause of death .
Human encroachment into or adjacent to natural areas where bush elephants occur has led to recent research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans , including the discovery that playback of the recorded sounds of angry honey bees are remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area .
An example of this poaching pressure is in the eastern region of Chadâ &apos; &apos; elephant herds there were substantial as recently as 1970 , with an estimated population of 400,000 ; however , by 2006 the number had dwindled to about 10,000 .

This position in the Federal Government of the United States is similar to the finance ministers of other nations .
From Morris &apos; s 1784 resignation until 1789 , the young union &apos; s finances were overseen by a three-member Treasury Board .
From the U.S. Department of the Treasury website : `` The Secretary of the Treasury is the principal economic advisor to the President and plays a critical role in policy-making by bringing an economic and government financial policy perspective to issues facing the government .
The Secretary is responsible for formulating and recommending domestic and international financial , economic , and tax policy , participating in the formulation of broad fiscal policies that have general significance for the economy , and managing the public debt .
Morris had held a similar position as Superintendent of Finance under the Continental Congress .
Note : Robert Morris was the first person appointed Secretary of the Treasury by George Washington , but Morris declined this office ; thus the 1st Secretary of the Treasury was Alexander Hamilton - appointed at Morris &apos; s suggestion .
The Secretary oversees the activities of the Department in carrying out its major law enforcement responsibilities ; in serving as the financial agent for the United States Government ; and in manufacturing coins and currency .
The United States Secretary of the Treasury is the head of the United States Department of the Treasury . He is concerned with finance and monetary matters , and , until 2003 , some issues of national security and defense .

In most of the cases artivists attempt to push political agendas by the means of art and especially , but not only street art .
Artivism developed since the Berlin wall collapsed while the anti-globalization and antiwar protests emerged and proliferated .
A typical short term goal of artivists is to reclaim public space , especially by subvertising or destroying ads in urban areas or city transportation systems .
Nevertheless artivists engage in different media like the internet not only for actions which could be described as hacktivism .
In some cases , Paris in 2003 for instance , artivists were arrested for acts of political art that verged on property destruction .
Often the acts of artivists can be refererred to as part of the larger concept of Culture jamming .
Artivists are often found in Social center .

The comet was later observed as a series of fragments ranging up to 2 k in diameter .
It was the first comet observed to be orbiting a planet , and had probably been captured by the planet around 20 â `` 30 years earlier .
These fragments collided with Jupiter &apos; s southern hemisphere between July 16 and July 22 , 1994 , at a speed of approximately 60 km \ / s . The prominent scars from the impacts were more easily visible than the Great Red Spot and persisted for many months .
Calculations showed that its unusual fragmented form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992 .
At that time , the orbit of Shoemaker-Levy 9 passed within Jupiter &apos; s Roche limit , and Jupiter &apos; s tidal forces had acted to pull the comet apart .
Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was a comet that broke apart , and crashed into Jupiter in July 1994 . For the first time , people could see how objects in the solar system , outside Eath collided .
This generated a large amount of coverage in the popular media , and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide .
The comet was discovered by astronomers Carolyn and Eugene M. Shoemaker and David Levy .
Shoemaker-Levy 9 , was found on the night of March 24 , 1993 , in a photograph taken with the 40 c Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California . At the time it had been captured by Jupiter , and was orbiting around the planet .
The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its role in reducing space debris in the inner solar system .

DNA repair means a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome .
In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as UV light can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day .
Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell &apos; s ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes .
The rate of DNA repair is dependent on many factors , including the cell type , the age of the cell , and the extracellular environment .
Consequently , the DNA repair process must be constantly active so it can respond rapidly to any damage in the DNA structure .
Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell &apos; s genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis .

Its apparently low density suggests that , unlike 10 Hygiea , 704 Interamnia and 52 Europa , Euphrosyne is a loosely-packed rubble pile -LRB- an asteroid that has been broken apart by a collision with all the pieces pulled together by gravity -RRB- .
It is a normal C-type asteroid with a primitive surface .
Its rotation period is very common for big asteroids , but nothing is known of its axial tilt .
It was the first asteroid found from North America .
31 Euphrosyne is one of the biggest main belt asteroids , found by James Ferguson on September 1 , 1854 .
During a rare perihelic opposition Euphrosyne is very high in the sky from northern latitudes , but invisble from such countries as New Zealand and Chile .
Consequently Euphrosyne is never visible with binoculars , having a maximum magnitude at the best possible opposition of around + 10.2 , which is actually fainter than any of the thirty asteroids previously found .
Its orbit , however , is quite unusual . It &apos; s orbit is similar to that of 2 Pallas in its high inclination and eccentricity .
It is named after Euphrosyne , one of the Charites in Greek mythology .
Whereas Pallas and Eris - the only bigger bodies with comparably tilted orbits - have nodes near perihelion and aphelion , Euphrosyne &apos; s perihelion lies at the northernmost point of its orbit .

Some maintain a silent protest against the event .
The Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit is a street circuit around Albert Park Lake , only a couple of kilometres south of central Melbourne .
It is used once a year as a racetrack for the Australian Grand Prix and associated support races .
The flat terrain around the lake , coupled with a track design that features few true straights , means that it is not easy to pass another car on the track . Watching the entire race track can only be done from a grandstand seat .
The circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake , a small man-made lake just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne .
Albert Park has the distinction of being the only venue to hold the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-World Championship formats .
Prior to the Grand Prix , a modified version of the current circuit was used for both the 1953 and 1956 Grands Prix .
During this time Albert Park ran anti-clockwise as opposed to the current GP circuit standard clockwise .
The course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive . Drivers have commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times .
As a result , the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface .

However , these phrases were a later development , most likely used to help remember the correct lettersâ &apos; &apos; something known as a backronym .
When radio transmitters that could send audio were developed , there was a need for a spoken distress phrase , and `` Mayday &apos; &apos; was adopted by the 1927 International Radio Convention as the equivalent of SOS .
On January 20 , 1914 , the London International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea adopted the Morse code signal TTT -LRB- â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; -RRB- , three letter T &apos; s -LRB- â &apos; &apos; -RRB- spaced correctly as three letters so as not to be confused with the letter O -LRB- - - - -RRB- , as the `` Safety Signal , &apos; &apos; used for messages to ships `` involving safety of navigation and being of an urgent character . &apos; &apos;
The fact that SOS can be read right side up as well as upside down became important for visual recognition if viewed from above .
It was introduced by the German government in radio regulations on April 1 , 1905 . It became the worldwide standard when it was included in the second International Radiotelegraphic Convention , which was signed on November 3 , 1906 .
In popular usage , SOS became associated with phrases such as `` Save Our Souls , &apos; &apos; `` Save our Ship &apos; &apos; `` Save Our Shelby , &apos; &apos; `` Shoot Our Ship &apos; &apos; , `` Sinking Our Ship &apos; &apos; , `` Survivors On Shore &apos; &apos; , and others .
However , there was some resistance among the Marconi operators about adopting the new signal , and , as late as the April , 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic , the ship &apos; s Marconi operators intermixed CQD and SOS distress calls .
During the Second World War , additional codes were used to include immediate details about attacks by enemy vessels , especially in the Battle of the Atlantic .
In both the April 1 , 1905 German law , and the 1906 International regulations , the distress signal was specified as a continuous Morse code sequence of three-dits \ / three-dahs \ / three-dits , with no mention of any alphabetic equivalents .
The signal SSS signalled attacked by submarines , whilst RRR warned of an attack by a surface raider , QQQ warned of an unknown raider -LRB- usually an auxiliary cruiser -RRB- , and AAA indicated an attack by aircraft .
However , in International Morse three dits make the letter S , and three dahs the letter O , and it soon became common to refer to the distress signal as `` SOS . &apos; &apos;
Article XVI of the regulations adopted Germany &apos; s Notzeichen distress signal as the international standard , reading : `` Ships in distress shall use the following signal : Â Â Â â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; Â Â Â repeated at brief intervals &apos; &apos; .
-LRB- In American Morse code , which was used by many coastal ships in the United States through the first part of the twentieth century , three dahs stood for the numeral `` 5 &apos; &apos; , so in a few cases the distress signal was informally referred to as `` S5S &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
In International Morse Code , three dits form the letter S , and three dahs make the letter O , so `` SOS &apos; &apos; became an easy way to remember the correct order of the dits and dahs .
The German government issued a set of national radio regulations . These were used from April 1 , 1905 .
Thus , under the modern notation , the distress signal becomes SOS .
In order to designate the proper sequence of dits-and-dahs for a long special symbol , the standard practice is to list alphabetic characters which contain the same dits-and-dahs in the same order , with a bar atop the character sequence to indicate that there should not be any internal spaces in the transmission .
There was no problem as long as operators were aware that `` SOS &apos; &apos; was technically just a convenient way for remembering the proper sequence of the distress signal &apos; s total of nine dits and dahs .
In 1906 , the second International Radiotelegraphic Convention was held in Berlin . This convention developed many Service Regulations to be added to the main agreement , which was signed on November 3 , 1906 , and became effective on July 1 , 1908 .
In contrast to CQD , which was sent as three separate letters with spaces between each letter , the SOS distress call has always been transmitted as a continuous sequence of dits-and-dahs , and not as individual letters .
SOS has also sometimes been used as a visual distress signal , consisting of three-short \ / three-long \ / three-short light flashes , or with `` SOS &apos; &apos; spelled out in individual letters , for example , stamped in a snowbank or formed out of logs on a beach .
They were usually sent in conjunction with the SOS distress code .
They introduced three new Morse code sequences , including the SOS distress signal :
In later years , the number of special Morse symbols increased .
SOS -LRB- Â Â Â â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; Â Â Â -RRB- is a Morse code . It is used as distress code , to signal danger .
-LRB- In International Morse , VTB , IJS and SMB , among others , would also correctly translate into the Â Â Â â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; Â Â Â distress call sequence , but traditionally only SOS is used -RRB- .
From the beginning , the SOS distress signal has actually been a continuous sequence of three-dits \ / three-dahs \ / three-dits , all run together without letter spacing .
The first ship to transmit an SOS distress call appears to have been the Cunard liner Slavonia on June 10 , 1909 , according to `` Notable Achievements of Wireless &apos; &apos; in the September , 1910 Modern Electrics .
In modern terminology , SOS is a `` procedural signal &apos; &apos; or `` prosign &apos; &apos; , and the formal way to write it is with a bar above the letters . It should be written SOS .
An early report on `` The International Radio-Telegraphic Convention &apos; &apos; in the January 12 , 1907 Electrical World said that `` Vessels in distress use the special signal , SOS , repeated at short intervals . &apos; &apos;

Because of this , the condition is sometimes called daltonism . As of 2009 , the word daltonism is used for only one type of color blindness called red \ / green color blindness .
Males have one X and one Y chromosome ; females have two X chromosomes . Many of the genes involved in making color vision work are on the X chromosome .
In addition , some color blind people find it easier to tell the difference between colors on artificial materials , such as plastic or in acrylic paints , than on natural materials , such as paper or wood .
Good graphic design avoids using color coding or color differences alone to give information . This does not only help color blind people , but also normally sighted people .
Thirdly , for some color blind people , color can only be distinguish if there is enough color : thin lines might appear black , but a thicker line of the same color can be seen in the correct color .
This is important to know when designing the interfaces for objects that need to be used in an emergency situation , like emergency brakes , or emergency phones .
The English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific article about color blindness in 1798 , after he found out that he suffered from color blindness himself . The article was called `` Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colors &apos; &apos; .
Most color blindness is permanent , but some conditions can also lead to temporary color blindness .
Some types of color blindness , but not inherited color blindness , can be cured .
Color blindness can therefore also result if these areas of the brain , the optic nerve or the retina have been damaged .
Color blindness is usually thought of as a disability . However , people who are color blind have an advantage : they are sometimes better at seeing through some types of camouflage .

The cipher is a 32-round substitution-permutation network operating on a block of four 32-bit words .
Serpent has a block size of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128 , 192 or 256 bits .
The Serpent cipher has not been patented .
However , many cryptanalysts believe that if implementations considered to overcome the XSL attack , the XSL attack would be more difficult than a brute force attack .
This maximizes parallelism , but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on DES .
For that reason , Rijndael was selected as the winner in the AES competition .
Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel , using 32 1-bit slices .
Each round applies one of eight 4-bit to 4-bit S-boxes 32 times in parallel .
It is completely placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone .
The XSL attack , if effective and would weaken Serpent -LRB- though not as much as it would weaken Rijndael , which became AES -RRB- .
Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher which was the second finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard -LRB- AES -RRB- contest after Rijndael .
Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson , Eli Biham , and Lars Knudsen .
Serpent was widely viewed as a more traditional approach to security than the other AES finalists choosing a larger security margin : the designers estimated 16 rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack , but specified 32 rounds as insurance against future progress in cryptanalysis .
The 32 rounds make Serpent more secure than Rijndael ; however , Rijndael with 10 rounds is faster and easier to implement for small Block ciphers and on embedded system .

When the line closed it was carrying just 80 passengers a day . Local lore said that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the nuclear bunker at Doddinghurst .
At one point the line owned two trains of 1962 tube stock .
Between 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was closed for engineering works .
The railway also owns four Finnish steam locomotives , and two wooden-bodied Finnish coaches .
The works included general station maintenance , rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance .

It was also in need of some expensive maintenance work . On 30 September 1994 , the line was closed to the public .
These units were taken away to be cut up for scrap in 1998 and 2003 , respectively , after they were destroyed by vandals .
Instead , a shuttle service between Epping -LRB- to connect with trains to London -RRB- and Ongar was used . At one stage , it was possible to see the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side-by-side at Epping .
Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on Sunday 28 May 2006 to passengers . At first though it was not possible to use the station buildings .
However , because the electrification did not cost much , the branch was only able to have special two - or three-car trains running on it . This was because the power supply was not strong enough to support trains that had more cars .
The station building still survives as a private residence . However , the platform has been removed .
At this time the London Passenger Transport Board &apos; s New Works project extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains . The Central Line would take over the railway from British Rail .

Markets for trading commodities can be very efficient , particularly if the division into pools matches demand segments .
In the original and simplified sense , commodities were things of value , of uniform quality , that were produced in large quantities by many different producers ; the items from each different producer are considered as of the same value .
This problem was extensively debated by Adam Smith , David Ricardo and Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow among others .
In classical political economy and especially Karl Marx &apos; s critique of political economy , a commodity is simply any good or service offered as a product for sale on the market .
Value and price are not equivalent terms in economics , and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and Marxist economists .
Marx &apos; s analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods , using the labor theory of value .
Some items are also seen as being treated as if they were commodities , e.g. human labor or labor power , works of art and natural resources , even though they may not be produced specifically for the market , or be non-reproducible goods .
These markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find a price .

In the former Soviet Union , oblasts were one of the types of administrative divisions of the union republics .
In 1929 , oblasts were replaced with larger administrative units known as banovinas .
According to the Constitution of Russia , oblasts are considered to be subjects of the Federation , which is a higher status than that of administrative units they had within the Soviet Union .
During that period , the country was divided into 33 oblasts .
Since 1997 , Bulgaria has been divided into 28 oblasti , usually translated as provinces .
With a few exceptions , Soviet oblasts were named after their administrative centers .
Oblasts were administrative units of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes between 1922 and 1929 .
Oblasts are a type of administrative division of Belarus , Bulgaria , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia , Ukraine , and the no longer existing Soviet Union .
As any administrative units of this level , oblasts were composed of districts -LRB- raions -RRB- and cities \ / towns directly under oblasts &apos; jurisdiction .
The last translation may lead to confusion , because the subdivision of `` oblast &apos; &apos; is called `` raion &apos; &apos; which can be translated as `` region &apos; &apos; or `` district &apos; &apos; as well .
The word `` oblast &apos; &apos; is used in English as well , but it is often translated as `` area &apos; &apos; , `` zone &apos; &apos; , `` province &apos; &apos; , or `` region &apos; &apos; .
The federal subject status gives the oblasts some degree of autonomy and gives them representation in the Federation Council .
Oblast is a type of administrative division in Slavic countries and some countries of the former Soviet Union .
These oblasts were later merged into the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the Republika Srpska .
Before , the country was divided into nine bigger units , also called oblast .
The majority of then-existing oblasts were on the periphery of the country or covered the areas where Cossacks lived .
The names of oblasts did not usually correspond to the names of the historical regions , as they were created as purely administrative units .
During the Wars -RRB- that split Yugoslavia several Serbian Autonomous Oblasts were formed in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
In the Russian Empire , oblasts were considered to be administrative units and were included as parts of Governorates General or krais .
Official terms in successor states of the Soviet Union differ , but some still use a cognate of the Russian term , e.g. voblast -LRB- voblasts , voblasts &apos; , -RRB- is used for provinces of Belarus , and oblys -LRB- plural : oblystar -RRB- for provinces of Kazakhstan .

Apple licensed the iCal name from Brown Bear Software , who have used it for their iCal application since 1997 .
This issue is specific to Google Calendar users .
Updates to Snow Leopard 10.6.1 and 10.6.2 have not addressed these problems .
iCal &apos; s development has since been transferred to Apple US headquarters in Cupertino .
These problems include alarms not firing ; all alarms being set to one fixed date and time in the past , preventing them from firing ; alarms from repeat events being fired for all historic occurrences of that repeated event , resulting in dozens of alarms for one event .
iCal supports times zones , i. e : if the function is enabled , and the computer &apos; s time zone changes , all the events in iCal are shifted to compensate for the time zone difference .
As of today , there is still no fix for this bug .
The release of Snow Leopard introduced several bugs into Snow Leopard , with regard to iCal alarms .
It has been reported that some users of iCal who have their calendar on a CalDAV server can not view or add events to their calendar .
Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X v10 .4 , Version 3 with Mac OS X v10 .5 and Version 4 as part of Mac OS X v10 .6 .
iCal was the first calendar application for Mac OS X to offer support for multiple calendars and the ability to publish \ / subscribe calendars to WebDAV server .
Originally released as a free download for Mac OS X v10 .2 on September 10 2002 , with the release of Mac OS X v10 .3 it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 1.5 .
The bug is that this function also occur when it is turned off , therefore when ever the computer &apos; s time zone changes , all the events in iCal shift as well .
iCal development is quite different from other Apple software because it was designed independently by a small French team working `` secretly &apos; &apos; in Paris , led by Jean-Marie Hullot , a friend of Steve Jobs .
iCal is a personal calendar application made by Apple Inc. that runs on the Mac OS X operating system .
The height of the tip where it always has the same current can be measured , too -LRB- constant current mode -RRB- .

In the 1970s , technologies were based on integrated circuits . Microprocessors , such as the Intel 4004 made computers smaller and cheaper .
This is known as `` stored program architecture &apos; &apos; or von Neumann architecture .
Most of the technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s , but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture .
With the evolution of the Internet , personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household .
A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time . The first of these was completed in Great Britain .
The first to be demonstrated working was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine -LRB- SSEM or `` Baby &apos; &apos; -RRB- , while the EDSAC , completed a year after SSEM , was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design .
Shortly afterwards , the machine originally described by von Neumann &apos; s paperâ &apos; &apos; EDVACâ &apos; &apos; was completed but was not ready for two years .
Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture in some form .
The 1980s also saw home computers and personal computer .
The length of day and night could be changed -LRB- AKA re-programmed -RRB- every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year .
Most historians agree that the `` castle clock &apos; &apos; , an astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206 , is the first known programmable analog computer .
John von Neumann talked about this design in the paper First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC , distributed in 1945 .
In 1801 , Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave .
It showed the zodiac , the solar and lunar orbits , a crescent moon-shaped pointer traveling across a gateway that made some doors to open every hour , and five robotic musicians who play music when levers hit them .
One of the first examples of this was built by Hero of Alexandria -LRB- c . 10 â `` 70 AD -RRB- . He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums .
In the 1950 &apos; s computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes . Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960 &apos; s because they were smaller and cheaper .
There are three types of computers : desktop computers , mainframes , and embedded computers .
Avant-garde refers to experimental work in art , music , culture , or politics .
The main idea is to keep Ubuntu &apos; s ease of use and mix it with popular penetration testing tools .
It includes some of the most used security programs for Linux , such as Wireshark , nmap , dSniff , and Ettercap .

Typically one part has a spike at its end , and the other part a pencil , or sometimes a pen .
Circles can be made by fastening one leg of the compasses into the paper with the spike , putting the pencil on the paper , and moving the pencil around while keeping the hinge on the same angle .
A compass -LRB- or pair of compasses -RRB- is a drawing tool that can be used for making circles or arcs .
The most rigorous definition of this abstract tool is the `` collapsing compass &apos; &apos; ; having drawn a circle from a given point with a given radius , it disappears ; it can not simply be moved to another point and used to draw another circle of equal radius -LRB- unlike a real pair of compasses -RRB- .
Compass and straightedge construction is used to illustrate principles of plane geometry .
The hinge is set in such a way that the distance between the spikes on the map represents a certain distance in reality , and by measuring how many times the compasses fit between two points on the map the distance between those points can be calculated .
The radius of the circle can be adjusted by changing the angle of the hinge .
Although a real pair of compasses is used to draft visible illustrations , the ideal compass used in proofs is an abstract creator of perfect circles .
Compasses are usually made of metal , and consist of two parts called legs connected by a hinge which can be adjusted .
They can also be used as a tool to measure distances , in particular on maps .
Distances can be measured on a map using compasses with two spikes .
Compasses can be used for mathematics , drafting , navigation , and other purposes .

Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere .
Continental lithosphere is typically ~ 200 km thick , though this also varies considerably between basins , mountain ranges , and stable cratonic interiors of continents .
Typically , the thickness varies from about 6 km thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than 100 km at subduction zones .
Because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards , it gets thicker as it moves further away from the mid-ocean ridge .
These plates move at one of three types of plate boundaries .
There are eight major and many minor plates . The lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere .
Earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain-building , and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries .
There are eight major and many minor plates .

This happens when the Pluto-Charon orbital plane is edge-on as seen from Earth , which only happens at twice in Pluto &apos; s 248-year orbital period .
Later observations of Pluto were able to figure out that the bulge was due to a smaller body .
Later , after a new technology called adaptive optics was discovered , it was possible to see Pluto and Charon as separate disks using ground-based telescopes .
Charon was found by astronomer James Christy on June 22 , 1978 , when he was looking at highly blown up picture of Pluto on a photographic plate that taken a couple of months before .
Any final doubts were erased when Pluto and Charon entered a five-year period of mutual eclipses between 1985 and 1990 .
Christy noticed that a slight bulge was able to be seen every now and then .
This finding was made public on July 7 , 1978 .
The orbit of the bulge fit in with Pluto &apos; s rotation period , which was already known from Pluto &apos; s light curve .
Later , the bulge was confirmed on plates dating back to April 29 , 1965 .
It was very lucky that one of these intervals happened to occur so soon after Charon &apos; s discovery .
Charon is a moon of the dwarf planet Pluto .
Pictures showing Pluto and Charon as separate disks were taken for the first time by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 1990s .

: A lively introduction to probability theory for the beginner .
The mathematical theory of probability has its roots in attempts to analyze games of chance by Gerolamo Cardano in the sixteenth century , and by Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century -LRB- for example the `` problem of points &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
Although an individual coin toss or the roll of a die is random event , if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns , which can be studied and predicted .
The central objects of probability theory are random variables , stochastic processes , and events : mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or happen over time in an apparently random fashion .
: The first major treatise blending calculus with probability theory , originally in French : ThÃ orie Analytique des ProbabilitÃ s .
Two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem .
As a mathematical foundation for statistics , probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data .
Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with analysis of random phenomena .
: The modern measure-theoretic foundation of probability theory ; the original German version -LRB- Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitrechnung -RRB- appeared in 1933 .
Methods of probability theory also apply to description of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state , as in statistical mechanics .

The English Language Liturgical Consultation -LRB- ELLC -RRB- is an international ecumenical group whose primary purpose is to provide ecumenically accepted texts for those who use English in their liturgy .
The text is as follows :
The United Methodists commonly incorporate the Apostles &apos; Creed into their worship services .
I believe in the Holy Ghost ; The holy Catholick Church ; The Communion of Saints ; The Forgiveness of sins ; The Resurrection of the body , And the life everlasting .
This form of the Apostles &apos; Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in The United Methodist Book of Worship , and hence it is growing in popularity and use .
I believe in the Holy Spirit , : the holy catholic Church , : the communion of saints , : the forgiveness of sins , : the resurrection of the body , : and the life everlasting .
In 1988 it produced a translation of the Apostles &apos; Creed , distinguished among other things by its avoidance of the word `` his &apos; &apos; in relation to God .
The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the ecumenical version , which includes `` he descended to the dead . &apos; &apos;
It is also used by evangelical Protestant denominations such as Presbyterians , Methodists , Congregationalists and many Baptists .
Credo in Spiritum Sanctum , sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam , sanctorum communionem , remissionem peccatorum , carnis resurrectionem , vitam aeternam .
Many hypotheses exist concerning the date and nature of the origin of the Apostles &apos; Creed . Many suppose it comes from `` the Old Roman Symbol &apos; &apos; of the 1st or 2nd century and was influenced later by the Nicene Creed -LRB- 325 \ / 381 -RRB- .
Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem , Creatorem caeli et terrae . Et in Iesum Christum , Filium Eius unicum , Dominum nostrum , qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto , natus ex Maria Virgine , passus sub Pontio Pilato , crucifixus , mortuus , et sepultus , descendit ad Ã nferos , tertia die resurrexit a mortuis , ascendit ad caelos , sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis , inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos .
: On the third day he rose again ; : he ascended into heaven , : he is seated at the right hand of the Father , : and he will come to judge the living and the dead .
It is widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes , most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition , including the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church , Lutheranism , the Anglican Communion , and Western Orthodoxy .
In the Church of England there are currently two authorized forms of the creed : that of the Book of Common Prayer -LRB- 1662 -RRB- and that of Common Worship -LRB- 2000 -RRB- .
I believe in Jesus Christ , his only Son , our Lord , who was conceived by the Holy Spirit , born of the Virgin Mary , suffered under Pontius Pilate , was crucified , died , and was buried ; he descended into hell .
It is special because it does not have the line `` he descended into hell &apos; &apos; , but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version .
I believe in Jesus Christ , God &apos; s only Son , our Lord , : who was conceived by the Holy Spirit , : born of the Virgin Mary , : suffered under Pontius Pilate , : was crucified , died , and was buried ; : he descended to the dead .
I believe in God , the Father almighty , : creator of heaven and earth .
The Apostles &apos; Creed -LRB- Latin : Symbolum Apostolorum -RRB- , sometimes titled Symbol of the Apostles , is an early statement of Christian belief , a creed or `` symbol . &apos; &apos;
On the third day he rose again ; he ascended into heaven , he is seated at the right hand of the Father , and he will come to judge the living and the dead .
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit , born of the Virgin Mary , suffered under Pontius Pilate , was crucified , dead , and buried ; the third day he rose from the dead ; he ascended into heaven , and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty ; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead .
This makes it acceptable to many Arians and Unitarians .
The United Methodist Hymnal also contains -LRB- at # 882 -RRB- what it terms the `` Ecumenical Version &apos; &apos; of this creed -- a version which is identical to that found in the Episcopal Church &apos; s current Book of Common Prayer .

There are only two covariant Maxwell Equations , because the covariant field vector includes the electrical and the magnetical field .
Also , the permittivity is the permittivity of free space Î 0 . So , in free space , the equation is :
This means that the magnetic field lines must be closed loops . Another way of saying this is that the field lines can not start from somewhere .
The second equation say the same thing as the other two equations , the homogeneous equations : Faraday &apos; s law of induction and the absence of magnetic monopoles .
The first tensor equation says the same thing as the two inhomogeneous Maxwell &apos; s equations : Gauss &apos; law and Ampere &apos; s law with Maxwell &apos; s correction .
In free space , the permeability Î 1 \ / 4 is the permeability of free space , Î 1 \ / 4 0 , which is exactly 4 Ï Ã -- 10-7 W \ / A Â m , by definition . Also , the permittivity is the permittivity of free space Î 0 .

Some phrases might have been changed or inserted -LRB- or duplicated in later paragraphs -RRB- , and with even just a few `` bad-apple &apos; &apos; changes , an article can seem chaotic or trashy .
Some of the most severe blanking , in recent articles , has involved removing the related-illness text in some medical articles , perhaps because that text contained `` too many technical medical terms &apos; &apos; that were actually , the formal names -LRB- and wiki-linked -RRB- for the related diseases .
So , the total number of individual people , who edit Wikipedia , is less than .
In early 2010 , Wikipedia was growing at the rate of over 1,040 new articles , every day -LRB- see : : en : WP : Modelling Wikipedia extended growth -RRB- , beyond the sub-standard articles deleted every day .
However , after a few years , the coverage of many subjects tends to broaden , so now , there are related subarticles , such as `` Scarlett O &apos;Hara &apos; &apos; or `` Rhett Butler &apos; &apos; -LRB- or other characters in Margaret Mitchell &apos; s 1936 novel -RRB- .
However , oftentimes , a `` 2-year expansion &apos; &apos; is made by the original author , almost doubling the size of an article .
Because of the haphazard interest in subjects , some famous book , such as Gone with the Wind , might go 7 years with only a hollow article about the book , while a particular comic book might be described in numerous articles , detailing each volume \ / issue published in the set of comics .
A full article , possibly expanded by a nurse or medical student , was hacked to become a partial stub , removing all the related information typically found in a medical encyclopedia : a real hatchet job , but not caught until weeks \ / months later .
Overall , Wikipedia users are divided into 2 groups of editors : the registered users , and the unregistered IP addresses .
Because there are tens of millions of notable subjects in the world , each person can write new articles each week , without always needing to expand some other , older article .
The fundamental problem with justifying deletion , such as by claiming , is that very few Wikipedia policies actually condone such deletions .
Small groups of editors often band together in Wikiprojects , to edit articles that share a common theme or topic .
What seemed to be a reasonable format limitation , years ago , might no longer apply .
Each Wikiproject develops its own rules , and many such groups have struggled to keep going , due to the limited time that the various volunteers can spend in editing so many articles .
For those reasons , some Wikipedia articles may seem quite bizarre , and several so-called `` official &apos; &apos; guidelines are still demanding peculiar rules , years later , with some rules so wiki-spastic they have never been considered in any other multi-user site .
The remaining bulk of Wikipedia contains random articles , added as each subject arises .
Hence , articles should be fixed only as time permits , not in a frantic rush to reach encyclopedic `` perfection &apos; &apos; .
Only a fraction of the total articles have been significantly expanded by multiple people .
Such long-term , multi-hacking of articles is known as `` wiki-rot &apos; &apos; .
Several portions of Wikipedia were created as articles copied from traditional encyclopedias , such as from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica , or generated from a long list of town population-data , but those articles now represent , at most , maybe 10 % of the current article base .
However , in general , it is a good idea to re-visit older articles , every few months , to check for quality problems that have been added .
But some statistics have estimated the active editors , during a month , to be less than 300,000 people actively editing articles .
However , many of the registered users sometimes edit articles without logging in with their username , instead , just using their IP address .
When detecting excessive text removals , feel free to revert any self-righteous deletions , and try to restore text as intended by the writers , but always mindful of discussions on the talk-page .
The problem is so severe that there is even a policy , &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; -LRB- WP : IAR -RRB- , because many rules might no longer reflect what normal people would willingly follow .
However , for the majority of articles , Wikipedia has become a vast `` pot-luck dinner &apos; &apos; .
One of the most difficult aspects , for many people to realize , is that Wikipedia is basically `` invented out of thin air &apos; &apos; and people have retro-forced some rules with little regard to actually working with other people .
Even the most crucial problems , such as avoiding potentially private , or libelous , text about a living person , should be handled by mending or modifying , not deleting , the inserted text , per policy since 2007 , as noted in essay .
After several months , many articles tend to be hacked or adjusted , multiple times , in ways contrary to the original writing style , or in ways that introduce many errors .
The number of registered users , with login names , is -LRB- roughly million people -RRB- , with a similar number of unregistered users .

-LRB- -LRB- # Notes -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- The articles are , mostly , a somewhat random collection of information that many people thought to be worthy of interest .
As with a pot-luck dinner , each individual brings something to the table , so most articles tend to be a one-person contribution .
Many articles about sports teams have been expanded into entire article-sets , with separate articles for each member of the team or coaching staff , or for each play-off season .
Many articles are written by each person acting alone , with each article later modified slightly by perhaps 10 other people , but essentially the viewpoint of one person .
It is not critical to make instant improvements , because many readers have come to expect rampant vandalism in numerous articles .
Expect such rampant deletions and be prepared to reverse them .
Typically , deletion of whole sections , of an article , is considered to be `` blanking &apos; &apos; -LRB- as a form of vandalism -RRB- .
The book \ / movie The Da Vinci Code was expanded into more than 12 articles about that single subject .
In prior years , many people set their personal Wikipedia-watchlists to receive update-alerts when articles had been hacked or changed , so the updates could be fixed or adjusted soon after .
However , such blanking is done , often , and sometimes justified as removing `` POV &apos; &apos; -LRB- slanted point-of-view -RRB- text from the article , while effectively axing entire sections .
After an article has stayed a while -LRB- after several months -RRB- , it might be radically expanded by another person , adding perhaps 30 % -50 % more information .

The resulting high CPU overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for TCQ .
This is preferable since the drive has the most knowledge of its performance characteristics , and is able to take rotational position into account .
The appropriate device driver must be loaded into the operating system to enable NCQ on the host bus adapter .
For NCQ to be enabled , it must be supported and enabled in the SATA host bus adapter and in the hard drive itself .
In fact , newer mainstream Linux kernels support AHCI natively .
ATA &apos; s attempt at integrating TCQ was constrained by the requirement that ATA host bus adapters use ISA bus device protocols to interact with the operating system .
Unfortunately , Windows XP requires the installation of a vendor-specific driver even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter .
This can reduce the amount of unnecessary drive head movement and resulting in better performance -LRB- and slightly decreased wear of the drive -RRB- for workloads where multiple read \ / write requests are outstanding at the same time . This situation most often occurs in server-type applications .
NCQ and PATA TCQ have a maximum queue length of 32 in-flight commands -LRB- 31 in practice -RRB- , while SCSI TCQ has a maximum queue length of 264 in-flight commands .
Native Command Queuing -LRB- NCQ -RRB- is a technology designed to increase performance of SATA hard disks on computers . It can do this under certain situations by allowing the individual hard disk to internally optimize the order in which it executes the read and write requests it received .
Many newer chipsets support the Advanced Host Controller Interface -LRB- AHCI -RRB- , which should allow a generic driver supplied by the operating system to control them and enable NCQ .
Native Command Queuing was preceded by Parallel ATA &apos; s version of Tagged Command Queuing -LRB- TCQ -RRB- .

This may improve performance slightly in a system used by a single user , but really comes into its own in a system with many users , making requests all over the disk surface .
A modern elevator processes the requests to stop at floors in the logical order 2 , 4 , and 5 , without unnecessary travel .
The queue is constantly receiving new requests and fulfilling and removing existing requests , and re-ordering the queue according to the current pending read \ / write requests and the changing position of the head .
In order to boost performance , it had to decide the order of the requests based on its own , possibly incorrect , idea of what the hard drive was doing .
With TCQ , the drive can make its own decisions about how to order the requests -LRB- and in turn relieve the operating system from having to do so -RRB- .
Tagged Command Queueing -LRB- TCQ -RRB- is a technology that allows to send multiple read and write requests to a hard drive simultaneously .
Before TCQ , an operating system was only able to send one request at a time .
If the buttons for floors 5 , 2 , and 4 are pressed in that order with the elevator starting on floor 1 , an old elevator would go to the floors in the order requested .
The exact reordering algorithm may depend upon the controller and the drive itself , but the host computer simply makes requests as needed , leaving the controller to handle the details .
ATA TCQ is not identical in function to the more efficient Native Command Queuing -LRB- NCQ -RRB- used by SATA drives .
SCSI TCQ does not suffer from the same limitations as ATA TCQ .
The result is that TCQ can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly .
For efficiency the sectors should be serviced in order of proximity to the current head position , rather than in the order received .
This queuing mechanism is sometimes referred to as `` elevator seeking &apos; &apos; , as the image of a modern elevator in a building servicing multiple calls and processing them to minimize travel illustrates the idea well .
Non-queueing disk drives service the requests in the order received , like an old elevator ; queueing drives service requests in the most efficient order .

Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece ; however , in 486 BC , his Egyptian subjects revolted , indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition .
The Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11 .
Although historically inaccurate , the legend of a Greek messenger running to Athens with news of the victory became the inspiration for this athletic event , introduced at the 1896 Athens Olympics , and originally run between Marathon and Athens .
After Darius died , his son Xerxes I re-started the preparations for a second invasion of Greece , which finally began in 480 BC .
Stalemate ensued for five days , before the Athenians -LRB- for reasons that are not completely clear -RRB- decided to attack the Persians .
The Battle of Marathon is perhaps now more famous as the inspiration for the Marathon race .
In 490 BC , he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean , to subjugate the Cyclades , and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria .
The Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies on the flanks , before turning inwards to surround the Persian center , which had been more successful against the thin Greek center .
The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece , and the Persian force retreated to Asia .
p71 The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships , and managed to capture seven , though most were able to launch .
For instance , John Stuart Mill famously suggested that `` the Battle of Marathon , even as an event in British history , is more important than the Battle of Hastings &apos; &apos; .
Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade , Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece .
Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians , the hoplites proved devastatingly effective against the more lightly armed Persian infantry , routing the wings before turning in on the center of the Persian line .
In response to this raid , Darius swore to have revenge on Athens and Eretria .
The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis , but were then forced to retreat with heavy losses .
All this was evidently much to the surprise of the Persians ; Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the Persian army , protected for the most part by their armor , the Greek line finally collided with the enemy army .
Some , unaware of the local terrain , ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned .
It was fought between the citizens of Athens , aided by Plataea , and a Persian force .
The battle ended when the Persian center then broke in panic towards their ships , pursued by the Greeks .
Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization , which has been enduringly influential in western society , the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in European history .
The Battle of Marathon took place in 490 BC , during the first Persian invasion of Greece .
Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean , the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria .
The Persian force then sailed for Attica , landing in the bay near the town of Marathon .
Then Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule .
The Athenians had honed their style of fighting in combat with other phalanxes , wooden shields smashing against wooden shields , iron spear tips clattering against breastplates of bronze ... in those first terrible seconds of collision , there was nothing but a pulverizing crash of metal into flesh and bone ; then the rolling of the Athenian tide over men wearing , at most , quilted jerkins for protection , and armed , perhaps , with nothing more than bows or slings .
Holland provides an evocative description : `` The enemy directly in their path ... realized to their horror that -LRB- the Athenians -RRB- , far from providing the easy pickings for their bowmen , as they had first imagined , were not going to be halted ... The impact was devastating .
The Athenians , joined by a small force from Plataea , marched to Marathon , and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon .
The battle was the result of the first attempt by Persia , under King Darius I , to subjugate Greece .
Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield , and it is unknown how many more perished in the swamps .
The hoplites &apos; ash spears , rather than shivering ... could instead stab and stab again , and those of the enemy who avoided their fearful jabbing might easily be crushed to death beneath the sheer weight of the advancing men of bronze . &apos; &apos;
The Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars , showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten ; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at Marathon .

The keys , in practice , represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private secure connection .
Symmetric-key algorithms can be divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers .
Other terms for symmetric-key encryption are secret-key , single-key , shared-key , one-key and eventually private-key encryption .
Examples of popular symmetric cyphers include Twofish , Serpent , AES -LRB- aka Rijndael -RRB- , Blowfish , CAST5 , RC4 , TDES , and IDEA .
Symmetric ciphers have historically been susceptible to known-plaintext attacks , chosen plaintext attacks , differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis .
The encryption key is simply related to the decryption key , in that they may be identical or there is a simple relation between the two keys .
Blocks of 64 bits have been commonly used ; though modern ciphers like the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm uses 128-bit blocks .
Stream ciphers encrypt the bits of the message as a stream of bits one at a time , and block ciphers take a number of bits and encrypt them as a single unit .
Symmetric-key algorithms are a class of algorithms for cryptography that use trivially related , often identical , cryptographic keys for both decryption and encryption .

The replication of functional units was only made possible when the integrated circuit -LRB- some times called `` die &apos; &apos; -RRB- area of a single-issue processor no longer stretched the limits of what could be reliably manufactured .
Since microarchitecture design decisions directly affect what goes into a system , attention must be paid to such issues as :
This is achieved by replicating the state hardware -LRB- such as the register file and program counter -RRB- for each active thread .
On average , every fifth instruction executed is a branch , so that &apos; s a high amount of stalling .
The addition of caches reduces the frequency or duration of stalls due to waiting for data to be fetched from the main memory hierarchy , but does not get rid of these stalls entirely .
A further enhancement is simultaneous multithreading .
The pipeline includes several different stages which are fundamental in microarchitecture designs .
As semiconductor manufacturing progressed , more and more of these techniques could be implemented on a single semiconductor chip .
This technique is used in most modern microprocessors , microcontrollers , and DSPs .
The difference is that a multithreaded CPU can do a thread switch in one CPU cycle instead of the hundreds or thousands of CPU cycles a context switch normally requires .
For large corporations , large scale -LRB- 16-256 -RRB- multiprocessors are common .
Even with all of the added complexity and gates needed to support the concepts outlined above , improvements in semiconductor manufacturing soon allowed even more logic gates to be used .
Improvements in chip manufacturing allowed more circuitry to be placed on the same chip , and designers started looking for ways to use it .
This trend is sometimes known as `` throughput computing &apos; &apos; .
Though this does not speed up a particular program \ / thread , it increases the overall system throughput by reducing the time the CPU is idle .
This idea originated in the mainframe market where online transaction processing emphasized not just the execution speed of one transaction , but the capacity to deal with big numbers of transactions at the same time .
The size , latency , throughput and connectivity of memories within the system are also microarchitectural decisions .
Generally speaking , more cache means more speed .
Early processor designs performed all of the steps above on one instruction before moving onto the next .
The pipelined datapath is the most commonly used datapath design in microarchitecture today .
Step -LRB- 2 -RRB- often introduces a delay -LRB- in CPU terms often called a `` stall &apos; &apos; -RRB- while the data arrives over the computer bus .
Previously , it did n &apos;t make much sense to build a pipeline that could run faster than the access latency of off-chip cash memory .
The design of pipelines is one of the central microarchitectural tasks .
A big amount of research has been put into designs that avoid these delays as much as possible .
Some designs , such as UltraSPARC T1 used a simpler -LRB- scalar , in-order -RRB- designs in order to fit more processors on one piece of silicon .
The instruction issue logic grows in complexity by reading in a huge list of instructions from memory and handing them off to the different execution units that are idle at that point .
Speculative execution is a further enhancement in which the code along the predicted path is executed before it is known whether the branch should be taken or not .
The instruction set architecture is near to the programming model of a processor as seen by an assembly language programmer or compiler writer , which includes the execution model , processor registers , address and data formats etc . .
Architectures that are dealing with data parallelism include SIMD and Vectors .
In early designs a cache miss would force the cache controller to stall the processor and wait .
Pipeline stalls and flushes due to branches are the two main things preventing achieving higher performance through instruction level parallelism .
Although any one instruction takes just as long to complete -LRB- there are still four steps -RRB- the CPU as a whole `` retires &apos; &apos; instructions much faster and can be run at a much higher clock speed .
System-level design decisions such as whether or not to include peripherals , such as memory controllers , can be considered part of the microarchitectural design process .
The CPU includes a cache controller which automates reading and writing from the cache , if the data is already in the cache it simply `` appears , &apos; &apos; whereas if it is not the processor is `` stalled &apos; &apos; while the cache controller reads it in .
In the outline above the processor processes parts of a single instruction at a time .
One technique of how this parallelism is achieved is through multiprocessing systems , computer systems with multiple CPUs .
For these reasons , newer generations of computers have started to utilize higher levels of parallelism that exist outside of a single program or program thread .
Over the years , a central design goal was to execute more instructions in parallel , thus increasing the effective execution speed of a program .
This technique allows superscalar CPUs to execute instructions from different programs \ / threads simultaneously in the same cycle .
Cache is a very fast memory , memory that can be accessed in a few cycles as compared to what is needed to talk to main memory .
These units perform the operations or calculations of the processor .
This would allow up to four instructions to be `` in flight &apos; &apos; at one time , making the processor look four times as fast .
One of the most common ways was to add an ever-increasing amount of cache memory on-chip .
Of course there may be some other instruction in the program whose data is available in the cache at that point .
Register renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions .
Large portions of the processor circuitry were left idle at any one step ; for instance , the instruction decoding circuitry would be idle during execution and so on .
In the past such techniques could only be implemented on expensive mainframes or supercomputers due to the amount of circuitry needed for these techniques .
Advances in semiconductor technology reduced transistor size ; multicore CPUs have appeared where multiple CPUs are implemented on the same silicon chip .
Branch prediction is where the hardware makes educated guesses on whether a particular branch will be taken .
Even personal computers with multiple CPUs have appeared since the 1990s .
In the past this was reserved for high-end mainframes but now small scale -LRB- 2-8 -RRB- multiprocessors servers have become commonplace for the small business market .
Techniques such as branch prediction and speculative execution are used to reduce these branch penalties .
Unlike architectural design , where achieving a specific performance level is the main goal , microarchitectural design pays closer attention to other constraints .
The guess allows the hardware to prefetch instructions without waiting for the register read .
Execution units include arithmetic logic units -LRB- ALU -RRB- , floating point units -LRB- FPU -RRB- , load \ / store units , branch prediction , and SIMD .
Some of these stages include instruction fetch , instruction decode , execute , and write back .
Computer programs could be executed faster if multiple instructions were processed simultaneously .
The results are then collected and re-ordered at the end .
Out-of-order execution allows that ready instruction to be processed while an older instruction waits on the cache , then re-orders the results to make it appear that everything happened in the programmed order .
Conceptually , multithreading is equivalent to a context switch at the operating system level .
Caches and pipelines were a perfect match for each other .
Microarchitecture and instruction set architecture -LRB- ISA -RRB- together constitute the field of computer architecture .
The choice of the number of execution units , their latency and throughput is a central microarchitectural design task .
Additionally , the large transistor counts and high operating frequencies needed for the more advanced ILP techniques required power dissipation levels that could no longer be cheaply cooled .
Using on-chip cache memory instead , meant that a pipeline could run at the speed of the cache access latency , a much smaller length of time .
Initially used in-chips targeting embedded markets , where simpler and smaller CPUs would allow multiple instantiations to fit on one piece of silicon .
Due to the growing gap between CPU operating frequencies and DRAM access times , none of the techniques that enhance instruction-level parallelism -LRB- ILP -RRB- within one program could overcome the long stalls -LRB- delays -RRB- that occurred when data had to be fetched from main memory .
This includes decisions on the performance-level and connectivity of these peripherals .
In the same basic example , the processor would start to decode -LRB- step 1 -RRB- a new instruction while the last one was waiting for results .
The pipelined architecture allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution , much like an assembly line .
Execution units are also essential to microarchitecture .
These efforts introduced complicated logic and circuit structures .
The from time that the processor &apos; s instruction decoder has found that it has encountered a conditional branch instruction to the time that the deciding jumping register value can be read out , the pipeline might be stalled for several cycles .
By the late 1980s , superscalar designs started to enter the market place .
Pipelines improve performance by allowing a number of instructions to work their way through the processor at the same time .
Complicating this simple-looking series of steps is the fact that the memory hierarchy , which includes caching , main memory and non-volatile storage like hard disks , -LRB- where the program instructions and data reside -RRB- has always been slower than the processor itself .
Suppose we have to groups of instruction that will use the same register , one set of instruction is executed first to leave the register to the other set , but if the other set is assigned to a different similar register both sets of instructions can be executed in parallel .
This is what superscalar processors achieve , by replicating functional units such as ALUs .
By 2005 , semiconductor technology allowed dual high-end desktop CPUs CMP chips to be manufactured in volume .
One of the first , and most powerful , techniques to improve performance is the use of the instruction pipeline .
With transaction-based applications such as network routing and web-site serving greatly increasing in the last decade , the computer industry has re-emphasized capacity and throughput issues .
RISC designs started adding cache in the mid-to-late 1980s , often only 4 KB in total .
In modern designs it is common to find two load units , one store -LRB- many instructions have no results to store -RRB- , two or more integer math units , two or more floating point units , and often a SIMD unit of some sort .
Some architectures include other stages such as memory access .
This number grew over time , and typical CPUs now have about 512 KB , while more powerful CPUs come with 1 or 2 or even 4 , 6 , 8 or 12 MB , organized in multiple levels of a memory hierarchy .
Recently , another technique that has become more popular is multithreading .
In multithreading , when the processor has to fetch data from slow system memory , instead of stalling for the data to arrive , the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute .
What follows is a survey of micro-architectural techniques that are common in modern CPUs .
This allowed the operating frequencies of processors to increase at a much faster rate than that of off-chip memory .

It has been called the first rhythm-action game in retrospect .
Analysts suggest that the market for these types of peripheral rhythm games may be stagnant for three to five years after which they may resurge on new consoles or based on different distribution models such as a stronger focus on downloadable content .
As a result , analysts have lowered expectations for future music games ; projections for sales of DJ Hero , a spinoff of Guitar Hero published by Activision , have been reduced from 1.6 million units in the first quarter of sales in the United Sates to only 600,000 .
Industry pundits believe that as sales of music games requiring peripheral controllers lag , dance-based games , along with rising popularity of pop music , will continue to thrive for some time .
However , they are usually in the background , and the avatar is less important to the player than it is to spectators .
Activision scaled back its 2010 Guitar Hero release schedule to just two full games , reducing the number of SKUs from 25 in 2009 to 10 in 2010 .
The weakening market for rhythm video games has created fallout effects impacting both game developers and distributors .
In addition to rhythm , some games may challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button .
Analysts for the video game market considered 2009 to be critical to further success of the genre .
In 1997 , Konami &apos; s Beatmania started popularity for rhythm games in Japan .
The success of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises widened the console video game market and its demographics , with the popularity of the music game driving increased sales of consoles .
By 2008 , rhythm games were considered to be one of the most popular video game genres , behind other action games .
The Guitar Hero franchise followed suit with Guitar Hero World Tour , developed by Neversoft rather than Harmonix .
The game was inspired by GuitarFreaks , but while that game had used Japanese pop music , Guitar Hero featured Western rock music .
Games such as Dance Central , Michael Jackson : The Game , and Child of Eden are all games based on the new motion sensing technology aimed to encourage more engaging dance routines .
Sales of music games were down in the first half of the year , though part was attributed to fewer purchases of the instrument controllers which players had already purchased and could reuse for other games .
With the introduction of motion control to both the Xbox 360 -LRB- through Kinect -RRB- and the PlayStation 3 -LRB- through PlayStation Move -RRB- in 2010 and 2011 , along with existing Wii motion control , some analysts believed the rhythm market would resurges through a new wave of dance-based video games and band-based ones that use platform-agnostic controllers to replicate real-life actions .
One of those successes , GuitarFreaks , featured a guitar-shaped controller .
The game was highly successful not only in Japan but globally , unlike games such as GuitarFreaks , DrumMania and Beatmania -LRB- though Beatmania had some success in Europe -RRB- .
These courses were generated in a way that depended on the background music and players could load their own music to play along .
The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for different controllers .
Though signs of the impact of the late-2000s recession on the video game markets were considered a factor in lower sales , it was also taken as a sign of the waning popularity of the titles , now considered to be saturating the market .
1998 &apos; s Pop ` n Music , a game similar to Beatmania , featuring multiple colorful buttons was also successful .
The game required players to press buttons corresponding to the order they appeared on-screen ; this basic mechanic would form the core of future rhythm games .
Rhythm game , or rhythm action , is a subgenre of action game that challenges a player &apos; s sense of rhythm , and includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and other music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero .
The game was inspired by similar , earlier Japanese games , but Harmonix added rock music aimed at a Western audience .
The company &apos; s music division , Bemani , released many music games over the next several years .
Players take turns repeating increasingly complicated sequences of button presses and the game implemented the `` call and response &apos; &apos; mechanic used by later music video games .
During the third quarter of 2010 , Viacom began seeking a buyer for Harmonix , recognizing they did not have the efficiency and capacity to deal with the cost of maintaining a video game developer compared with dedicated video game publishers .
Further contributing to the decline is the lack of innovation in the genre , as such games have not changed their basic play model over their last several games , leading to consumers becoming less likely to buy additional titles .
The success of the game revived the genre and two hugely successful franchises were born in Guitar Hero and the later Rock Band .
The game was a surprise hit , inspiring Konami &apos; s Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game , and to then begin experimenting with other rhythm games over the next few years .
The most successful of these was dance mat game Dance Dance Revolution , which was also the only one to achieve large-scale success outside of Japan .
Unlike most other games in the genre , the game also featured a completely original soundtrack and a good plot .
In 2001 , Taiko no Tatsujin combined traditional Japanese drums with contemporary pop music , and became highly successful in Japanese arcades .
The game allowed the player to control multiple instruments and gave a feeling of more creative control .
By the end of 2010 , the rhythm market , initially propped by game bundles with instrument controllers , was considered `` well past its prime &apos; &apos; and has shifted towards downloadable content and potential integration with motion control systems .
While it was praised for its unique style and timeless artistry , its simple vector graphics proved difficult to market and the game was never released in North America .
Rhythm game , or rhythm action , is a type of music-themed action video games .
Gitaroo Man featured a guitar-playing protagonist , 4 years before the release of Guitar Hero , though the game employed a conventional rather than guitar-shaped controller .
Both the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises expanded in this year with new games on other gaming platforms including handheld gaming devices and mobile phones and with titles targeted towards specific genres or demographics , such as Band Hero for pop music and Lego Rock Band for younger players .
The genre also includes games that measure both rhythm and pitch , in order to test a player &apos; s singing ability .
Dance Dance Revolution , released in 1998 , was a rhythm game in which players danced on pressure sensitive pads in time with on-screen commands .
Bemani &apos; s Samba de Amigo , released in 1999 and on Dreamcast in 2000 , featured maraca-shaped , motion sensor controllers .
Artists whose works have been featured in the games have also benefited from royalties and increased publicity , in turn generating further sales of their work .
The success of both expanded the console video game market and its demographics .
The game was well-reviewed , but its abstract style did not allow the player to give a `` performance &apos; &apos; as in other games and thus proved difficult to market .
Citing the downturn in rhythm games , Activision shuttered their Guitar Hero division in February 2011 .
These include a variety of controllers which look like musical instruments , such as guitars , drums , or maracas .
While songs can be sight read without having performed them before , players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings .
Additional songs could be purchased on the internet and added to Guitar Hero and Rock Band games .
In some rhythm games , the screen will display an avatar who performs in response to the player &apos; s button-presses .
Harmonix , a company formed from a computer music group at MIT in 1995 , released Frequency in 2001 .
The game revived the rhythm genre which by this time had begun to get boring , flooded with Dance Dance Revolution sequels and imitators .
Similarly , DrumMania from 1999 used a drum kit controller and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions , several years before the concept appeared in Rock Band .
The game had several sequels , with the franchise earning more than $ 1 billion in sales ; the third game was the best-selling game in North America in 2007 .
While the franchise continues to receive new arcade versions in Japan , it was never strongly marketed outside of the country , allowing Harmonix to capitalize on the formula several years later with the Western-targeted Guitar Hero .
The genre has been traced back to the electronic game Simon , invented by Howard Morrison and Ralph Baer -LRB- the latter also invented the Magnavox Odyssey -RRB- in 1978 .
Activision has also closed some of its in-house developers , including RedOctane , Neversoft &apos; s Guitar Hero division , and Underground Development , bringing the remaining employees and assets under their own control .
The later PaRappa the Rapper has also been credited as the first rhythm game , as well as one of the first music games in general .
The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper was the first influential rhythm game .
However , because there were so many spin-offs from the core titles in 2009 , there was a nearly 50 % drop in sales for music games , causing them to scale-back plans for further expansion in 2010 .
However , though analysis had expected that United States sales of Guitar Hero 5 and The Beatles : Rock Band to be high , close to or exceeding one million units each in the first month of their release , the resulting sales numbers were lower by nearly half of the projections .
Released the same year , Enix &apos; s Bust a Groove revolved around similar dancing themes to Dance Dance Revolution but employed a more conventional input method .
Gitaroo Mans creator , Keiichi Yano , further created Osu !
Traditional control pads may also be used .
These games mostly focus either on dancing or simulating the playing of musical instruments .
Konami &apos; s Beatmania , released in Japanese arcades in 1997 , was a dj-themed rhythm game which featured buttons laid out like a keyboard along with a rubber pad that looked like a record .
The game made use of `` social gaming &apos; &apos; , allowing two player gameplay and providing a spectacle for onlookers .
Publishers and distributors have recognized that in 2010 , most consumers likely have one or more sets of instrument controller hardware at their homes , and that further sales would be primarily driven by software sales and additional content .
Dance Aerobics was released in 1987 , and allowed players to create music by stepping on Nintendo &apos; s Power Pad peripheral .
Doing so will cause the game &apos; s protagonist or avatar to dance or play their instrument correctly , thus achieving a greater score .
Donkey Konga , developed by Namco for Nintendo and released in 2003 -LRB- 2004 in North America -RRB- achieved widespread success due to its use of Nintendo &apos; s Donkey Kong franchise .
In this game , players had to maneuver the protagonist through an obstacle course by pressing buttons at the correct time .
Other rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says , where the player must watch , remember , and repeat complex sequences of button-presses .

The MBR contains GRUB stage 1 .
This may be yet another boot manager , such as the Microsoft boot menu , allowing further selection of non-Multiboot operating systems .
GNU GRUB -LRB- `` GRUB &apos; &apos; for short -RRB- is a boot loader package from the GNU Project .
When a computer is turned on , the computer &apos; s BIOS finds the primary bootable device -LRB- usually the computer &apos; s hard disk -RRB- and loads the initial bootstrap program from the master boot record -LRB- MBR -RRB- , the first 512 bytes of the hard disk , and then transfers control to this code .
In this case , copies of the other system &apos; s boot programs have been saved by GRUB ; instead of a kernel , the other system is loaded as though it had been started from the MBR .
Stage 1.5 loads Stage 2 .
Once boot options have been selected , GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control on to the kernel , which then continues to start itself .
This normally takes the form of a graphical menu , although if this is not available or the user wishes further control , GRUB has its own command prompt , where the user can manually specify the boot parameters .
Stage 1 can either load Stage 2 directly , or it can load stage 1.5 : GRUB Stage 1.5 is located in the first 30 kilobytes of hard disk immediately following the MBR .
GRUB is the main example of the Multiboot Specification , which allows a user to have more than one operating systems on their computer at once , and to choose which one to run when the computer starts . GRUB can be used to select from different kernel images available on a particular operating system &apos; s partitions , as well as to pass boot-time parameters to such kernels .
GRUB can also be set to automatically load a particular kernel after a timeout period .
At this stage GRUB can also pass control of the boot process to another loader , using chain loading , for operating systems such as Windows that do not support the Multiboot standard .
When GRUB Stage 2 receives control , it presents an interface to the user in order to select which operating system to boot .

is a 1995 song written by Bryan Adams , Michael Kamen and Robert John `` Mutt &apos; &apos; Lange for the film Don Juan DeMarco .
The melody is used as a musical motif throughout the film , and the song is featured three times in the movie , twice performed by other artists in Spanish , and finally performed by Adams himself during the closing credits .
Various women &apos; s groups contacted Adams when the song became popular , which led to his publishing a series of books of photos , with all proceeds going to breast cancer research .
The Adams version of the song , which features flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia , is featured on the soundtrack album and also on the album 18 Til I Die .

Saint-Christophe - Ã - Berry is a commune .
The story &apos; s final scene , however , is a result of the narrator &apos; s feelings of guilt .
His drive to convince , however , is self-destructive because he fully admits he is guilty of murder .
The eye may also represent secrecy , again playing on the ambiguous lack of detail about the man or the narrator .
Despite his best efforts at defending himself , the narrator &apos; s `` over acuteness of the senses , &apos; &apos; which help him hear the heart beating in the floorboards , is what convinces the reader that he is truly mad .
Only when the eye is finally found open on the final night , penetrating the veil of secrecy , that the murder is carried out .
The narrator first admits to hearing death watches in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep .
The narrator chops up the body , and hides the pieces under the floorboards . The narrator then cleans the place up to hide all signs of the crime .
Despite this , however , he says the idea of murder , `` haunted me day and night . &apos; &apos;
The murder of the eye , then , is a removal of conscience .
One of the driving forces in this opening and throughout the story is not the narrator &apos; s insistence upon his innocence but on his sanity .
It is unclear , however , if the narrator actually has very acute senses or if he is merely imagining things .
The relationship between the old man and the narrator is ambiguous , as is their names , their occupations , or where they live .
One variety of death watch beetles raps its head against surfaces , presumably as part of a mating ritual , while others emit a ticking sound .
The first word of the story , `` True !
Poe was likely paid only $ 10 .
Whoever it is , it sparks the narrator &apos; s need to explain himself in great detail .
If his condition is believed to be true , what he hears at the end of the story may not be the old man &apos; s heart but death watch beetles .
The story was first published in James Russell Lowell &apos; s The Pioneer in January 1843 .
His denial of insanity is based on his systemic actions and precision - a rational explanation for irrational behavior -LRB- murder -RRB- .
According to superstition , death watches are a sign of impending death .
`` The Tell-Tale Heart &apos; &apos; is one of Poe &apos; s most famous short stories , and it is widely considered a classic of the Gothic fiction genre .
`` The Tell-Tale Heart &apos; &apos; was first published in the Boston-based magazine The Pioneer in January 1843 , edited by James Russell Lowell .
It is speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden , judge , newspaper reporter , doctor or psychiatrist .
The narrator , however , begins to hear a faint noise .
Readers during Poe &apos; s time would have been especially interested amidst the controversy over the insanity defense in the 1840s .
Former poet laureate Richard Wilbur has suggested that the tale is an allegorical representation of Poe &apos; s poem `` To Science . &apos; &apos;
When the narrator reports that the police -LRB- whether a delusion or real is unclear -RRB- respond to a call placed by a neighbor who heard a distressful scream , the narrator invites them to look around , confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder . They sit around the old man &apos; s room , right on top of the very hiding place of the dead body , yet suspect nothing .
In fact , that ambiguity adds to the tale as an ironic counter to the strict attention to detail in the plot .
In that case , the `` vulture &apos; &apos; eye of the old man is symbolizing parental surveillance and possibly the paternal principles of right and wrong .
The poem shows the struggle between imagination and science .
The narrator may be a servant of the old man &apos; s or , as is more often assumed , his son .
The opening is an in-progress conversation between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way .
It was slightly revised when republished in the August 23 , 1845 edition of the Broadway Journal .
This rationality , however , is undermined by his lack of motivation -LRB- `` Object there was none .
In `` The Tell-Tale Heart , &apos; &apos; the old man represents the scientific rational mind while the narrator is the imaginative .
`` The Tell-Tale Heart &apos; &apos; starts in medias res , in the middle of an event .
As the noise grows louder , the narrator hallucinates that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards .
Shocked by the constant beating of the heart and a feeling that the officers must be aware of the heartbeats , the narrator loses control and confesses to killing the old man and tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the body .
The narrator is taking care of an old man with a clouded , vulture-like eye .
It was reprinted multiple times during Poe &apos; s lifetime .
Like many characters in the Gothic tradition , his nerves dictate his true nature .
Passion there was none . &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
This paranoia increases as the officers seem to pay no attention to the sound , which is loud enough for the narrator to admit to having heard .
In the indigenous language , people who were taking part in the Vailala Madness called it iki haveve , or `` belly-don &apos; t know , &apos; &apos; which was another way of saying `` dizziness . &apos; &apos;
The Vailala Madness was a religious movement . It was active between 1919 and 1922 .
The Vailala Madness got its name from the behavior of people who took part in it . This behavior included glossolalia -LRB- or `` speaking in tongues &apos; &apos; -RRB- , shaking , and signs of mental or emotional disturbances .
Like many other stegosaurians , it had plates all down its back and spikes on its tail .
The name derives from `` Huayang &apos; &apos; , an alternate name for Sichuan province .
Like Stegosaurus , however , it bore two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of its tail .
Its skull was broader and had premaxillary teeth in the front of its mouth .
Huayangosaurus was one of the smallest known stegosaurians , at just 4.5 meters in length .
Thus they would have been much less effective heat regulators , one of the postulated functions of plates .
The type species is H. taibaii .
These plates rose vertically along its arched back .
Mounted skeletons of Huayangosaurus are on display at the Zigong Dinosaur Museum in Zigong and the Municipal Museum of Chongqing in Sichuan Province in China .
As it is the most basal stegosaurian , it is placed in within its own family Huayangosauridae .
In Huayangosaurus , the plates were more spike-like than in Stegosaurus .
All later stegosaurians lost these teeth .
Found in the Lower Shaximiao Formation , Huayangosaurus shared the local Middle Jurassic landscape with the sauropods Shunosaurus , Datousaurus , Omeisaurus and Protognathosaurus , the ornithopod Xiaosaurus and the carnivorous Gasosaurus .
Huayangosaurus remains from twelve individual animals were recovered from the Dashanpu Quarry near Zigong in Sichuan , and named by Dong , Tang , and Zhou in 1982 .
Its plates were smaller than those of Stegosaurus , with much less surface area .
Like its more famous relative , Stegosaurus , Huayangosaurus bore the distinctive double row of plates that characterize all the stegosaurians .
Like other stegosaurians , Huayangosaurus was a quadrupedal herbivore with a small skull and a spiked tail .
Two large spikes were above its hips , and may have been used for deterring an attack from above -LRB- considering as it was a fairly short in height compared to later stegosaurians -RRB- .
It is also morphologically distinct from later -LRB- stegosaurid -RRB- forms .
At only 4.5 metres long , it was also much smaller than its famous cousin .
Huayangosaurus is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of China .
It lived during the Bathonian to Callovian stages , around 165 million years ago , some 20 million years before its famous relative , Stegosaurus appeared in North America .
In 1866 the gubernia of AugustÃ w was named SuwaÅ ki Gubernia .
On May 2 , 1720 , by King August II let the city keep its rights , and the town was allowed to have one fair a week and four markets a year .
The town was named Sudauen and was made a part of the German Reich &apos; s East Prussia .
This led to another time of growth , with the number of people in the city rising from 16,780 in 1921 to almost 25,000 in 1935 .
Although the Polish language was still kept from use , Polish schools and a library were opened .
In 1917 , local branches of the Polska Organizacja Wojskowa were made .
After the war , SuwaÅ ki was still a capital of the powiat .
Also , production of wood , lumber , tar and iron ore was started .
In 1794 the area was taken by Prussia .
Almost all of the city &apos; s once 7,000-strong Jewish people were murdered in German concentration camps .
After the January Uprising of 1863 , a new a kind of government was made to join all of the Polish lands with Russia .
In 1826 new buildings were started by the state police .
Between 1806 and 1827 the number of people living in the town grew and reached 3,753 people living in 357 houses .
However , the making of the SuwaÅ ki Special Economic Zone and the place of the Russian and Lithuanian borders opened new chances for local trade .
In 1820 a new church was built and the following year the first synagogue opened .
After the Great War broke out , there were fights for the area .
The town was also given 18.03 square kilometres of forest that was to be made into land to grow crops on .
After the end of the Central Powers in November 1918 , the commander signed an agreement with the Temporary Council of the SuwaÅ ki Region and let the city back into Poland .
The town was cut into into 300 lots for future houses and its people were all given civil rights and did not have taxes for seven years .
Soon after the group of monks built its headquarters in Wigry , where a monastery and a church were built .
A coat of arms was given also , with Saint Roch and Saint Romuald on it .
Also , the clean city started to bring many tourists from all around the world to the city .
In 1796 the monastery in Wigry was closed and the ground that it was on was taken by the Prussian government .
The title of a powiat capital was gone for a short time , but it got the title back on January 16 , 1816 , when AugustÃ w Voivodeship was made and its police were slowly moved to SuwaÅ ki .
In the later times of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 the town was shortly captured by the Red Army .
In 1835 Tsar Nicholas I decided not to move the capital to AugustÃ w and the fate of SuwaÅ ki was sealed . Two years later the town became the capital of AugustÃ w Gubernia .
By the end of 18th century , SuwaÅ ki had 1,184 people and 216 houses .
In 1857 it had 11,273 people and in 1872 it had almost 20,000 people .
In 1829 a permanent post office was opened in SuwaÅ ki .
Soon the city became the fourth biggest town in the Kingdom of Poland .
The village was founded by monks , who were given the area around the future city in 1667 by the Grand Duke of Lithuania John II Casimir .
In 1847 the city council passed a law banning building of new wooden houses .
This time came to an end in 1975 , when SuwaÅ ki became the capital of a separate SuwaÅ ki Voivodeship .
In 1807 SuwaÅ ki was taken by the Duchy of Warsaw . After losing Napoleon Bonaparte and the Congress of Vienna , the area was taken by Poland .
czek paid for paving all the city &apos; s streets .
The new owners of the area started fast use and building of the forests and brought enough settlers to build new villages in the area .
The war ended because of the Entente in mid-September .
This led to the Sejny Uprising on August 23 , 1919 .
Many of them were Jewish .
Between 1840 and 1849 the main Catholic church was re-done Polish architects of the era , including Piotr Aigner , Antoni Corazzi and Henryk Marconi .
To make the city safe , the next day Polish soldiers entered SuwaÅ ki .
Although most of them were destroyed by the Gestapo , by 1942 the area had one of the strongest ZWZ and AK networks .
New factories needed workers they came from all over the world .
In the November Uprising of 1831 the people living in the town took part in the fights against Russia , but the city was taken by the Russian army on February 11 .
Also , in 1931 the new water works and a power plant were built .
However , on October 12 of the same year the Soviets quit and gave the area to the Germans , because of the Nazi-Soviet Alliance .
The number of people rose quickly and by the end of the 1970s there were over 36,000 people in the city .
The fights for the city lasted for a few days and killed almost 5,000 Soviet soldiers .
In 1835 a police station was finished , in 1844 a new town hall was finished , and Orthodox and Protestant churches .
Soon after the old city hall was destroyed and replaced with a new one , and General JÃ zef ZajÄ
Soon after a new marketplace was opened , and St. Peter &apos; s and Paul &apos; s hospital and a gymnasium .
During the Polish-Bolshevik War the city was captured by the Reds and after the Battle of Warsaw it was again given to the Lithuanians , but it was taken by the Polish Army with few losses soon after .
On October 23 , 1944 , the city was captured by the Soviet 3rd Belarusian Front .
There was a Polish-Lithuanian War and for several days limited fights were fought for the control over SuwaÅ ki , Sejny and other towns in that area .
In February 1919 the local people voted in the first elections to the Polish Sejm , but soon after the German commanders changed their minds and kept the Polish soldiers from the area and in May passed it to Lithuania to control .
However , the new Warsaw-Petersburg railroad passed by SuwaÅ ki and the town &apos; s growth ended .
By the end of July the Paris Peace Conference gave the city to Poland and the Lithuanians left the city , but some of the Polish lands were left on the Lithuanian side of the border while several Lithuanian villages were left on the Polish side of the border .
In 1915 , SuwaÅ ki was in German control .

The movie and also the movie about how it was made , The Balano and the Bark Canoes , shows the great struggle the indigenous people have made to keep their culture alive .
North east Arnhem Land is home to the Yolngu people , one of the largest indigenous groups in Australia . They have been able to keep their traditional indigenous culture .
Its administrative center is the town of Nhulunbuy , the fourth largest town in the Northern Territory .
The climate of Arnhem Land is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season .
Other paintings show axes , aircraft and ships .
Gove is the site of large bauxite mine with an alumina refinery .
The Malays and Macassans are believed to have had contact with the coastal Aboriginal groups and traded with them prior to European settlement of Australia .
In one rock shelter , hundreds of kilometres from Darwin , there is a painting the wharf at Darwin . It shows buildings and boats , the Europeans with their hats and pipes .
The Yolngu traded with the people of Makassar on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi .
The major towns are Jabiru on the Kakadu National Park border , Maningrida on the Liverpool River mouth , and Nhulunbuy -LRB- also known as Gove -RRB- in the far north east , on the Gove Peninsula .
Some of these show early visits by Europeans , sometimes in such detail that Martini-Henry rifles can be identified .
The 2006 movie Ten Canoes shows life in Arnhem land with a story that uses old Aboriginal stories . It was co-directed by one of the cast members .
The town of Gunbalanya , once called Oenpelli , in Western Arnhem Land is also famous for its bark painting .
It is in the north east corner of the territory and is about 500km from the territory capital Darwin .
The Aboriginal town of Yirrkala , just outside Nhulunbuy , is famous throughout the world . This is because of its its bark paintings , and its role in supporting the rights of Indigenous Australians .
Arnhem Land is famous for its Aboriginal rock art . Some of the best art can be found at Ubirr Rock , Injalak Hill , and in the Canon Hill area .
Arnhem Land goes from Port Roper on the Gulf of Carpentaria around the coast to the East Alligator River where it joins Kakadu National Park .
There is a painting , near the East Alligator River crossing , which shows a man with a gun and long pigtails down his back . This would be one of the Chinese workers brought to Darwin in the late 19th century .
It was named by Matthew Flinders after the Dutch ship Arnhem , which explored the coast in 1623 .
Arnhem Land became an Aboriginal Reserve in 1931 . It is still one of the largest Aboriginal Reserves in Australia .
It has an area of 97,000 kmÂ . This area includes Kakadu National Park .
One Yolngu stone arrangement , at Maccasans Beach near Yirrkala , shows the layout of the Macassan praus -LRB- ships -RRB- used for Trepang fishing .
It can get as cold as 15 degrees Celsius during nights in the dry season -LRB- April to September -RRB- . In the wet season -LRB- October to March -RRB- the days can be as hot as 33 degrees Celsius .
The Arnhem Land Region is one of the five regions of the Northern Territory of Australia .

Simply , data integrity is to make sure that data is `` consistent &apos; &apos; and `` correct &apos; &apos; .
Normally , a plain box table -LRB- with no `` class = &apos; &apos; -RRB- can be sized to any width up to `` 100 % &apos; &apos; without triggering a bottom scrollbar .
Note that a full-screen table of width = 101 % -LRB- or higher -RRB- , always triggers a bottom scrollbar , as expected , because 101 % -RRB- 100 -LRB- the full window width -RRB- .
A similar complex issue is the use of subheaders -LRB- &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; -RRB- inside a template , and determining which page contains that labeled section for editing , because appearing on a formatted page does not mean the heading exists inside that page , just inside the template displayed for that page .
When sized to 99 % or 100 % , those class = infobox formats have triggered a bottom scollbar -LRB- since 2008 , as of March 2009 -RRB- , appearing along the bottom of the window .
Normally , a plain table -LRB- with no `` class = &apos; &apos; -RRB- can be sized to any width up to `` 100 % &apos; &apos; without triggering a bottom scrollbar .
To avoid this situation , use :
The over-wide display has been caused by automatic extra-margin padding , as either : wider margin-right for class = wikitable , or wider margin-left for infoboxes .
One man &apos; s bug is another man &apos; s `` clever feature &apos; &apos; when the padding is added inside other tables , when formatting a table-within-a-table , etc .
A plain table -LRB- with no `` class = &apos; &apos; -RRB- can be resized up to 100 % without triggering a bottom scrollbar .
These problems of nesting are related to side-effects of recursion .
To avoid this situation , use : : : : class = wikitable style = `` width : 99 % ; margin-right : 0 &apos; &apos; The option for `` margin-right : 0 &apos; &apos; removes the right-side margin padding outside the box , rather than having a margin of 1em or 20px , or such .
The problem of over-wide tables occurs at the top level , when 100 % is the entire window , with no `` outside space &apos; &apos; to have padded .
: : : class = infobox style = `` width : 99 % ; margin-left : 0 &apos; &apos; The option for `` margin-left : 0 &apos; &apos; removes the left-side margin padding outside the infobox , rather than having a margin of 1em or 20px , or such .
The problem does not occur for other tables , without the keyword `` class = &apos; &apos; .
Instead , the table padding generated by the template is the same , whether viewing the template in stand-alone mode , or when transcluded into another page .
The issue of determining `` top-level tables &apos; &apos; is complicated by the use of templates : a table coded inside a template might seem to be a top-level table .
Perhaps the full-name of the essay could be : `` 98-percent table-width anomaly triggering bottom scroll-bars for top-level , CSS-class tables &apos; &apos; .
However , the various styles for `` class = infobox &apos; &apos; add an implicit left-side margin-left padding that fits okay up to 98 % width .
This issue is about the top-level tables on a page , not about tables -LRB- with width = 100 % -RRB- inside other tables .
However , if the template were invoked inside an outer table , then the result would generate nested tables .
As a final reminder : The scrollbar problem only occurs for top-level tables in CSS classes , such as class = wikitable or class = infobox .
Although some might wish to consider the default limitation of CSS-class tables -LRB- to width = 98 % -RRB- as a bug , when tables are nested within other tables , then a wikitable of 100 % - width will still add the same right-side padding as at width 50 % , 80 % or 98 % .
However , the styles for `` class = wikitable &apos; &apos; or `` wikitable sortable &apos; &apos; have added an implicit right-side margin-right padding that fits okay up to 98 % width .
This essay , WP : 98 percent table width anomaly addresses the issue of some tables -LRB- since 2008 , still in September 2010 -RRB- , with class = wikitable or class = infobox triggering the bottom scroll bar when width is set above 98 % .
Because of the relative viewpoint , the situation is termed an `` anomaly &apos; &apos; .
When sized to 99 % or 100 % , those class = wikitable formats have triggered a bottom scollbar -LRB- since 2008 , as of June 2009 -RRB- , appearing along the bottom of the window .

`` We want no part of it , the past &apos; &apos; , he wrote , `` we the young and strong Futurists ! &apos; &apos;
Nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern Western culture ; the emphasis on youth , speed , power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture .
It was largely an Italian phenomenon , though there were parallel movements in Russia , England and elsewhere .
The Futurists practiced in every medium of art , including painting , sculpture , ceramics , graphic design , industrial design , interior design , theater , film , fashion , textiles , literature , music , architecture and even gastronomy .
Echoes of Marinetti &apos; s thought , especially his `` dreamt-of metallization of the human body &apos; &apos; , are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture , and surface in manga \ / anime and the works of artists such as Shinya Tsukamoto , director of the `` Tetsuo &apos; &apos; -LRB- lit .
Publishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism , and the Futurists -LRB- usually led or prompted by Marinetti -RRB- wrote them on many topics , including painting , architecture , religion , clothing and cooking .
Futurism was , like science fiction , in part overtaken by ` the future &apos; .

This committed them to a `` universal dynamism &apos; &apos; , which was to be directly represented in painting .
`` Ironman &apos; &apos; -RRB- films ; Marinetti &apos; s legacy is also obvious in philosophical ingredients of transhumanism , especially in Europe .
After the Second World War , many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime .
The founder of Futurism and its most influential personality was the Italian writer Filippo Tommaso Marinetti .
Ridley Scott consciously evoked the designs of Sant ` Elia in Blade Runner .
They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation , praised originality , `` however daring , however violent &apos; &apos; , bore proudly `` the smear of madness &apos; &apos; , dismissed art critics as useless , rebelled against harmony and good taste , swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art , and gloried in science .
The Futurists &apos; association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work , especially in architecture .
Marinetti was soon joined by the painters Umberto Boccioni , Carlo CarrÃ , Giacomo Balla , Gino Severini and the composer Luigi Russolo .
Futurism was a modern art and social movement which originated in Italy in the early 20th century .
Futurism influenced many other twentieth century art movements , including Art Deco , Vorticism , Constructivism , Surrealism and Dadaism .
Marinetti launched the movement in his Futurist Manifesto , which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in La gazzetta dell &apos; Em ilia . This article was reprinted in the French daily newspaper Le Figaro on 20 February 1909 .
Marinetti was one of the first members of the National Fascist Party .
There are active Neo-Futurist troupes in Chicago , New York , and Montreal .
Like the Fascists , the Futurists were Italian nationalists , radicals , admirers of violence , and were opposed to parliamentary democracy .
Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old , especially political and artistic tradition .
The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic program . The Futurists attempted to create it in their subsequent Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting .
Futurism has produced several reactions , including the literary genre of cyberpunk â &apos; &apos; in which technology was often treated with a critical eye . Artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the Internet , such as Stelarc and Mariko Mori , produce work which is influenced by Futurist ideas .
The Futurists admired speed , technology , youth and violence , the car , the airplane and the industrial city , all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature , and they were passionate nationalists .
A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement began in 1988 with the creation of the Neo-Futurist style of theater in Chicago , which uses Futurism &apos; s focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theater .

The innate system is the evolutionarily older defense strategy . It is the main immune system found in plants , fungi , insects , and in primitive multicellular organisms .
The flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth .
This means the cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in a general way , but unlike the adaptive immune system , it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host .
The complement system is a biochemical cascade of the immune system that helps antibodies clear pathogens or mark them for destruction by other cells .
Inflammation is stimulated by chemical factors released by injured cells . It serves to establish a physical barrier against the spread of infection , and to promote healing of any damaged tissue after the clearance of pathogens .
Also , mucus traps infectious agents .
Chemical factors produced during inflammation attract phagocytes , especially neutrophils .
Innate immune systems provide immediate defense against infection , and are found in all plant and animal life .
In the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract , movement due to peristalsis or cilia helps remove infectious agents .

Elements of the complement cascade can be found in many non-mammalian species including plants , birds , fish and some species of invertebrates .

Examples include canines that live in packs , numerous insects , especially hymenoptera , humans , many birds , chimpanzees , and many other animals that display social behavior .

The day before his father and brothers were arrested in France , the duc de Chartres rushed to Tournai , near the French border , where his sister AdÃ laÃ de and Mme de Genlis had been living since Philippe Ã galitÃ had made them emigrate in November 1792 .
Louise Marie AdÃ laÃ de de Bourbon , -LRB- 13 March 1753 -- 23 June 1821 -RRB- , was the daughter of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon , Duke of PenthiÃ vre and of Maria Teresa d &apos;Este .
Later , the two were transferred to the prison of Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille , where they were soon joined by the duc de Montpensier who had been arrested while serving as an officer in the Army of the Alps .
Styled Mademoiselle d &apos;Ivoy initially and , as a young girl , until her marriage , Mademoiselle de PenthiÃ vre -LRB- derived from the duchy inherited by her father -RRB- .
Although Marie AdÃ laÃ de was much in love with her OrlÃ ans cousin , Louis XV warned PenthiÃ vre against such a marriage because of the reputation of the young Duke of Chartres as a womaniser .
On 5 April 1791 , Marie AdÃ laÃ de left her unfaithful husband and went to live with her father at the chÃ cents teau de Bizy in Normandy .
After legal battles which lasted until her death , the bulk of her inheritance was eventually recovered .
Marie AdÃ laÃ de , Rouzet and the OrlÃ ans exiled in Spain returned to France in 1814 at the time of the first Bourbon Restoration .
Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de was born on 13 March 1753 at the HÃ tel de Toulouse in Paris .
She died in her castle at Ivry-sur-Seine having suffered from breast cancer .
Rouzet accompanied them to the Spanish border and managed to secretly join them in Barcelona where he became her chancellor .
Siding with the radical group called The Mountain -LRB- La Montagne -RRB- , he was from the very beginning suspect in the eyes of the Girondists -LRB- Girondins -RRB- , who wanted all the Bourbons to be banished from France .
Upon the execution of her husband , Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de , now known as `` Veuve Ã galitÃ &apos; &apos; -LRB- Widow Ã galitÃ -RRB- , was incarcerated at the Luxembourg Palace , which had been transformed into a prison during the Revolution .
She married the future Philippe Ã galitÃ , and was the mother of France &apos; s last king , Louis Philippe I , King of the French .
They both appreciated her intelligence and , in July 1779 , she became the governess of the couple &apos; s twin daughters born in 1777 .
There she met the man who was to become the `` love of her life &apos; &apos; , a former member of the National Convention named Jacques-Marie Rouzet .
The style of Mademoiselle de PenthiÃ vre had been previoulsy borne by her sister Marie Louise de Bourbon -LRB- 1751 â `` 1753 -RRB- who died six months after Marie AdÃ laÃ de &apos; s birth .
After the romantic affair was over , FÃ licitÃ remained in the service of Marie AdÃ laÃ de at the Palais-Royal , a trusted friend to both Marie AdÃ laÃ de and Philippe .
After their arrest in Paris , Philippe Ã galitÃ and his son , the comte de Beaujolais , were imprisoned in the Abbey prison -LRB- prison de l &apos;Abbaye -RRB- in Paris .
Marie AdÃ laÃ de was exiled to Spain , as was her sister-in-law Bathilde d &apos;Orl Ã ans .
However , the OrlÃ ans &apos; mind changed when the Prince of Lamballe &apos; s death left his sister sole heiress to the family fortune .
Passionate at first , the liaison cooled within a few months and , by the spring of 1773 , was reported to be `` dead &apos; &apos; .
The fate of the OrlÃ ans family was sealed when Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de &apos; s eldest son , the duc de Chartres , `` GÃ nÃ ral Ã galitÃ &apos; &apos; in the Army of the North commanded by Charles FranÃ ois Dumouriez , sought political asylum from the Austrians in March 1793 .
The two always remained together and lived in Paris until 1797 , when a decree banished the remaining members of the House of Bourbon from France .
Her marriage to Louis Philippe Joseph d &apos;Orl Ã ans , Duke of Chartres , son of the Duke of OrlÃ ans , had been envisaged earlier and , while the Duke of PenthiÃ vre saw in it the opportunity for his daughter to marry into the family of the First Prince of the Blood , the OrlÃ ans did not want a union with an illegitimate branch of the royal family .
During the first few months of their marriage , the couple appeared devoted to each other , but the duke went back to the life of libertinage he had led before his marriage .
It is during the summer of 1772 , a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter , that began Philippe &apos; s secret liaison with one of her ladies-in-waiting , Madame de Genlis , the niece of Madame de Montesson , the morganatic wife of Philippe &apos; s father .
In September 1792 , having sided with the Revolution , the Duke of OrlÃ ans was elected to the National Convention under the name of Philippe Ã galitÃ .
At the death of her brother , Louis Alexandre de Bourbon , prince de Lamballe , she became the wealthiest heiress in France .
On 6 April , all the members of the OrlÃ ans family still remaining in France were arrested .

On the morning of 30 January 1933 , Hindenburg swore Hitler in as Chancellor at the Presidential Palace .
When the budget was defeated in July , BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning had Hindenburg sign the budget as an emergency law under Article 48 .
The ceremony at the Kroll Opera House had the effect of reassuring many Germans , especially conservative Germans , that life would be fine under the new regime .
Hindenburg was still very popular , but his health was getting worse . The Nazis made sure that whenever Hindenburg did appear in public Hitler was with him , and that Hitler was always very respectful to the President .
He was 84 years old and in poor health , but had to run for re-election in 1932 as the only candidate who could defeat Adolf Hitler .
Hindenburg retired again in 1919 , but returned to public life one more time in 1925 to be elected as the second President of Germany .
At the opening of the new Reichstag on 21 March 1933 , at the Kroll Opera House , the Nazis staged an elaborate ceremony , in which Hindenburg played the leading part , that was meant to mark the continuity between the Prussian-German tradition and the new Nazi state .
On 23 March 1933 , Hindenburg signed the Enabling Act into law .
Under a `` Presidential &apos; &apos; government the chancellor is responsible to the president -RRB- , and not the Reichstag .
Hitler &apos; s first act as Chancellor was to ask Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag so that the Nazis and D.N.V.P. could increase their number of seats , Hindenburg agreed .
On 31 May 1932 , Hindenburg sacked BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning as Chancellor and replaced him with Schleicher &apos; s suggestion , Franz von Papen .
One day before Hindenburg &apos; s death , Hitler flew to Neudeck and visited him .
The only time Hindenburg ever tried to stop a Nazi bill was in early April 1933 . The Reichstag had passed a Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service .
Hindenburg issued a press release about his meeting with Hitler that seemed to say that Hitler had demanded absolute power and that the President had refused .
Schleicher and von Papen both believed that the Nazis would win the majority of the seats and would support von Papen &apos; s government .
In the `` Government of National Concentration &apos; &apos; headed by Hitler , the Nazis were in the minority .
The Nazis got 17 % of the vote in the September 1930 elections .
Paul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg -LRB- known as Paul von Hindenburg -RRB- . -LRB- 2 October 1847 â `` 2 August 1934 -RRB- .

Hindenburg , old and senile , thought he was meeting Kaiser Wilhelm II , and called Hitler `` Your Majesty &apos; &apos; .
In May 1932 Schleicher had Hindenburg sack Groener as Defense Minister to humiliate both Groener and BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning .
In the first round of the election held in March 1932 , Hindenburg was the frontrunner , but did not have an absolute majority .
He was helped when the Bavarian People &apos; s Party -LRB- BVP -RRB- , switched its support from Marx , the SPD candidate and the Communist Party of Germany -LRB- KPD -RRB- to did not withdraw its candidate , Ernst ThÃ lmann .
The `` 25 / 48 / 53 formula &apos; &apos; was the three articles of the Constitution that could make a `` Presidential government &apos; &apos; possible :
There ensued another round of talks between Hindenburg , von Papen , von Schleicher on the one hand and Hitler and the other Nazi leaders on the other .
Hindenburg could not accept this , so von Papen suggested Hindenburg declare martial law and do away with democracy .
The younger Hindenburg served as his father &apos; s aide-de-camp and controlled politicians &apos; access to the President .
Hindenburg hated the idea of Hitler as Chancellor , but under pressure from MeiÃ ner , von Papen and Oskar Hindenburg the President decided to appoint Hitler Chancellor .
BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning ruled through Article 48 ; the Social Democrats never voted not to cancel his Article 48 bills in order not to have another election that could only benefit the Nazis and the Communists .
Schleicher &apos; s wanted to have Hindenburg appoint a chancellor that Schleicher chose . If that chancellor needed any laws he could use article 48 .
After the presidential elections had ended , Schleicher held a series of secret meetings with Hitler in May 1932 , and thought that Hitler had agreed to support the new `` presidential government &apos; &apos; Schleicher was building .
The famous zeppelin Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire in 1937 had been named in his honor , as is the causeway joining the island of Sylt to mainland Schleswig-Holstein , the Hindenburgdamm , built during his time in office .
Von Papen got Oscar Hindenburg to support the plan , and they persuaded the president to ignore his oath to the Constitution and go along with this plan .
BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning &apos; s first act was to introduce a budget calling for steep spending cuts and sharp tax increases .
In response , von Papen had Hindenburg dissolve the Reichstag for elections in November 1932 .
BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning &apos; s first act was to introduce a budget calling for steep spending cuts and sharp tax increases . When the budget was defeated in July , BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning had Hindenburg sign the budget as an emergency law under Article 48 .
As a result the government fell in March 1930 and BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning was named Chancellor by Hindenburg .
Because he was Germany &apos; s greatest war hero , Hindenburg won the election in the second round of voting held on 26 April 1925 .
Schleicher came up with the idea of Presidential government , and the `` 25 / 48 / 53 formula &apos; &apos; .
In the runoff election of April 1932 , Hindenburg beat Hitler for the Presidency .
Following Hindenburg &apos; s death , Hitler declared the office of President to be permanently vacant , effectively merging it with the office of Chancellor under the title of Leader and Chancellor -LRB- FÃ 1 \ / 4 hrer und Reichskanzler -RRB- , making himself Germany &apos; s Head of State and Head of government .
In early February 1933 , von Papen had an Article 48 bill signed into law that limited the freedom of press .
According to the minutes :
Besides Hitler , the only other Nazi ministers were Hermann GÃ ring and Wilhelm Frick .
Hindenburg played key role in the Nazi Machtergreifung -LRB- Seizure of Power -RRB- in 1933 .
After the Reichstag fire , Hindenburg signed into law the Reichstag Fire Decree .
Hitler still demanded that Hindenburg give him the Chancellorship .
Schleicher saw von Papen as a threat so he blocked the martial law plan by saying it would make the Nazi SA and the Communist Red Front Fighters rebel , and that the Poles would invade and the Reichswehr would be unable to cope .
In 1925 , Hindenburg had no interest in running for public office .
Hindenburg stayed president until he died from lung cancer at his home in Neudeck , East Prussia on 2 August 1934 .
When the Reichstag voted to cancel the budget , BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning had Hindenburg dissolve Reichstag only two years into its mandate , and had the budget passed again by Article 48 .
Hindenburg hated the idea of Hitler as Chancellor , but under pressure from MeiÃ ner , von Papen and Oskar Hindenburg the President decided to appoint Hitler Chancellor . On the morning of 30 January 1933 , Hindenburg swore Hitler in as Chancellor at the Presidential Palace .
During the winter of 1929 â `` 1930 , Schleicher had a series of secret meetings with Heinrich BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning , the leader of the Catholic Center Party -LRB- Zentrum -RRB- .
After the first round Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , one of the leaders of the DNVP , visited Hindenburg and asked him to run .
In the second Reichstag elections of 1932 the Nazis lost some support , but stayed the largest party in the Reichstag .
Hindenburg died the next year , after which Hitler declared the office of President vacant and made himself Head of State .
The first try at `` presidential government &apos; &apos; in 1926 â `` 1927 failed for lack of political support .
The Communist Party of Germany also made gains .
Hitler was enraged by this press release .
The minutes of the meeting were kept by Otto MeiÃ ner , the Chief of the Presidential Chancellery .
He advisers included his son , Oskar , his old army aide General Wilhelm Groener , and General Kurt von Schleicher .
von Papen &apos; s government openly wanted to destroy German democracy .
Hindenburg was buried in the Tannenberg memorial near Tannenberg , East Prussia -LRB- today : StÄ bark , Poland -RRB- .
When Hindenburg met Hitler on 13 August 1932 , in Berlin , Hindenburg rejected Hitler &apos; s demands for the Chancellorship .
As Schleicher wanted , Hindenburg dissolved the Reichstag and set new elections for July 1932 .
Hindenburg eventually agreed to run in the second round of the elections as a non-party independent , although he was a conservative .
Like BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning &apos; s government , von Papen &apos; s government was a `` presidential government &apos; &apos; that governed through the use of Article 48 .
If the Reichstag should threaten to cancel any of those laws , Hindenburg could threaten a dissolution , and call new elections .
When the Reichstag met in September 1932 , its first and only act was to pass a massive vote of no-confidence in von Papenâ s government .

Breckinridge &apos; s army consisted of Colonel Henry Giltner &apos; s brigade , -LRB- which was formed from the soldiers of the 4th Kentucky Cavalry and the 10th Kentucky Cavalry -RRB- ; the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles -LRB- later renamed to the 13th Kentucky Cavalry -RRB- , and the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantry .
Stoneman ordered Burbridge to bring his army of 4,200 men through the Cumberland Gap to join Stoneman and General Gillem at Knoxville , Tennessee where Gillem was refitting his own command into a picked force of 1,500 men .
At 4 : 00 a.m. -LRB- Local Time -RRB- , they reached the main road near Seven Mile Ford , Virginia where Breckinridge waited for daylight before continuing .
On the 14th , the Union army began to push Duke &apos; s cavalry back toward Abingdon , Virginia .
This gained the approval of Major General John Schofield on December 6 , 1864 .
There General Gillem captured 84 prisoners , including Col. Richard C. Morgan and the brigade &apos; s supply train .
General Breckinridge &apos; s front regiment was the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles , under the command of Colonel Benjamin Caudill .
General Breckinridge sent Witcher and his men of the 34th on ahead of his main force and ordered them to harass the Union army .
The confederate rail breastworks had held , but the holding of the line had resulted in the use of a huge amount of ammunition .
On December 12 , Stoneman &apos; s force flanked and forced back Confederate General Basil Duke &apos; s cavalry at Rogersville , Tennessee .
The vastly outnumbered Rebels had inflicted moderate casualties and slowed the advance on Saltville , but were unable to stop it .
The Union army then ordered another charge with a large cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry .
They then continued to retreat toward Marion .
The Federals defeated and scattered the Confederates the next day at Kingsport , Tennessee .
At about 3 a.m. -LRB- Local Time -RRB- , Breckinridge and his small army began to travel across Walkers Mountain .
Saltville would fall to a night attack on December 20 - December 21 and the salt works would be destroyed by the Union army .
Before the 2nd arrived , Duke and his men counterattacked the Union line and routed it .
The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate army had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works .
The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his army to the point that he could judged that he could no longer hold back the Union army at the front lines .
On the night of December 16 , General Breckinridge and his troops moved out of Saltville , Virginia in an effort to stop Stoneman .
Stoneman did not reveal the objectives of the expedition to his subordinates until three days after it had departed Knoxville on December 10 .
Stoneman would use troops under General Alvan Gillem and those commanded by General Stephen Burbridge -- including the 5th and the 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry who had participated in the failed previous attempt to destroy the salt works at the first Battle of Saltville .
Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Union &apos; s extreme left flank . This Union colored regiment was also completely routed .
Caudill &apos; s men dismounted and fired into the Union cavalry , causing several casualties .
Ammunition in the camp was also running low ; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece .
The rest of Giltner &apos; s Brigade also joined in the charge , routing the Union soldiers .
With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman &apos; s army at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon , there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in time .
On December 16 , Stoneman &apos; s cavalry rode toward Marion , destroying infrastructure and public buildings along their path .
Taking the regular troops with him , Breckinridge left Colonel Robert Preston in charge of the 500 militia men to defend the salt works .
The Battle of Marion -LRB- December 17 â `` December 18 , 1864 -RRB- was a military engagement in the American Civil War that occurred when Major General George Stoneman , commander of the Union Army in Kentucky and Tennessee , raided Southwestern Virginia .
Around noon of December 17 , 1864 , Breckinridge &apos; s men mounted their horses rode toward Marion .
As the rest of Breckinridge &apos; s troops began to arrive on the scene , General Stoneman &apos; s men secured the high hill overlooking the river .
Breckinridge ordered his field officers to make an inspection of the troops and to report back with the condition of his army .
Burbridge &apos; s front regiment easily pushed back Witcher &apos; s small regiment , who stopped just so they could fire a volley into the Union cavalry .
Finding their own path to Saltville &apos; s defenses blocked , Breckinridge and his men retreated further south , while the Union raiders advanced .
Stoneman also sent two regiments of cavalry to destroy the lead mines and smelting facilities that were located about ten miles -LRB- 16 km -RRB- from Wytheville .
Stoneman and Burbridge continued on toward Marion where they encountered Witcher and his men .
Witcher sent a courier to inform Breckinridge that they were coming to join them at Marion .
Breckinridge &apos; s army also included General Basil Duke &apos; s cavalry , General George Cosby &apos; s cavalry and Colonel Vincent Witcher and his 34th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry .
Meanwhile , General Stoneman sent some of his Tennessee regiments to Wytheville , Virginia to destroy anything that looked valuable .
Seeing this , Colonel Giltner sent his regiment to reinforce Duke .
In the last few days before the march , 4 &apos; &apos; of rain fell , making travel difficult across the muddy roads .

It is thought that the first passerines evolved in the southern continent of Gondwana in the Paleogene , maybe around the Upper Paleocene some 60 â `` 55 mya .
The early fossil record is poor because the first Passeriformes were on the small side , and their delicate bones did not preserve well .
They are two species of about 10 and 20 cm in overall length . This proves that some 55 mya , barely into the early Eocene , early perching birds were recognizably distinct .

The song has since been regarded as the centerpiece track on the album .
Not long after , despite not taking the song seriously , Martin &apos; s idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse .
They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste .
Critics were positive towards the song .
A Billboard magazine review said , `` After one single -LRB- ` Yellow &apos; -RRB- and its accompanying album -LRB- Parachutes ... -RRB- , Coldplay have already been anointed heir to the Brit-rock throne . &apos; &apos;
The single includes the songs `` Help Is Round the Corner &apos; &apos; and `` No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground &apos; &apos; . The third song was taken from the band &apos; s first EP , Safety .
Billboard said that `` every time that electric-guitar riff barges in , you &apos; re hooked all over again . &apos; &apos;
To improve the song , they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar .
While composing the song &apos; s lyrics , however , Martin could not find the right words .
The reaction was chiefly positive . Even BBC Radio 2 played the track repeatedly .
The melody `` started off a lot slower &apos; &apos; according to Will Champion , the band &apos; s drummer , and sounded like a Neil Young song .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; is a song by English alternative rock band Coldplay .
People often sing-along when it is played . The song is often played during home games at English Championship club Watford .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; won Best Single at the 2001 NME Carling Awards .
The drawing of a line refers to Martin &apos; s habit of writing lists and underlining those important things on the list .
This is backed by an electric guitar copying the acoustic guitar . It then forwards to the lead guitar line .
It was pressed to 1,000 copies , and was issued only to fans and journalists .
Most people have considered `` Yellow &apos; &apos; as a happy song , even though the lyrics do not seem to be .
The band released a limited-edition CD of `` Trouble &apos; &apos; , the third single off Parachutes , which features a remix of `` Yellow &apos; &apos; .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000 .
Champion said that &apos; &apos; ... it was really difficult to record , because it worked at about five or six different tempos .
The song &apos; s lyrics are a reference to band vocalist Chris Martin &apos; s unreturned love .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; features Martin &apos; s falsetto , and nearly spoken-word whispers .
In the United States , however , the song was released as the lead single off the album .
This heavy rotation continued for months after its releas . `` Yellow &apos; &apos; eventually became 2000 &apos; s most played song on the radio .
The band and Nelson produced the track .
In the US , after it was being used in promos of ABC , the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001 .
According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplay &apos; s second album , A Rush of Blood to the Head , for Spin magazine , the band is still known in the United States for their `` surprise smash ` Yellow &apos; &apos; &apos; .
The studio is called the Quadrangle . It is where Coldplay began working on their first album , Parachutes .
The song was also used as the theme music for The Cancer Council Australia &apos; s `` Daffodil Day &apos; &apos; . This was in recognition of that organization &apos; s official flower &apos; s yellow hue .
It was nominated at the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal .
Nelson used an analog tape to record most of the tracks in the album .
Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone magazine has noted `` Yellow &apos; &apos; is `` unrepentantly romantic &apos; &apos; . He added that `` the band creates a hypnotic slo-mo otherworld where spirit rules supreme &apos; &apos; .
It then goes back to the acoustic section .
The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle .
Outside , there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and `` just amazing &apos; &apos; , according to the song &apos; s co-producer , Ken Nelson .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; was first recorded upstairs in the project studio . This was a demo room in Liverpool &apos; s Parr Street Studios .
At first , Martin did not take it seriously `` as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice &apos; &apos; .
Martin has explained that &apos; &apos; ` Yellow &apos; refers to the mood of the band .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; was used as the theme song for ABC autumn television promotions a month after the album was released in the United States .
Nelson was introduced to the band &apos; s music through the band &apos; s manager .
One night after finishing recording `` Shiver &apos; &apos; , the lead single of the album , the band took a break and went out of the studio .
The band &apos; s bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line `` Look at the stars &apos; &apos; .
He was thinking of a specific word to fit the song &apos; s main idea and theme . He thought that this missing word was a key word in the lyrics .
That night , having quickly composed the song , the band recorded it .
It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play , because sometimes it sounded too rushed , and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging ... &apos; &apos; The band was trying to get the tempo correctly , according to Nelson , `` because a beat either side of the tempo we picked did n &apos;t have the same groove &apos; &apos; .
When Jonny Buckland , the band &apos; s guitarist , started playing it and added to it with his own ideas , they had created the riff , `` and it sort of got a bit heavier &apos; &apos; .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; and `` Shiver &apos; &apos; were first released as EPs in the spring of 2000 .
So Nelson used Pro Tools `` to get the feel of -LRB- the track -RRB- just right &apos; &apos; . Once all of the takes were recorded into the computer , `` we then put it down to the 2-inch , which I found was a great way to do it &apos; &apos; , according to Nelson .
Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone magazine has said that the song was a career-making record .
Martin , after the song &apos; s mixing , felt that his voice was `` too subdued , too quiet &apos; &apos; .
He looked around the studio and found the telephone directory Yellow Pages .
The references in some of the song &apos; s lyrics , including the swimming and drawing a line , `` are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion &apos; &apos; .
Nelson and the band had some problems when they were making some parts of the song .
Helped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions , the song made the band very popular .
Roach has claimed in his book , Coldplay : Nobody Said It Was Easy , that although `` Shiver &apos; &apos; earned the band their first UK Top 40 single , it was `` Yellow &apos; &apos; that has changed `` everything &apos; &apos; , and that it `` exemplifies so much of what had made Coldplay so popular &apos; &apos; .
Martin has said , `` The song had the word ` stars &apos; and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice . &apos; &apos;
Nelson &apos; s manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay . Nelson wanted to work them after seeing the band perform live .
As recording progressed , `` Yellow &apos; &apos; was one of a couple of songs that they `` could n &apos;t quite get on analog &apos; &apos; .
They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output .
The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating .
The song was released across the world in June 2000 . It was the second single off the album following `` Shiver &apos; &apos; .
Brightness and hope and devotion . &apos; &apos;
The single reached number four in the UK Singles Chart . This gave the band their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom .
Various recording artists worldwide have since made their own versions of `` Yellow &apos; &apos; . It remains one of the band &apos; s most popular songs .
In October 2000 , the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets .
Martin has commented that the song is about devotion . He refers to his unrequited love -LRB- Martin was single at the time he wrote the song -RRB- .
But according to him , `` In an alternate universe , this song could be called ` Playboy . &apos; &apos;&apos;
The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson . It was for their first album Parachutes .
Its instrumentation is varied , including the drums , cymbals , and the occasional hi-hat and ascending bass guitar .
The single received a massive radio airplay , particularly on BBC Radio 1 . This was helped by its TV reception through its music video .
He told the band to look at the stars .
Martin later titled the song `` Yellow &apos; &apos; as a reference to the directory .
The song &apos; s main melody popped into the head of Chris Martin , the band &apos; s vocalist . The melody was a chord pattern .

Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall .
The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern , being sensitive to sun light , and losing virulence over time after release .
Over the following summers , Martha &apos; s Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing .
The rate-of-action was around three days , with a duration-of-action of 1 to 3 weeks -LRB- treated -RRB- and 2 to 3 months -LRB- untreated -RRB- with frequent relapses .
In the USA , practical research into using Tularemia as a bioweapon took place at Camp Detrick in the 1950s .
In 2004 , three researchers at Boston University Medical Center were accidentally infected with F. tularensis , after apparently failing to follow safety procedures .
Tularemia -LRB- also called `` Goblin Fever &apos; &apos; , `` deer-fly fever &apos; &apos; , `` Ohara fever &apos; &apos; and `` Francis disease &apos; &apos; -RRB- is a disease .
An outbreak of tularemia occurred in Kosovo in 1999-2000 .
It was viewed as an attractive agent because :
No vaccine is available to the general public .
A former Soviet biological weapons scientist , Kenneth Alibek , has said that an outbreak of Tularemia among German soldiers shortly before the siege of Stalingrad was due to intentional release of F. tularensis by Soviet forces , but this claim is rejected by others who have studied the outbreak .
In 2005 , small amounts of F. tularensis were detected in the Mall area of Washington , DC the morning after an anti-war demonstration on September 24 , 2005 .
The best way to prevent tularemia infection is to wear rubber gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs -LRB- as rabbits -RRB- , avoid ingesting uncooked wild game and untreated water sources , and wearing long-sleeved clothes and using an insect repellent to prevent tick bites .
tularensis could possibly be a bioweapons agent . For this reason , it has been included in the biological warfare programs of the USA , USSR and Japan at various times .
When the 425 strain was standardized as agent JT -LRB- an incapacitant rather than lethal agent -RRB- , the Schu S4 strain &apos; s symbol was changed again to SR .
In summer 2000 , an outbreak of tularemia in Martha &apos; s Vineyard resulted in one dead person . It brought the interest of the CDC as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized Francisella tularensis .
The Schu S4 strain was standardized as Agent UL for use in the M143 bursting spherical bomblet .
In July 2007 , an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of Castile and LeÃ n and traced to the plague of voles infesting the region .

These are known as small morph adults .
These large larvae are usually known as waterdogs , and are used many times in the fishing bait and pet trade .
One of the largest threats to Tiger Salamander populations is wetland -LRB- habitat -RRB- destruction and \ / or changing .
Adults are almost never seen in open fields and often live in holes that are usually 2 feet from the top .
Large-scale captive breeding of Tiger salamanders has not been accomplished , for unknown reasons .
Some larvae , especially in pools that are here one season and gone the next and in the north , may metamorphose as soon as feasible .
Genetic studies made it right to break up the first A. tigrinum population , even though there is some hybridization between groups .
The California Tiger Salamander -LRB- Ambystoma californiense -RRB- , the Barred Tiger Salamander -LRB- Ambystoma mavortium -RRB- , and the Plateau Tiger Salamander -LRB- Ambystoma velasci -RRB- , were all once subspecies of A. tigrinum , but are now separate species .
While remaining common in many places , Tiger Salamander numbers have gone down compared with old levels .
Tiger salamanders almost always stay on land as adults , and usually only return to the water to lay eggs .
Nearly all such salamanders are wild-caught .
The effect of agricultural pesticides in urine disruption has also been researched .
Other larvae , especially in ancestral pools and warmer climates , may not metamorphose until fully adult size .
The Axolotl is also a relative of the Tiger Salamander .
These are the neotenes , and are particularly common where terrestrial conditions are bad .
Since they tend to breed in semipermanent wetlands , baby Tiger Salamanders often experience mass deaths in association with pond drying .
The larvae are entirely aquatic , and are characterized by large gills on the outside and a big tail fin that begins just behind the head .
However , Tiger Salamanders are only listed as endangered in Delaware , New York , New Jersey and Maryland ; protected in Arizona ; and of special concern in both North and South Carolina .
They also like to swim , even if they are on land .
Axolotls live in a neotenous state , keeping most characteristics of their larval stage for their entire lifespan .
They also are good swimmers .
The right name of this type of salamander is the Eastern Tiger Salamander , , to differentiate from other closely related species .
While they never change under natural conditions , metamorphosis can be programmed in them , resulting in a form very similar to the Mexican Tiger Salamander .
-LRB- http : / / www.amphibiaweb.org -RRB- In November 2001 , the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Great Lakes number of the Tiger Salamander as being removed , and the Southern Mountain population in British Columbia &apos; s Okanagan as endangered in Canada .
The Tiger Salamander is species of Mole Salamander .
However , a single tiger salamander has only a 50 % chance of laying eggs more than once in its lifetime .
Males bump a female to initiate mating , and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom .
Fishes that have moved to their ponds have also been known to reduce , and levels they also experience reduced growth and longer larval periods .
Tiger salamander adults are also often sold as pets , or used in research .
Like all ambystomatids , they are extremely loyal to their birthplace , and will travel long distances to go back .
This is not , however , their natural condition , and shortens their lifespan by a lot .
Some populations may not metamorphose at all , and become sexually mature while in their larval form .
The female picks up the packet and deposits the now-fertilized eggs on vegetation .
All of these issues have changed Tiger Salamander populations .
But also they live in both land and water .

It was a creature standing 3 &apos; 6 &apos; &apos; -LRB- 105 cm -RRB- at approximately 20-24 pounds .
The Taung Child is a fossil of a skull .
Raymond Dart , an anatomist at the University of Witwatersrand , received the fossil , recognized its importance and published his discovery in the journal Nature in 1925 , describing it as a new species .
However intermediate species such as Homo ergaster \ / Homo erectus are thought to have gone through growths intermediate between modern humans and apes .
This conclusion was reached by noting similarities in the damage to the skull and eye sockets of the Taung Child to the skulls of primates known to have been killed by modern eagles .
The British establishment was at the time enamored with the hoax Piltdown man , which had a large brain and ape-like teeth -- the exact opposite of the Taung Child -- and Raymond Dart &apos; s finding was not appreciated for decades .
The fossil consists of most of the face and mandible with teeth . It also has a natural endocast -LRB- or imprint -RRB- of the braincase .
In early 2006 it was announced that the Taung Child was likely killed by an eagle -LRB- or similar large predatory bird -RRB- .
Taung Child had a cranial capacity of 340 cc , living mainly in a savanna habitat .
The evidence has mostly been based on that of Turkana Boy discovered in 1984 .

Chloroform was used as an anesthetic during childbirth and surgery , from about 1847 .
Chloroform was named and chemically characterised in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas .
The American physician Samuel Guthrie prepared gallons of the material and described its `` deliciousness of flavor . &apos; &apos;
The first who reported to have produced Chloroform was the French chemist EugÃ ne Soubeiran , in 1831 . Soubeiran took acetone and ethanol , and used bleach powder for the reaction .
Death from chloroform can come from cardiac arrest . When Chloroform is stored for a longer time period , it can decay into Phosgene .
At that time , England had two different court systems . One was called equity and one was called common law .
Common law started in England when courts decided to use tradition , custom , and precedent to help them make decisions . A precedent is something that another court has done in the past .
Today , in most places , there are not two separate systems , and courts sometimes say that they work with both common law and equity .
Many other countries use a system called civil law , where people say that legislation is the only kind of law . In common law countries , courts usually have more power than in civil law countries .

Most of the gastropods of that era belong to primitive groups . A few of these groups still survive today .
By the Carboniferous period many of the shapes seen in living gastropods can be matched in the fossil record . Despite these similarities in appearance , the majority of these older forms are not directly related to living forms .
In rocks of the Mesozoic era gastropods are more common as fossils and their shell is often well preserved .
Rocks of the Cainozoic era have very large numbers of gastropod fossils in them . Many of these fossils are closely related to modern living forms .
The taxonomy of the Gastropoda can be different from author to author . With the arrival of DNA sequencing , further revisions of the higher taxonomic levels are to be expected .
The first gastropods were exclusively marine . The first of the group appeared in the Upper Cambrian -LRB- Chippewaella , Strepsodiscus -RRB- .
It was during the Mesozoic era that the ancestors of many of the living gastropods evolved .
The `` Purbeck Marble &apos; &apos; of the Jurassic period and the `` Sussex Marble &apos; &apos; of the early Cretaceous period which both occur in southern England are limestones containing the tightly packed remains of the pond snail Viviparus .
By the Ordovician period the gastropods were a varied group present in a few aquatic habitats .
Their gills are often in a form of feathery plumes on their backs . This is what gives the name to the nudibranchs .
Most members have a shell , which is in one piece and coiled or spiralled ; it usually opens on the right hand side -LRB- viewed with the shell apex pointing up -RRB- .
Nudibranchs with smooth or warty backs have no visible gill mechanisms and respiration may take place directly through the skin .
The diversity of the gastropods increased markedly at the beginning of this era , along with that of the bivalves .
Their fossils occur in beds of both freshwater and marine environments .
Commonly , fossil gastropods from the rocks of the early Palaeozoic era are too poorly preserved for accurate identification .
Fossil gastropods are less common during the Palaeozoic era than bivalves .
Still , the Silurian genus Poleumita contains fifteen identified species .
Some species have an operculum , a lid or trapdoor to close the shell .
In some , the slugs , the shell is absent , and the body is streamlined .
Relatives of the modern land snails are rare before the Cretaceous period . The familiar Helix first appeared in that period .
Gastropods are one of the groups that record the changes in fauna caused by the advance and retreat of the Ice Sheets during the Pleistocene epoch .
The taxonomy of the Gastropoda is at present under constant revision .

A quadratic equation , for example , has two solutions .
Another is the multiset of solutions of an algebraic equation .
They call this multiplicity .
Certain items are either elements of that multiset , or they are not .
which gives the multiset .
Thus the multiset of solutions of the equation could be , or it could be .
In the latter case it has a solution of multiplicity 2 .
However , in some cases they are both the same number .
One of the simplest examples is the multiset of prime factors of a number n . Here the underlying set of elements is the set of prime divisors of n . For example the number 120 has the prime factorisation

More than a thousand of them represented species new to science .
It was praised by Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell and by others , such as the novelist Joseph Conrad , who called it his `` favorite bedside companion &apos; &apos; .
He also believed that the purpose of the universe was the development of the human spirit .
Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism were subject to much criticism from the press , with The Lancet , the leading English medical journal , being particularly harsh .
Alfred Russel Wallace OM , FRS , -LRB- 8 January 1823 â `` 7 November 1913 -RRB- was a British naturalist , explorer , biologist and social activist .
Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as The Malay Archipelago .
The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals .
Both he and Bates had read Vestiges , a controversial work of popular science , published anonymously in 1844 . This advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system , the earth , and living things .
It strained his relationships with friends such as Bates , Huxley and Darwin , who felt he was overly credulous .
And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in mankind .
From 1854 to 1862 , age 31 to 39 , Wallace traveled through the Dutch East Indies -LRB- now Malaysia and Indonesia -RRB- , to collect specimens for sale and to study nature .
He could only save part of his diary and a few sketches .
Wallace thought that natural selection could not account for mathematical , artistic , or musical genius , as well as metaphysical musings , and wit and humor .
On 12 July 1852 , Wallace embarked for England on the brig Helen .
All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship , most of his collection , were lost .
Wallace collected more than 125,000 specimens in the Dutch East Indies -LRB- more than 80,000 beetles alone -RRB- .
Wallace continued charting the Amazon for four years , collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples , the languages , the geography , flora , and fauna .
After twenty-eight days at sea , balsam in the ship &apos; s cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship .
He eventually said that something in `` the unseen universe of Spirit &apos; &apos; had interceded at least three times in history .
Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig Jordeson .
He is best known for proposing a theory of natural selection .
Wallace &apos; s public support of spiritualism , and his defense of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud , damaged his scientific reputation .
The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter .
Others became openly hostile to Wallace over the issue .

Every year , the Saudi Arabian government &apos; s Ministry of Hajj sets up a tent city to support Muslim pilgrims in the village of Mina , where the ritual Stoning of the Devil takes place as part of the overall Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca .
Some of the tents that were built by Seabees and funded by FEMA are wooden structures covered by tents .
In the military , the term `` tent city &apos; &apos; usually refers to temporary living quarters erected on deployed military bases , such as those found in Bosnia or Iraq .
As such , fire and disease outbreaks are constant concerns .
For sanitary reasons , military tent cities place toilet , shower , and laundry facilities at least 50 feet -LRB- 15m -RRB- from living quarters .
Depending on the branch of service and the length the tent city has been in place , the living space may be equipped with most modern amenities .
Tent cities set up by homeless people may be similar to shanty towns , which are informal settlements in which the buildings are made from of scrap building materials .
Since the late 1990s , Saudi authorities have started using fireproof tents to reduce the risks of a major fire .
In early January 2007 , city officials noted city codes that prohibit living in tents and gave the society one week to evict the occupants of the tent city .
As well , state governments or military organizations set up tent cities to house refugees , evacuees , or soldiers .
Displaced residents are only expected to stay for three to six months .

The first translations in a Western language were published in 1862 by Marquis d &apos;Hervey de Saint-Denys in his PoÃ sies de l &apos; Ã poque des Thang .
Raising my cup I beckon the bright moon , For her , with my shadow , will make three men .

While we were sober , three shared the fun ;
The moon , alas , is no drinker of wine ;

HTST pasteurized milk normally has a refrigerated shelf life of two or three weeks , but ultra pasteurized milk can last much longer when refrigerated , sometimes two or three months .
These agencies say milk has to be HTST pasteurized to have the `` pasteurized &apos; &apos; label .
Pasteurization rules are usually set by national food safety agencies -LRB- like the USDA in the United States and the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom -RRB- .
Instead , pasteurization wants to get a `` log reduction &apos; &apos; in the number of viable organisms . It wants to bring their number down so they are unlikely to cause disease -LRB- assuming the pasteurized product is kept in the refrigerator and consumed before its expiration date -RRB- .
There are different rules for different dairy products , depending on the fat content and what they will be used for .
For example , the pasteurization rules for cream are different than the rules for fluid milk , and the standards for pasteurizing cheese are designed to keep the phosphatase enzyme fresh , which helps in making the cheese .
Researchers have developed more sensitive diagnostics , such as real-time PCR and improved culture methods , that have enabled them to identify pathogens in pasteurized milk .
Milk pasteurization standards have been subject to increasing scrutiny in recent years , due to the discovery of pathogens that are both widespread and heat resistant -LRB- able to survive pasteurization in significant numbers -RRB- .

Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi , a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel was in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China .
Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears ; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load .

Sudafed is a trademark for a common brand which contains pseudoephedrine hydrochloride , though Sudafed PE does not .
Some countries started to replace Pseudoephedrine by other drugs , such as phenylephrine . The reason for this is that pseudoephedrine can be used to make methamphetamine , which is an illegal drug .
The advantage of oral pseudoephedrine over topical nasal preparations , such as oxymetazoline , is that it does not cause rebound congestion -LRB- rhinitis medicamentosa -RRB- ; however , it is more likely to cause adverse effects including high blood pressure .
The salts pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate are found in many over-the-counter drugs either as single-ingredient preparations , or more commonly in combination with antihistamines , paracetamol -LRB- acetaminophen -RRB- and \ / or ibuprofen .

Babylon threw off the Assyrian rule in 612 BC and became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Chaldean Empire .
The walls of Babylon were impenetrable , and the only way into the city was through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates , which ebbed beneath its thick walls .
All that was ever found of the Original Ishtar gate was the foundation and scattered bricks .
The early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk , but by the reign of Darius III , over-taxation and the strains of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon &apos; s main shrines and canals , and the disintegration of the surrounding region .
In Achaemenid Persia , the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalised and flourished , and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations .
In 539 BC , the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great , king of Persia , in the famous Battle of Opis .
Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the ` holy city &apos; of Mesopotamia around the time Hammurabi first unified the Babylonian Empire , and became the capital city of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 612 to 539 BC .
Cyrus devised a plan to use the Euphrates as the mode of entry to the city . He ordered large camps of troops at each point and instructed them to wait for the signal .
Awaiting an evening of a national feast among Babylonians , Cyrus &apos; troops diverted the Euphrates river upstream , causing the Euphrates to drop to about ` mid thigh level on a man &apos; or to dry up altogether .
Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius the Great , Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy -LRB- Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north -RRB- , as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement .
The city was the administrative capital of the Persian Empire , the preeminent power of the then known world , and it played a vital part in the history of that region for over two centuries .
In 689 BC , its walls , temples and palaces were razed , and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu , the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south .
Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era .
The town flourished and attained prominence and political repute .
With the recovery of Babylonian independence , a new era of building followed , and Nebuchadnezzar II -LRB- 604 â `` 561 BC -RRB- made Babylon into one of the wonders of the ancient world .
Babylon was a city-state of ancient Mesopotamia , the remains of which are found in present-day Iraq , about 85 kilometers -LRB- 55 mi -RRB- south of Baghdad .
Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds , including rebuilding the Etemenanki ziggurat and the construction of the Ishtar Gate â &apos; &apos; the most spectacular of eight gates that ringed the perimeter of Babylon .
Babylon was at first a small town which sprung up at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC .
Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people , including the Jews , to return to their own land -LRB- as explained in the Old Testament -RRB- , to allow their temple to be rebuilt back in Jerusalem .
Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon -LRB- one of the seven wonders of the ancient world -RRB- , said to have been built for his homesick wife Amyitis .
All that remains of the original ancient famed city of Babylon today is a mound of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers .
This act shocked the religious conscience of Mesopotamia . After the murder of Sennacherib by two of his sons , his successor Esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city .
Despite three attempts at rebellion in 522 BC , 521 BC and 482 BC , the land and city of Babylon remained solidly under Persian rule for two centuries , until Alexander the Great &apos; s entry in 331 BC .
During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria , Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt , and was suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon .

On 7 May 2008 , Johnson announced plans to ban the consumption of alcohol on the London transport network , effective from 1 June , a policy described by Jeroen Weimar , Transport for London &apos; s director of transport policing and enforcement , as reasonable , saying people should be more considerate on the trains .
They have two sonsâ &apos; &apos; Theodore Apollo -LRB- born 1999 -RRB- and Milo Arthur -LRB- born 1995 -RRB- â &apos; &apos; and two daughtersâ &apos; &apos; Lara Lettice -LRB- born 1993 -RRB- and Cassia Peaches -LRB- born 1997 -RRB- .
His father &apos; s maternal grandmother , Marie Louise de Pfeffel , was a descendent of Prince Paul of WÃ 1 \ / 4 rttemberg through his relationship with a German actress .
In September 2007 he was selected as the Conservative candidate for the 2008 Mayor of London election .
Johnson was dismissed from these high-profile posts in November , 2004 over accusations that he lied to Michael Howard about a four-year extramarital affair with Petronella Wyatt , The Spectators New York correspondent and former deputy editor .
Press releases said that the ban would apply to `` stations across the capital &apos; &apos; , but did not specify whether this included National Rail stations - especially those stations not served by the TfL lines on which alcohol is banned .
He was educated at the European School in Brussels , Ashdown House and then at Eton College , where he was a King &apos; s Scholar .
In reference to his cosmopolitan ancestry , Johnson has described himself as a `` one-man melting pot &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; with a combination of Muslims , Jews and Christians comprising his great-grandparentage .
The London Overground will be added later in June 2008 .
Boris Johnson and his family currently live in Holloway , North London .
He was appointed Shadow Minister for Higher Education on 9 December 2005 by new Conservative Leader David Cameron , and resigned as editor of The Spectator soon afterwards .
Under Michael Howard , Johnson briefly served on the Conservative front bench as the Shadow Minister for the Arts from April 2004 until November 2004 when he was sacked after allegedly lying to Howard when denying he had had an affair with Petronella Wyatt .
On the final evening on which alcohol was to be permitted on London transport , thousands of drinkers descended on the Underground system to mark the event .
He began his journalism career with The Times , and later moved on to The Daily Telegraph where he was assistant editor .
Though some questioned his suitability for the role , Johnson defeated Labor incumbent Ken Livingstone and was elected Mayor , after which he resigned as an MP from the House of Commons .
After several days of speculation , Johnson announced he was a potential Conservative candidate for the London mayoral election in 2008 on 16 July 2007 .
In 2001 , Johnson was elected MP for Henley-on-Thames , succeeding Michael Heseltine , having previously been defeated in Clwyd South in the 1997 general election .
He was appointed editor of The Spectator in 1999 .
On 2 April 2006 it was alleged in the News of the World that Johnson had had another extramarital affair , this time with Times Higher Education Supplement journalist Anna Fazackerley .
Johnson is the eldest of the four children of Stanley Johnson , a former Conservative MEP and employee of the European Commission and World Bank , and his first wife , painter Charlotte Fawcett -LRB- later Wahl -RRB- , the daughter of Sir James Fawcett , a prominent barrister and president of the European Commission of Human Rights .
In the 2001 general election he was elected to the House of Commons and became one of the most high profile politicians in the country , partly because of his distinctive appearance and persona .
The Wheeler and Johnson families have known each other for decades , and Marina Wheeler was at the European School in Brussels at the same time as her future husband .
Johnson derided these allegations as `` an inverted pyramid of piffle &apos; &apos; , but Howard sacked Johnson because he believed press reports showed Johnson had lied , rather than for the affair itself .
On his father &apos; s side Johnson is great-grandson of Ali Kemal Bey , a liberal Turkish journalist and interior minister in the government of Damat Ferid Pasha , Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire , who was murdered during the Turkish War of Independence .
Johnson &apos; s sister Rachel was born a year later .
The video shows him emerging from her flat and waving to her in a taxi .
Frank Luntz and Radek Sikorski have claimed Johnson touted himself as a supporter of the Social Democratic Party , then a dominant current at the university , as a strategy to win the Union presidency , though Johnson denies he was more than the SDP &apos; s preferred candidate .
When contemporary David Cameron was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 2005 , Johnson was re-appointed to the front bench as Shadow Minister for Higher Education and resigned as editor of The Spectator to concentrate on his new role .
Johnson was born in New York City , New York , USA , but his family returned to England soon afterwards as his mother had yet to take her Oxford finals .
Six London Underground stations were closed as trouble began , and a number of staff and police were assaulted .
In 1987 he married Allegra Mostyn-Owen but the marriage lasted less than a year , finally being dissolved in 1993 .
Johnson was educated at Eton and Balliol College , Oxford , where he read Classics .
The ban initially applies on the London Underground , Buses , DLR and Croydon Trams .
Subsequently , in a speech at the University of Exeter concerning student finance , he allegedly made comical remarks about his gratitude to the audience for not `` raising other issues &apos; &apos; during the talk , which may have been a reference to the allegations .
He read Classics at Balliol College , Oxford , as a Brackenbury scholar , and was elected President of the Oxford Union , at his second attempt .
During World War I , Boris &apos; s grandfather and great aunt were recognized as British subjects and took their grandmother &apos; s maiden name of Johnson .
Later that same year he married Marina Wheeler , a barrister , the daughter of journalist and broadcaster Sir Charles Wheeler and his Sikh Indian wife , Dip Singh .
Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson -LRB- born 19 June 1964 -RRB- is a British politician and journalist .
Reported as saying `` the opportunity is too great and the prize too wonderful to miss ... the chance to represent London and speak for Londoners &apos; &apos; , he resigned as Shadow Minister for Higher Education .
Johnson was present at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics as London &apos; s representative to receive the Olympic flag from Guo Jinlong , the Mayor of Beijing in order to formally announce London as Olympic host city .
As a child , Boris Johnson suffered from severe deafness and had to undergo several operations to have grommets inserted in his ears , and was reportedly rather quiet as a child .
In 2004 he was appointed to the front bench as Shadow Minister for the Arts in a small reshuffle resulting from the resignation of the Shadow Home Affairs Spokesman , Nick Hawkins .
Through Prince Paul , Johnson is a descendent of King George II of Great Britain and through George &apos; s great-great-great grandfather King James I of England , a descendent of all the previous British royal houses .

Another theory is that it was originally Viashaw , meaning way or road through the wood .
In November 1996 , the world &apos; s worst recorded outbreak of E. coli occurred in the town , in which 20 people died and around 200 were infected .
One suggestion is that it is from the Scots word for `` Wicket gate in the wood &apos; &apos; , and that it used to be called Wygateshaw .
Wishaw is a town in North Lanarkshire , Scotland . It is bordered by Motherwell and Carluke , and is split into several areas such as Netherton , Craigneuk , Newmains , Cambusnethan and Pather .
Yet another theory is that the name derives from `` Wee Shaw &apos; &apos; , meaning small wood .

The discoveries were announced on October 31 , 2005 , after confirmation by precoveries from 2002 .
The initial proposal was to use the Classical spelling Nyx , but to avoid confusion with the asteroid 3908 Nyx , this was changed to `` the Egyptian spelling of the Greek name &apos; &apos; .
In the discovery image , Nix is 6,300 times fainter than Pluto .
Early research appeared to show that Nix was reddish like Pluto and unlike the other moons , but more recent reports have been that it is gray like the remaining moons .
The moons were designated S \ / 2005 P 1 -LRB- Hydra -RRB- and S \ / 2005 P 2 -LRB- Nix -RRB- .
Nix is slightly fainter than Hydra , suggesting that it is somewhat smaller in size .
The formal name `` Nix &apos; &apos; , from the Greek goddess of darkness and night , and mother of Charon , was announced on June 21 , 2006 on IAU Circular 8723 , where the designation Pluto II is also given .
Together with Hydra , Pluto &apos; s third moon , the initials are those of the New Horizons probe .
Although its size has not been directly measured , the moon is calculated to have a diameter of between 46 km , if its reflectivity is similar to Charon &apos; s 35 % , and 137 km , if it has a reflectivity of 4 % , like the darkest Kuiper Belt Objects .
Nix is a non-spherical moon of Pluto .
Nix is to be visited along with Pluto by the New Horizons mission in 2015 .

The known-plaintext attack -LRB- KPA -RRB- is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has samples of both the plaintext and its encrypted version -LRB- known as ciphertext version -RRB- then he can use them to expose further secret information after calculating the secret key .
Encrypted file archives such as ZIP are very prone to this attack .
For example , an attacker with an encrypted ZIP file needs only one unencrypted file from the archive which forms the `` known-plaintext &apos; &apos; .
Classical ciphers are typically susceptible to known-plaintext attack .
For example , a Caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely .
Then using some publicly available software they can instantly calculate the key required to decrypt the entire archive .

One of stratigraphy &apos; s basic concepts is codified in the law of superposition , which simply states that , in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence , the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence .
It is primarily used in the study of sedimentary and layered igneous rocks .
Smith , known as the Father of English Geology , created the first geological map of England . He first recognized the significance of strata or rock layering , and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata .
This timescale remained a relative scale until the development of radiometric dating , which gave it an absolute time framework .
It gives evidence of the formation -LRB- speciation -RRB- and extinction of species .
The first practical large scale application of stratigraphy was by William Smith in the 1790s and early 19th century .
Biostratigraphy was based on William Smith &apos; s principle of faunal succession , which was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for evolution .
The geological timescale was developed during the 19th century based on the evidence of biostratigraphy and faunal succession .
Lithostratigraphy deals with the physical rock type and how it changes from place to place . Changes in the rock -LRB- facies change -RRB- reflect changing environments of deposition .

At the same time , neither recognition is enough to create a state , nor does its absence abolish it . &apos; &apos;
The European Union , in the principal statement of its Badinter Committee , follows the Montevideo Convention in its definition of a state : by having a territory , a population , and a political authority .
The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications : -LRB- a -RRB- a permanent population ; -LRB- b -RRB- a defined territory ; -LRB- c -RRB- government ; and -LRB- d -RRB- capacity to enter into relations with the other states .
Some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient , as they allow less-recognized entities like the Republic of China -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- or even entirely non-recognized entities like the Principality of Sealand to claim full status as states .
The convention is about what is a state and what rights and duties it has .
The committee also found that the existence of states was a question of fact , while the recognition by other states was purely declaratory and not a determinative factor of statehood .
At this conference , United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull declared the so-called Good Neighbor Policy which opposed U.S. armed intervention in inter-American affairs .
The convention was signed by 19 states , three with reservations -LRB- Brazil , Peru and the United States -RRB- .
According to the alternative constitutive theory of statehood , a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by other states .
It should not be confused with the Estrada doctrine .
Some non-territorial entities , notably the Sovereign Military Order of Malta , are indeed considered subjects of international law , but these do not aspire to statehood .
Most well-known is article 1 , which sets out the four criteria for statehood that have sometimes been recognized as an accurate statement of customary international law :
This is known as the declarative theory of statehood .
Founders of non-territorial micronations commonly assert that the requirement in the Montevideo Convention of a defined territory is in some way wrong-headed , for largely unspecified reasons .
In addition , the first sentence of article 3 explicitly states that `` The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states . &apos; &apos;
Switzerland , although not a member of the European Union , adheres to the same principle , stating that `` neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state , nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one .
There have also been attempts to further broaden the convention &apos; s definition , although they have gained less support .
The treaty was signed at Montevideo , Uruguay , on December 26 , 1933 , at the Seventh International Conference of American States .
