That scale will indicate the answer .
The Navitimer circular rule , referred to by Breitling as a `` navigation computer &apos; &apos; , featured airspeed , rate \ / time of climb \ / descent , flight time , distance , and fuel consumption functions , as well as kilometerâ &apos; &apos; nautical mile and gallonâ &apos; &apos; liter fuel amount conversion functions .
It was around that time , as engineering became a recognized professional activity , that slide rules came into wide use in Europe .
The importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers , a new but very scarce resource in the 1950s , became widely available to technical workers during the 1960s .
The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as digital computing devices were being gradually introduced ; but around 1974 the electronic scientific calculator made it largely obsolete and most suppliers left the business .
In 2004 , education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on prosthaphaeresis , an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms .
Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left -LRB- for subtraction -RRB- or right -LRB- for addition -RRB- then returning the slide to 0 to read the result .
Pocket rules are typically 5 inches .
Some high-end slide rules have magnifier cursors that make the markings easier to see .
For painted slide rules , and the faint of heart , use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth .
His design and uses for the tool gave the slide rule purpose outside of mathematical inquiry .
For instance , there are two nines on the A scale ; to find the square root of nine , use the first one ; the second one gives the square root of 90 .
Users of slide rules would simply approximate or drop small terms to simplify the calculation .
Here the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer .
The main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a dish , and limited number of scales .
Astronomical work also required fine computations , and in the 19th century Germany a steel slide rule about 2 meters long was used at one observatory .
Because , this position on the bottom scale gives , the product of and .
Many computer centers had a framed slide rule hung on a wall with the note `` In case of emergency , break glass . &apos; &apos;
For example , a 10 cm circular would have a maximum precision equal to a 30 cm ordinary slide rule .
For example , to calculate 3 Ã -- 2 , the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale .
All premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved , and then filled with paint or other resin .
Typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures , and the user estimates the third figure .
Tangents are found by comparing the T scale with C for angles less than 45 degrees . for angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used .
In addition to the logarithmic scales , some slide rules have other mathematical functions encoded on other auxiliary scales .
A sliding cursor with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or , in duplex models , are on the other side of the rule .
Various other conveniences have been developed .
The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient , 2.75 .
Introduced at US $ 395 , even this was considered expensive for most students .
The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale .
This was especially useful for fractional powers .
Aluminium Pickett-brand slide rules were carried on five Apollo space missions , including to the moon , according to advertising on Pickett &apos; s N600 slide rule boxes .
In 1630 , William Oughtred of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule , and in 1632 he combined two Gunter rules , held together with the hands , to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule .
The Ln scale was invented by an 11th grade student , Stephen B. Cohen , in 1958 .
Later , the inventor created a set of `` marks &apos; &apos; on the Ln scale to extend the range beyond the 2.3 limit , but Pickett never incorporated these marks on any of its slide rules .
Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper , not on the slide rule .
The basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the widest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 -LRB- i.e. by -RRB- .
Rather than `` split &apos; &apos; scales , high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales .
While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation , and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions , the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use .
The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales .
Some slide rules -LRB- `` duplex &apos; &apos; models -RRB- have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip , others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip -LRB- which can usually be pulled out , flipped over and reinserted for convenience -RRB- , still others on one side only -LRB- `` simplex &apos; &apos; rules -RRB- .
Common forms such as can be read directly from x on the S scale to the result on the D scale , when the C-scale index is set at k . For angles below 5.7 degrees , sines , tangents , and radians are approximately equal , and are found on the ST or SRT -LRB- sines , radians , and tangents -RRB- scale , or simply divided by 57.3 degrees \ / radian .
The second method utilizes a sliding linear L scale available on some models .
Computers also changed the nature of calculation .
William Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on logarithms by John Napier .
The Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions .
Since its establishment in 1773 , Istanbul Technical University has managed to keep itself up-to-date by following the technological developments which have occurred worldwide .

In other words , EJB QL queries do not use tables and their components , but enterprise beans , their persistent state , and their relationships .
The used queries are somewhat different from relational SQL , as it uses a so-called `` abstract schema &apos; &apos; of the enterprise beans instead of the relational model .
EJB QL is a database query language similar to SQL .
EJB QL or EJB-QL is a portable database query language for Enterprise Java Beans .
The result of an EJB QL query is either a single object , a collection of entity objects of a given type , or a collection of values retrieved from CMP fields .
One has to understand the data model of enterprise beans in order to write effective queries .
Compared to SQL , however , it is less complex but less powerful as well .
The result of an SQL query is a set of rows with a fixed number of columns .
The language has been inspired , especially EJB3-QL , by the native Hibernate Query Language HQL .

Built of brick and wood , it had two stories with a three story tower .
After she graduated in 1890 , she went on to study at the University of Chicago and Syracuse University , before returning to Hiram in 1896 .
Funding came from hundreds of contributors and friends , prominently the Kresge Foundation , however no single donor contributed enough to confer a name to the building , and so it remains the Hiram College Library .
An observatory with its telescope , a gift of Lathrop Cooley , was a prominent feature of the building until 1939 .
The Library has grown , added and subtracted parts , nearly been destroyed , and moved from one end of the campus to the other in its 100 + year career .
A comprehensive capital campaign by the college featured the construction of a $ 7.1 million facility as its centerpiece .
It was made possible by a substantial gift from Mr. and Mrs. Harley C. Price , and the Library was renamed the Teachout-Price Memorial Library .
Features of the new building included space for a video studio , a redesigned Archives and Special Collections , a Library Instruction Room , group study rooms , and a multi-functional space , the Pritchard Room .
In 1948 a further addition to the south side of the Library was built , again with funds from the Teachout Foundation .
Prior to 1900 , library facilities at Hiram College consisted of the small libraries of each of the student literary societies : Delphic , Hesperian , and Olive Branch .
By the late 1980s the continued growth of the collection , the demand for more study space , and the need to incorporate new technologies led to the decision to plan for a new building .
The Teachout-Cooley Library of Hiram College was erected in 1900 with money given by Abram Teachout .
While a student at Hiram , she was made the librarian of the Olive Branch Society , and did such an excellent job that she was asked to organized the libraries of the other societies .
The west end of the browsing room was designated the Vachel Lindsay Room , and the east end as the Adelaide Robbins Rhodes Room .
Since then , change has been a nearly continuous process with modifications and improvements to the collections , services , and spaces of the Library becoming a yearly , monthly , and weekly affair .
The card catalog was saved from fire damage and much of the lost book collection was replaced .
In 1923 , a supplemental gift from the Teachout family made possible an addition built to the south of the original building , and joined to it by means of a vestibule .
Shortly thereafter , the Library provided access to its new online catalog , and two years later joined the OhioLINK Consortium , thereby expanding the options of our students , faculty , and staff far beyond the walls of the new building .
This expanded the building westward toward Dean Street and effectively doubled the size of the Library once again .
Finally , a fourth addition was necessary by 1963 .
The Libraryâ s collections then consisted of those books donated by the literary societies and the depository collection .
The Media Center became administratively incorporated into the Library .
Completed in 1995 , the collections , equipment , and some of the furnishings of the Library were relocated in the new building that summer .
She served as the collegeâ s Librarian until 1907 , and introduced the Dewey Decimal System to the Library .
But it hasnâ t always been the same place , or even in the same place , through its history .
A Greek portico entrance was added , and the size of the Library was essentially doubled .
A newer , more modern building was erected with a main reading room on the lower floor and a browsing room above .
The Hiram College Library has provided a welcoming , comfortable , and intellectually stimulating environment for many generations of students , faculty , staff , and community members .
These were consolidated by the first Librarian of the college , Emma Ryder .
Pitar and Maluma decide to leave the band , stating , `` We should leave in time , leave Re and his new Reich , which , when I &apos; m taking into account Thorn &apos; s previous reign , would be the Third over here . &apos; &apos;
With regard to these underlying comparisons , Gayer says , `` On another level we are struck by the permanent notional commingling of the simian and the human , a composition which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we , who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense , should finally classify man . &apos; &apos;
The numerous expressions in foreign languages , especially in Latin , remain untranslated in the first edition .

In deliberating his social and natural environment , Pitar decides to lead his band to civilization : â Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness , to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on .
Costello perceives the group of females as his personal harem , but when Maluma falls in love with Pitar she breaks off her relationship with him .
The band builds windbreaks to help them descend more often from the trees , thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground .
The author subsequently released such a glossary on his own website .
This repose , however , is disrupted by the attack of a saber-toothed cat .
Hominid takes place several million years ago in the Central African transitional region between rainforest and savanna .
Ebner first considered writing a novel in which prehistoric characters have present-day knowledge and a modern language in 2006 .

A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member , Re , who not only questions the leading abilities of the present alpha but also desires Costello &apos; s females .
Pitar and Maluma head toward the savanna , an action which alludes to both the expulsion from paradise and the Out of Africa theory .
The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses , an extinct , mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire .
Costello , however , considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power , citing famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln ; the other members ruin this noble idea with their lack of discipline and ostentatious indifference .
Several members of the band are killed , including Costello , thus enabling Re to assume power .

Testing of prototypes commenced in December 1993 , and the roll-out of the system was carried out from August 1996 to April 1998 .
The contract was signed in May 1994 , with the major technology supplier being the ERG Group .
The original Metcard contract with OneLink was to last nine years , expiring in March 2007 .
Public field trials were carried out on buses from August 20 , 1996 , and on rail services from September 18 , 1996 .
The machines were attacked by vandals frequently -LRB- often by pouring liquids into the coin slot -RRB- , and have seen several revisions to their design since .
The State Government renegotiated with ticketing network contract operator OneLink Transit Systems to improve the service to commuters .
Usability was also improved , with tram machines able to sell daily tickets .
Tenders were called for the design , supply , installation and on-going maintenance of the system , with the ` OneLink Transit Consortium &apos; becoming the preferred tenderer in September 1993 .
In March 2007 the Nightrider bus service was also brought under the Metcard system .
An audit released by the State Government in 2001 showed over 1 in 4 -LRB- 27.2 % -RRB- of the machines at train stations did not work , and 11.9 % of mobile equipment in buses and trams was non-operational .
Following these improvements , a 2002 audit showed an increase in availability of machines to 92.1 % at train stations , and 98.3 % on buses and trams .
In 2005 the contract was amended to permit the system to be extended and modified as work on the replacement myki project progresses , with the contract being able to be terminated on six months notice .
Controversy surrounded Metcard at its introduction , due to cost over-runs , the abolition of tram conductors and the unreliability of ticket purchasing and validation machines .
The Melbourne zonal fare system is broken up into two ticketing Zones : Zone 1 -LRB- Yellow -RRB- and Zone 2 -LRB- Blue -RRB- . The two zones form concentric rings , with Zone 1 comprising the inner suburbs , and Zone 2 covering the remainder of metropolitan Melbourne .
Contractual issues between OneLink and the Victorian Government were not settled until May 2002 with the payment of up to $ 65 million in a staged settlement .
The system commenced full revenue service from May 1998 at a cost of $ 330 million .
Furthermore , vandalism across the network dropped by 62 % between 2001 and 2002 .
HÃ rcules de Miranda , commonly known as just HÃ rcules -LRB- June 2 , 1912 -- September 3 , 1982 -RRB- , was a Brazilian football forward , who played in the 1938 FIFA World Cup with the Brazilian national team .
The nouns and adjectives are created by removing the ending and thus obtaining the root .
Verb infinitives in Interlingue most frequently end in - ar or - er .
The root is obtained by the following way :
After adding - r or - er , one obtains the infinitive in the majority of cases : decora \ / t \ / ion , decora \ / t - , decora \ / r .
The de Wahl &apos; s Rule is a rule of word formation , developed by the Balto-German naval officer and teacher Edgar de Wahl and applied in the artificial language Interlingue -LRB- also called `` Occidental &apos; &apos; -RRB- which was also his creation .
After a possible modification one can apply this rule to create new forms of a word especially in Romance languages or in languages which borrowed vocabulary from Romance languages .
This rule is applied in the language Occidental .
Because the rule is actually made of three parts , it also known as the `` three rules of de Wahl &apos; &apos; .
and the verbs formed out of them using prefixes .
Vincenzo `` Enzo &apos; &apos; Bearzot -LRB- 26 September 1927 â `` 21 December 2010 -RRB- was an Italian association football player and manager .
He stayed in Selimiye Prison -LRB- Istanbul -RRB- and was released in 1974 following a general amnesty .
He was banned from leaving the country between 1971 and 1991 .
There are also a number of books dealing with the Kurds in Turkey .
RagÄ p Zarakolu grew up with members of the Greek and Armenian minority in Turkey . In 1968 he began writing for `` Ant &apos; &apos; and `` Yeni Ufuklar &apos; &apos; magazines .
At that time his father , Remzi Zarakolu , was the district governor on that island .
The Belge Publishing House , established in Istanbul in 1977 by Zarakolu and his wife AyÅ enur , has been a focus for Turkish censorship laws ever since .
On his release Zarakolu refused to abandon his campaign for freedom of thought , striving for an `` attitude of respect for different thoughts and cultures to become widespread in Turkey &apos; &apos; .
The series of 35 books consisted of poems , shorts stories , novels .
He also has published several books on the Armenian Genocide , such as George Jerjian &apos; s The Truth Will Set Us Free : Armenians and Turks Reconciled and Professor Dora Sakayan &apos; s An Armenian Doctor in Turkey : Garabed Hatcherian : My Smyrna Ordeal of 1922 -- which brought new criminal charges in 2005 .
RagÄ p Zarakolu was tried on charges of secret relations to Amnesty International .
In 1995 the Belge Publishing House offices were firebombed by a far right group , forcing it to be housed in a cellar .
Until the military coup of 12 September 1980 Belge Publishing House mostly published academic and theoretical books .
The list of publications -LRB- see a list of selected publications below -RRB- include more than 10 books -LRB- translations -RRB- of Greek literature , 10 books on the Armenian Question and five books related to the Jews in Turkey .
Since his wife &apos; s death in 2002 , Zarakolu continued to face further prosecutions .
He spent five months in prison , before the charges were dropped .
Afterwards Belge started to publish a series of books written by political prisoners .
RagÄ p Zarakolu -LRB- born 1948 -RRB- is a Turkish human rights activist and publisher who has long faced legal harassment for publishing books on controversial subjects in Turkey , especially on minority and human rights in Turkey .

In 1979 RagÄ p Zarakolu was one of the founders of the daily newspaper Demokrat and took responsibility for the news desk on foreign affairs .
In 1986 he became one of 98 founders of the Human Rights Association in Turkey -LRB- HRA or in Turkish IHD -RRB- .
In 1972 RagÄ p Zarakolu was sentenced to 2 years &apos; imprisonment for his article in the journal Ant -LRB- Pledge -RRB- on Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam War .
The paper was banned with the military coup of 12 September 1980 and RagÄ p Zarakolu was shortly imprisoned in 1982 in connection with this position in Demokrat .

Britpop is a subgenre of alternative rock that originated in the United Kingdom .
Britpop emerged from the British independent music scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands influenced by British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s .
The movement developed as a reaction against various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s , particularly the grunge phenomenon from the United States .
The common plural -LRB- perhaps because of the association between the plurals lyrics and words -RRB- , predominates contemporary usage .
Use of the singular form lyric to refer to a song &apos; s complete set of words is grammatically acceptable .
The U.S. Music Publishers &apos; Association -LRB- MPA -RRB- , which represents sheet music companies , launched a legal campaign against such websites in December 2005 , the MPA &apos; s president , Lauren Keiser , said the free lyrics web sites are `` completely illegal &apos; &apos; and wanted some website operators jailed .
The word lyric came to be used for the `` words of a song &apos; &apos; ; this meaning was recorded in 1876 .
The Plantagenet kingdom , covering England and much of France from 1152 to 1453 , encouraged wine trade between the regions .
The meaning of `` claret &apos; &apos; has changed over time to refer to a dry , dark red Bordeaux .
In the Late Middle Ages , a claret meant a spiced wine-based drink produced by pouring heated wine , usually a red , over a bag containing a mix of spices .
It was similar , and often identical , to hypocras .
The term now more frequently applies to unspiced red Bordeaux wine .
It used to be closer to a rosÃ , hence the French clairet , meaning pale .
Spices that were specific to medieval clarets include anise , caraway , cardamom , cinnamon and fennel .
As the taste for clairet developed in England , the word was adopted and gradually anglicised to `` claret &apos; &apos; .
The standard style of Bordeaux wine has not always been deep red .

RoquestÃ ron-Grasse is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in southeastern France .
Her murder following the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church .
Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their `` stepsister &apos; &apos; because she was so good and never got into trouble , recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs .
Her French tutor Pierre Gilliard said Maria was tall and well-built , with rosy cheeks .
As a punishment for her surprising behavior , the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed ; however Nicholas objected , stating , `` I was always afraid of the wings growing .
However , on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous .
I am glad to see she is only a human child . &apos; &apos;
However , further remains were discovered in 2007 , and DNA analysis subsequently proved that the entire Imperial family had been murdered in 1918 .
`` Fortunately , I arrived just at that moment , picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar , who was still talking about Dreyfus , &apos; &apos; recalled her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia .
Eagar noted that Maria &apos; s love for her father was `` marked &apos; &apos; and she often tried to escape from the nursery to `` go to Papa . &apos; &apos;
During her lifetime , Maria , too young to become a Red Cross nurse like her elder sisters during World War I , was patroness of a hospital and instead visited wounded soldiers .
When the Tsar was ill with typhoid , the little girl covered a miniature portrait of him with kisses every night .
Tatiana Botkina thought the expression in Maria &apos; s eyes was `` soft and gentle . &apos; &apos;
Throughout her lifetime she was noted for interest in the lives of the soldiers . The flirtatious Maria had a number of innocent crushes on the young men she met , beginning in early childhood .
As an infant and toddler , her physical appearance was compared to one of Botticelli &apos; s angels .
Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia nicknamed her `` The Amiable Baby &apos; &apos; because of her good nature .
She was an elder sister of the famous Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia , whose alleged escape from the assassination of the imperial family was rumored for nearly 90 years .
As a toddler , little Maria once escaped from her bath and ran naked up and down the palace corridor while her distracted Irish nurse , Margaretta Eagar , who loved politics , discussed the Dreyfus Affair with a friend .

where is the magnitude of the physical stimulus , Ï -LRB- I -RRB- is the psychophysical function relating to the subjective magnitude of the sensation evoked by the stimulus , a is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation and k is a proportionality constant that depends on the type of stimulation and the units used .
Although the idea of a power law had been suggested by 19th-century researchers , Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957 .
An interesting feature of the above solutions is that when two or more of the lengths are the same -LRB- e.g. -RRB- , there are multiple wavefunctions corresponding to the same total energy .
In quantum mechanics , the wavefunction gives the most fundamental description of the behavior of a particle ; the measurable properties of the particle -LRB- such as its position , momentum and energy -RRB- may all be derived from the wavefunction .
In classical systems , for example a ball trapped inside a heavy box , the particle can move at any speed within the box and it is no more likely to be found at one position than another .
The model is mainly used as a hypothetical example to illustrate the differences between classical and quantum systems .
Likewise , it can never have zero energy , meaning that the particle can never `` sit still &apos; &apos; .
The size -LRB- or amplitude -RRB- of the wavefunction at a given position is related to the probability of finding a particle there by .
For the above case two of the lengths are equal so the system is symmetric with respect to a 90 Â rotation .
This can be explained in terms of the uncertainty principle , which states that the product of the uncertainties in the position and momentum of a particle is limited by
The particle may only occupy certain positive energy levels .
In quantum mechanics , however , the probability density for finding a particle at a given position is derived from the wavefunction as For the particle in a box , the probability density for finding the particle at a given position depends upon its state , and is given by
These quantum well systems are particularly important in optoelectronics , and are used in devices such as the quantum well laser , the quantum well infrared photodetector and the quantum-confined Stark effect modulator .
However , infinitely large forces repel the particle if it touches the walls of the box , preventing it from escaping .
The energy levels increase with , meaning that high energy levels are separated from each other by a greater amount than low energy levels are .
Additionally , it is more likely to be found at certain positions than at others , depending on its energy level .
For example the wavefunction with has the same energy as the wavefunction with .
In quantum mechanics , the particle in a box model -LRB- also known as the infinite potential well or the infinite square well -RRB- describes a particle free to move in a small space surrounded by impenetrable barriers .
It can be shown that the uncertainty in the position of the particle is proportional to the width of the box .
Thus , for any value of n greater than one , there are regions within the box for which , indicating that spatial nodes exist at which the particle can not be found .
This situation is called degeneracy and for the case where exactly two degenerate wavefunctions have the same energy that energy level is said to be doubly degenerate .
If a particle is trapped in a two-dimensional box , it may freely move in the and - directions , between barriers separated by lengths and respectively .
where is the reduced Planck constant , is the mass of the particle , is the imaginary unit and is time .
This contrasts with classical systems , where the particle can have zero energy by resting motionless at the bottom of the box .
Because of its mathematical simplicity , the particle in a box model is used to find approximate solutions for more complex physical systems in which a particle is trapped in a narrow region of low electric potential between two high potential barriers .
The particle in a box model provides one of the very few problems in quantum mechanics which can be solved analytically , without approximations .
The walls of a one-dimensional box may be visualised as regions of space with an infinitely large potential .
Here , the particle may only move backwards and forwards along a straight line with impenetrable barriers at either end .
The wavefunction can be found by solving the SchrÃ dinger equation for the system
This means that the observable properties of the particle -LRB- such as its energy and position -RRB- are related to the mass of the particle and the width of the well by simple mathematical expressions .
The simplest form of the particle in a box model considers a one-dimensional system .
Thus , the uncertainty in momentum is roughly inversely proportional to the width of the box .
Conversely , the interior of the box has a constant , zero potential .
The potential in this model is given as
In classical physics , the particle can be detected anywhere in the box with equal probability .
where is the length of the box and is the position of the particle within the box .
However , when the well becomes very narrow -LRB- on the scale of a few nanometers -RRB- , quantum effects become important .

The kinetic energy of a particle is given by , and hence the minimum kinetic energy of the particle in a box is inversely proportional to the mass and the square of the well width , in qualitative agreement with the calculation above .
The lowest possible energy for the particle -LRB- its zero-point energy -RRB- is found in state 1 , which is given by
The particle , therefore , always has a positive energy .
The particle may never be detected at certain positions , known as spatial nodes .
Using a similar approach to that of the one-dimensional box , it can be shown that the wavefunctions and energies are given respectively by ,
, where the three-dimensional wavevector is given by .
This means that no forces act upon the particle inside the box and it can move freely in that region .
For the steady state particle in a box , it can be shown that the average position is always , regardless of the state of the particle .
Due to its simplicity , the model allows insight into quantum effects without the need for complicated mathematics .

British historian Perry Anderson &apos; s history of the term and its understanding , ` The Origins of Postmodernity &apos; , explains these apparent contradictions , and demonstrates the importance of `` Postmodernism &apos; &apos; as a category and a phenomenon in the analysis of contemporary culture .
Postmodernist ideas in philosophy and the analysis of culture and society expanded the importance of critical theory and has been the point of departure for works of literature , architecture , and design , as well as being visible in marketing \ / business and the interpretation of history , law and culture , starting in the late 20th century .
In 1949 the term was used to describe a dissatisfaction with modern architecture , leading to the postmodern architecture movement .
Postmodernism in architecture is marked by the re-emergence of surface ornament , reference to surrounding buildings in urban architecture , historical reference in decorative forms , and non-orthogonal angles .
Postmodernist thought is an intentional departure from modernist approaches that had previously been dominant .
While the term `` Postmodern &apos; &apos; and its derivatives are freely used , with some uses apparently contradicting others , those outside the academic milieu have described it as merely a buzzword that means nothing .

Algae -LRB- or ; singular alga , Latin for `` seaweed &apos; &apos; -RRB- are a large and diverse group of simple , typically autotrophic organisms , ranging from unicellular to multicellular forms , such as the giant kelps that grow to 65 meters in length .
Fossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago .
They are photosynthetic like plants , and `` simple &apos; &apos; because their tissues are not organized into the many distinct organs found in land plants .
Nearly all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the Cyanobacteria , and so produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis , unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria .
Though the prokaryotic cyanobacteria -LRB- commonly referred to as blue-green algae -RRB- were traditionally included as `` algae &apos; &apos; in older textbooks , many modern sources regard this as outdated as they are now considered to be bacteria .
The largest and most complex marine forms are called seaweeds .
All true algae therefore have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane and plastids bound in one or more membranes .
Some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus .
Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants , such as phyllids -LRB- leaves -RRB- and rhizoids in nonvascular plants , or leaves , roots , and other organs that are found in tracheophytes -LRB- vascular plants -RRB- .

Titus Aurelius Fulvus Boionius Arrius Antoninus -LRB- 19 September 86 â `` 7 March 161 -RRB- , commonly known as Antoninus or Antoninus Pius , was Roman Emperor from 138 to 161 .
Faustina was a beautiful woman , renowned for her wisdom .
This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations .
German historian Ernst Kornemann has had it in his RÃ mische Geschichte -LRB- 2 vols . , ed .
When Faustina died in 141 , Antoninus was greatly bereaved .
She spent her whole life caring for the poor and assisting the most disadvantaged Romans .
Having filled with more than usual success the offices of quaestor and praetor , he obtained the consulship in 120 ; he was next appointed by the Emperor Hadrian as one of the four proconsuls to administer Italia , then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as proconsul of Asia , probably during 134-135 .
There is more to this argument , given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus &apos; passing .
Kornemann &apos; s brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders .
He acquired much favor with the Emperor Hadrian , who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138 , after the death of his first adopted son Lucius Aelius , on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus , the son of his wife &apos; s brother , and Lucius , son of Aelius Verus , who afterwards became the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus .
After the longest reign since Augustus -LRB- surpassing Tiberius by a couple of months -RRB- , Antoninus died of fever at Lorium in Etruria , about twelve miles -LRB- 19 km -RRB- from Rome , on 7 March 161 , giving the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask the passwordâ &apos; &apos; `` aequanimitas &apos; &apos; -LRB- equanimity -RRB- .
As a private citizen between 110 and 115 , he married Annia Galeria Faustina the Elder .
by H. Bengtson , Stuttgart 1954 -RRB- that the reign of Antoninus comprised `` a succession of grossly wasted opportunities , &apos; &apos; given the upheavals that were to come .
Nevertheless , Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign , but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus -LRB- of which some were publicly displayed -RRB- .
They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage .
Faustina bore Antoninus four children , two sons and two daughters .

Nijinsky and Diaghilev became lovers for a time , and Diaghilev was heavily involved in directing and managing Nijinsky &apos; s career .
During this time , Nijinsky choreographed and danced the leading role in Till Eulenspiegel .
Nijinsky took the creative reins and choreographed ballets , which slew boundaries and stirred controversy .
Free from supervision , Nijinsky became acquainted with Romola de Pulszky , a Hungarian countess .
When the company returned to Europe Diaghilev is reported to have flown into a rage , culminating in Nijinsky &apos; s dismissal .
During World War I , Nijinsky was interned in Hungary .
He grew to be celebrated for his virtuosity and for the depth and intensity of his characterizations .
Unfortunately , Nijinsky &apos; s new trends in dance caused a riotous reaction at the ThÃ Ã cents tre de Champs - Ã lysÃ es when they premiered in Paris .
A turning point for Nijinsky was his meeting Sergei Diaghilev , a celebrated and highly innovative producer of ballet and opera as well as art exhibitions , who concentrated on promoting Russian visual and musical art abroad , particularly in Paris .

C-type asteroids are carbonaceous asteroids .
They are the most common variety forming around 75 % of known asteroids , and an even higher percentage in the outer part of the belt beyond 2.7 AU , which is dominated by this asteroid type .
This type of asteroid has very similar spectra to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites -LRB- types CI and CM -RRB- , whose chemical composition is approximately the same as the Sun and the primitive solar nebula , except that they do not contain hydrogen , helium and other volatiles .
Consequently , whereas a number of S-types can normally be viewed with binoculars at opposition , even the largest C-types require a small telescope .
The potentially brightest C-type asteroid is 324 Bamberga , but that object &apos; s very high eccentricity means it rarely reaches its maximum magnitude .
Hydrated -LRB- water-containing -RRB- minerals are present .
C-type asteroids are extremely dark with albedos typically in the 0.03 to 0.10 range .
The proportion of C-types may actually be greater than this , because C-types are much darker than most other asteroid types except D-types and others common only at the extreme outer edge of the Main Belt .
The largest unequivocally C-type asteroid is 10 Hygiea , although the SMASS classification places the largest asteroid 1 Ceres , here as well , because that scheme lacks a G-type .

Lone Tree is a city in southeastern Johnson County , Iowa , United States .
Given a connected , undirected graph , a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together . A single graph can have many different spanning trees .
The problem can also be approached in a distributed manner .
Its running time is O -LRB- m Î -LRB- m , n -RRB- -RRB- , where m is the number of edges , n is the number of vertices and Î is the classical functional inverse of the Ackermann function .
Its purpose was an efficient electrical coverage of Moravia .
There are now two algorithms commonly used , Prim &apos; s algorithm and Kruskal &apos; s algorithm .
A maximum spanning tree is a spanning tree with weight greater than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree .
The first algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree was developed by Czech scientist Otakar BorÅ vka in 1926 -LRB- see BorÅ vka &apos; s algorithm -RRB- .
If each node is considered a computer and no node knows anything except its own connected links , one can still calculate the distributed minimum spanning tree .
We can also assign a weight to each edge , which is a number representing how unfavorable it is , and use this to assign a weight to a spanning tree by computing the sum of the weights of the edges in that spanning tree .
There may be several minimum spanning trees of the same weight having a minimum number of edges ; in particular , if all the edge weights of a given graph are the same , then every spanning tree of that graph is minimum .
The fastest non-randomized algorithm , by Bernard Chazelle , is based on the soft heap , an approximate priority queue .
There may be several minimum spanning trees of the same weight having a minimum number of edges ; in particular , if all the edge weights of a given graph are the same , then every spanning tree of that graph is minimum . If there are n vertices in the graph , then each tree has n-1 edges .
The function Î grows extremely slowly , so that for all practical purposes it may be considered a constant no greater than 4 ; thus Chazelle &apos; s algorithm takes very close to linear time .
Alpay Fehmi Ã -- zalan -LRB- born 29 May 1973 -RRB- is a former Turkish footballer .
It was first described under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in Arthur Phillip &apos; s Voyage to Botany Bay , published in 1789 .
It is also the second-largest extant bird in the world by height , after its ratite relative , the ostrich .
The species was named by ornithologist John Latham on a specimen from the Sydney , Australia area , which was referred to as New Holland at the time .
The etymology of the common name Emu is uncertain , but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird that was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in Australia and New Guinea .
Emus are farmed for their meat , oil , and leather .
He collaborated on Phillip &apos; s book and provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species ; its name is Latin for `` fast-footed New Hollander &apos; &apos; .
Once common on the east coast , Emu are now uncommon ; by contrast , the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the Emu in arid regions , and it is neither endangered nor vulnerable .
In Victoria , some terms for the Emu were Barrimal in the Dja Dja Wurrung language , myoure in Gunai , and courn in Jardwadjali .
The Emu -LRB- Dromaius novaehollandiae -RRB- is the largest bird native to Australia and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius .

The discovery of primitive , dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view ; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small , bipedal predators .
There is a wide consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs . Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural , birds would thus be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are , therefore , not extinct .
Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late Triassic period , roughly 20 million years after the Permianâ `` Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95 % of all life on Earth . Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time .
Paleontologists believe Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs ; if this is true , its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small , bipedal predators .
Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals that were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for over 160 million years , from the late Triassic period -LRB- about 230 million years ago -RRB- until the end of the Cretaceous -LRB- about 65 million years ago -RRB- .

In 1887 , the Order was divided into the two classes of Knights Commander -LRB- 50 at any given time -RRB- and Companions -LRB- no quota -RRB- .
The British authorities intended the Order of the Indian Empire as a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India -LRB- founded in 1861 -RRB- ; consequently , many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter .
The Orders have never been formally abolished , and Queen Elizabeth II remains the Sovereign of the Orders to this day .
No appointments have been made since 1947 , the year of the Partition of India .
Members of the first class were known as `` Knights Grand Commanders &apos; &apos; rather than `` Knights Grand Cross &apos; &apos; so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the Order .
Generally , the rulers of the more important states were appointed Knights Grand Commanders of the Order of the Star of India , rather than of the Order of the Indian Empire .
As well , other Asian and Middle Eastern rulers were also appointed .
With the death of the last surviving knight , The Maharaja of Dhrangadhra , the order became dormant in 2010 .

At the time of foundation in 1878 the order had only one class , that of Companion , with no quota imposed .
Today , there are no living members of the order .
The Order is the junior British order of chivalry associated with the Empire of India ; the senior one is The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India .
The Grand Master held the next-most senior rank ; the position was held , ex officio , by the Viceroy of India .
Female princely rulers were , oddly , admitted as `` Knights &apos; &apos; rather than as `` Dames &apos; &apos; or `` Ladies &apos; &apos; .
The following year the class of Knight Grand Commander -LRB- 25 at any given time -RRB- was added ; the composition of the other two classes remained the same .
Women , save the princely rulers , were ineligible for appointment to the Order .
The motto of the Order is Imperatricis auspiciis , -LRB- Latin for `` Under the auspices of the Empress &apos; &apos; -RRB- , a reference to Queen Victoria , the first Empress of India .
The Order includes members of three classes :

The estimated number of Serbs killed in Jasenovac ranges from 25,000 to 700,000 .
Some former priests , mostly Franciscans , particularly in , but not limited to , Herzegovina and Bosnia , took part in the atrocities themselves .
Serbs , Jews , Roma and Croatian anti-fascists , including Communist Croats and dissident Croat Byzantine Catholic priests , were interned in concentration camps , the largest of which was the Jasenovac complex , where many were killed by UstaÅ e militia .
The first group of camps was formed in the spring of 1941 .
During World War II , various German military commanders gave different figures for the number of Serbs , Jews and others killed on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia .

The HSS was banned on 11 June 1941 , in an attempt by the UstaÅ e to take their place as the primary representative of the Croatian peasantry .
UstaÅ e activities in villages across the Dinaric Alps led to the Italians and the Germans expressing disquiet .
Vladko MaÄ ek , the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party -LRB- HSS -RRB- which was the most influential party in Croatia at the time , rejected German offers to lead the new government .
The UstaÅ e never recognized the existence of a Serb people on the territories of Croatia or Bosnia - they recognized only `` Croats of the Eastern faith . &apos; &apos;
The most reliable figures place the number of Serbs killed by the UstaÅ a between 330,000 and 390,000 , with 45,000 to 52,000 Serbs murdered in Jasenovac .

They also publicly announced the strategy to achieve their goal :
The UstaÅ e regime had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from Serbian and Jewish property owners during World War II into Swiss bank accounts .
However , Archbishop Stepinac also said this on 28 March 1941 , noting Yugoslavia &apos; s early attempts to unite Croatians and Serbs : `` All in all , Croats and Serbs are of two worlds , northpole and southpole , never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God .

After World War II , the remaining UstaÅ e went underground or fled to countries such as Canada , Australia , Germany and South America , with the assistance of Roman Catholic churches and their grassroots supporters Some of them persisted in their crusade against Yugoslavia .
These six camps were closed by October 1942 .
MaÄ ek issued a statement that day , calling on all Croatians to co-operate with the new authorities .
Writers Vladimir Nazor and Ivan Goran KovaÄ iÄ escaped from UstaÅ e-held territory to join the Partisans , and were followed by others .
Thus , UstaÅ e ministers Mile Budak , Mirko Puk , and Milovan Å 1 \ / 2 aniÄ declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new UstaÅ e policy was an ethnically clean Croatia .
The UstaÅ e held the position that Eastern Orthodoxy , as a symbol of Serbian nationalism , was their greatest foe .
De facto control over this territory varied for the majority of the war , as the Partisans grew more successful , while the Germans and Italians increasingly exercised direct control over areas of interest .
Here there is no moral , no principles , no truth , no justice , no honesty . &apos; &apos;
Infighting over the failure to establish a Croatian state also fragmented the surviving UstaÅ e . Ante PaveliÄ formed the Croatian Liberation Movement which drew several of the former state &apos; s leaders .

In 1943 , the Germans suffered major losses on the Eastern Front and the Italians signed an armistice with the Allies , leaving behind significant armaments that the Partisans used against the occupiers and the UstaÅ e . Fighting continued for a short while after the formal surrender of German Army Group E on 9 May 1945 , as Axis forces and many refugees attempted to escape to Austria .

Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of twelve dwarves , who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug .
In the first edition of The Hobbit , Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game , and he and Bilbo part amicably . In the second edition edits , in order to reflect the new concept of the ring and its corrupting abilities , Tolkien made Gollum more aggressive towards Bilbo and distraught at losing the ring .
The expedition travel to the Mountain and find the secret door ; Bilbo scouts the dragon &apos; s lair , stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug &apos; s armor .
For example , Gollum &apos; s riddles are taken from old historical sources , while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books . It is the form of the riddle game , familiar to both , which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other , rather than the content of the riddles themselves .
Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies .
Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a story for children , and The Lord of the Rings for the same audience , who had subsequently grown up since its publication . Some differences are in minor details ; for example , goblins are more often referred to as Orcs in The Lord of the Rings .

Blood can leave the erectile tissue only through a drainage system of veins around the outside wall of the corpus cavernosum .
The two corpora cavernosa lie along the penis shaft , from the pubic bones to the head of the penis , where they join .
The corpus cavernosum penis is one of a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue which contain most of the blood in the penis during penile erection .
The penis becomes rigid as a result .
The expanding spongy tissue presses against a surrounding dense tissue -LRB- tunica albuginea -RRB- constricting these veins , preventing blood from leaving .

Philosophy of mind is a branch of modern analytic philosophy that studies the nature of the mind , mental events , mental functions , mental properties , consciousness and their relationship to the physical body , particularly the brain .
These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of RenÃ Descartes .
The mind-body problem , i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body , is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind , although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body .
Someone &apos; s desire for a slice of pizza , for example , will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants .
The mind-body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds , or mental processes , and bodily states or processes .
The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states \ / processes , and howâ &apos; &apos; or even ifâ &apos; &apos; minds are affected by and can affect the body .
The question , then , is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties .
A related problem is to explain how someone &apos; s propositional attitudes -LRB- e.g. beliefs and desires -RRB- can cause that individual &apos; s neurons to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner .
Human perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at one &apos; s various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in one &apos; s mental state , ultimately causing one to feel a sensation , which may be pleasant or unpleasant .

American physician and humanitarian John Gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 with the purpose of cooling air .
One day in 1928 , while walking through some woods collecting sap for maple syrup , Copeman noticed that slush and ice flaked off his rubber boots rather than adhering to them .
Some novelty trays produce blocks of ice in seasonal , festive or other shapes .
The first rubber ice cube tray was invented by Lloyd Groff Copeman .
The first flexible stainless steel , all-metal ice cube tray was created by Guy L. Tinkham in 1933 .
Ice cubes are also produced commercially and sold in bulk ; these ice cubes , despite their name , are often cylindrical , and may have holes through the center . An interesting characteristic of commercially made ice cubes is that they are completely clear , lacking the clouding found in the center of domestically made ice cubes .
Later , he set about designing and then patenting different types of tray : a metal tray with rubber separators , a metal tray with individual rubber cups , and a tray made completely of rubber .
Ice cubes are small , roughly cube-shaped pieces of ice , conventionally used to cool beverages .
Gorrie can be considered the creator of ice cubes , even though his aim was not to cool drinks .
Therefore , in order to help treat sickness , he pushed for the draining of swamps and the cooling of sickrooms .
Rather , he used the ice to cool the ambient room temperature .
An alternative system is an aluminum tray with a lever that raises the ice cubes , freeing them from the tray .
Ice cube trays are designed to be filled with water , then placed in a freezer until the water freezes to ice , producing ice cubes .
A motorized version of this is found in most automatic ice-making freezers .
The tray bent sideways to remove the ice cubes .
These are commonly referred to as ice tubes .
Ice cubes are produced domestically by filling an ice cube tray with water and placing it in a freezer .
His refrigerator produced ice which he hung from the ceiling in a basin .
Crushed ice is also used when faster cooling is desired , since the rate of cooling is governed by the number and average radius of the ice particles .
Many freezers also come equipped with an icemaker , which produces ice cubes automatically and stores them in a bin from which they can be dispensed directly into a glass .
An interesting characteristic of commercially made ice cubes is that they are completely clear , lacking the clouding found in the center of domestically made ice cubes .
Ice cubes are often preferred over crushed ice because they melt more slowly ; they are standard in mixed drinks that call for ice , in which case the drink is said to be `` on the rocks . &apos; &apos;
Ice cubes are also produced commercially and sold in bulk ; these ice cubes , despite their name , are often cylindrical , and may have holes through the center .
Having recalled this incident over lunch with his patent attorney , he conducted experiments using rubber cups .
Trays are often flexible , so the frozen cubes can be easily removed by flexing the tray .

Display in Julian or Chinese calendar date is possible using parameter 2 .
Other 3 digit years may be misinterpreted as well , so best practice is to use leading zeros to make a 4 digit year for this date range .
It is very unusual for people to mention such dates so long ago , so when we really mean this date , we must specify a 4 digit date .
Most time zone abbreviations as well as a large number of place names are recognized .
Instead , use `` February 0274 &apos; &apos; .
If time zone or location is missing , the local time of the event discussed in the article is assumed .
The user of course may express the display form in the second parameter however they would like .
`` Fuzzy &apos; &apos; dates and times are supported .
Background : There is a good rationale for the behavior of the system function which actually does the hard work of this template .
These changes will not affect display , but for those curious , this is the rationale for such bot manipulations .
These templates are an alternative to the \ / and \ / templates that also emit microformats but require dates to be expressed in standard , unambiguous and international ISO syntax .
BCE -LRB- required for BCE dates -RRB- set to yes if the date is BC .
Authors may specify place names -LRB- see list -RRB- or time zones such as EDT , PST , HST and so on and these will be properly adjusted to UTC -LRB- Coordinated Universal Time -RRB- for transfer to other applications via microformat encoding .
timezone -LRB- required if timezone information specified -RRB- Set to yes if the time is UTC or if the location , timezone , or timezone offset is specified .
Gregorian calendar dates are required .
-LRB- See recognized timezone values table . -RRB-
For the years 99 BC to 99AD especially , microformats may not be emitted properly unless expressed in the form YYYY-MM-DD .
If year is absent , the current year is assumed .
See timezone parameter if UTC time is desired .
For users uninterested in microformats , it should be noted that this restriction has no known impacts other than microformat data which are currently invisible to users .
parameter 1 -LRB- required -RRB- The date and time to display and to emit as a microformat date .
ISO8601 -LRB- optional -RRB- if present , this ISO8601 date \ / time value is emitted instead of the value derived from parameter 1 .
Time zones are assumed to be local to the event .
For events where the precise time , day or month is not known , the user may omit these details .
For example , February 274 will be interpreted as February 27 , 2004 .
Start-date -LRB- birth-date -RRB- and end-date -LRB- death-date -RRB- are easy to read `` plain text &apos; &apos; date and time templates that emit microformat dates for events .
Bot runs may make a conversion of non 4 digit years to 4 digits -LRB- with leading zeros -RRB- in order to refine Wikipedia &apos; s quality of microformat dates .
Example : 1-2-3 is interpreted as February 3 , 1 A. D , and emitted in that form via microformats when the user may have intended something else .
Outside of this period with ambiguous years , users may use free text dates without this restriction .
If hour , or minutes are missing , zero is assumed .
-LRB- short form tz -RRB-
If day is missing , the first of the month is assumed .
If time zone information is specified , the otherwise optional timezone parameter must be set .

Charles Darwin wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of On the Origin of Species : `` Passing over ... Buffon , with whose writings I am not familiar . &apos; &apos;
Buffon held the position of intendant -LRB- director -RRB- at the Jardin du Roi , now called the Jardin des Plantes ; it is the French equivalent of Kew Gardens .
On this basis , he is sometimes considered a `` transformist &apos; &apos; and a precursor of Darwin .
He was the founder of biogeography .
But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods , and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species , I need not here enter on details . &apos; &apos;
He was the first person to discuss a large number of evolutionary problems , problems that before Buffon had not been raised by anybody ... he brought them to the attention of the scientific world .
He also suggested that the earth originated much earlier than 4004 BC , the date famously determined by Archbishop James Ussher .
In the opening volumes of the Histoire naturelle Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics , criticized Carl Linnaeus &apos; s taxonomical approach to natural history , outlined a history of the earth with little relation to the Biblical account , and proposed a theory of reproduction that ran counter to the prevailing theory of pre-existence .
In the course of his examination of the animal world , Buffon noted that despite similar environments , different regions have distinct plants and animals , a concept later known as Buffon &apos; s Law , widely considered the first principle of biogeography .
And yet , he hindered evolution by his frequent endorsement of the immutability of species .
Then , from the fourth edition onwards , he amended this to say that `` the first author who in modern times has treated it -LRB- evolution -RRB- in a scientific spirit was Buffon .
In Les Ã poques de la nature -LRB- 1778 -RRB- Buffon discussed the origins of the solar system , speculating that the planets had been created by a comet &apos; s collision with the sun .
Georges-Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon -LRB- 7 September 1707 â `` 16 April 1788 -RRB- was a French naturalist , mathematician , cosmologist , and encyclopedic author .
Basing his figures on the cooling rate of iron tested at his Laboratory le Petit Fontenet at Montbard , he calculated that the age of the earth was 75,000 years .
He developed a concept of the `` unity of type , &apos; &apos; a precursor of comparative anatomy .
In volume 14 , in particular , he argued that all the world &apos; s quadrupeds had developed from an original set of just thirty-eight quadrupeds .
He brought the idea of evolution into the realm of science .
He was not an evolutionist , yet he was the father of evolutionism .
More than anyone else , he was responsible for the acceptance of a long-time scale for the history of the earth .
It has been said that `` Truly , Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century . &apos; &apos;

Upon Arnold &apos; s death in 1473 , Duke Charles added Guelders to his Burgundian Netherlands .
The duchy was named after the town of Geldern -LRB- Gelder -RRB- in present-day Germany .
At the Treaty of Utrecht , ending the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 , the Spanish Upper Quarter was again divided between Prussian Guelders -LRB- Geldern , Viersen , Horst , Venray -RRB- , the United Provinces -LRB- Venlo , Montfort , Echt -RRB- , Austria -LRB- Roermond , NiederkrÃ 1 \ / 4 chten , Weert -RRB- , and the Duchy of JÃ 1 \ / 4 lich -LRB- Erkelenz -RRB- .
After the line became extinct in 1371 , William I of JÃ 1 \ / 4 lich inherited Guelders and from 1393 onwards held both duchies in personal union .
However , its territory did not only grow because of its success in warfare , but it also thrived in times of peace .
However neither of them were able to repay their debts , so these lands became integral parts of Guelders .
In 1423 Guelders passed to the House of Egmond , who even reached the recognition by Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg .
Guelders or Gueldres -LRB- Dutch : Gelre , German : Geldern -RRB- is the name of a historical county , later duchy of the Holy Roman Empire , located in the Low Countries .
Duke Adolf however , stuck in a fierce inheritance conflict with his father Arnold , soon came under pressure from the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold , who had him captured and imprisoned in 1471 .
The coat of arms of the region evolved during the ages .
It was then located on the territory of Lower Lorraine , in the area of Geldern and Roermond , with its main stronghold at Montfort -LRB- built 1260 -RRB- .
The county emerged about 1096 , when Gerard III of Wassenberg was first documented as `` Count of Guelders &apos; &apos; .
In the 12th and 13th century , Guelders quickly expanded downstream along the sides of the Maas , Rhine , and IJssel rivers and even claimed the succession in the Duchy of Limburg , until it lost the 1288 Battle of Worringen against Berg and Brabant .
This article deals with the historical county and duchy of Guelders , for other meanings see Gelderland .
Though the present province of Gelderland -LRB- English also Guelders -RRB- in the Netherlands occupies most of the area , the former duchy also comprised parts of the actual Dutch province of Limburg as well as those territories in the present-day German state of North Rhine-Westphalia that were acquired by Prussia in 1713 .
In 1339 Count Reginald II of Guelders was elevated to the rank of a duke by Emperor Louis IV of Wittelsbach .
Guelders was often at war with its neighbors , not only with Brabant , but also with the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht .
He bequested the duchy to Duke William the Rich of JÃ 1 \ / 4 lich-Cleves-Berg , who however was not able to hold on to it and Emperor Charles V of Habsburg soon moved in .
Count Gerard &apos; s son Gerard II in 1127 acquired the County of Zutphen in northern Hamaland by marriage .
When the northern Netherlands revolted against King Philip II of Spain in the Dutch Revolt , the three northern quarters of Gelderland joined the Union of Utrecht and became part of the United Provinces upon the 1581 Act of Abjuration , while only the Upper Quarter remained a part of the Spanish Netherlands .
On separate occasions the bishop of Utrecht gave the Veluwe and William II , who was count of both Holland and Zeeland and who was elected anti-king of the Holy Roman Empire -LRB- 1248-1256 -RRB- , gave Nijmegen in use to Guelders in return of a loan .
The last independent Duke of Guelders was Adolf &apos; s son Charles of Egmond -LRB- 1492-1538 -RRB- , who , backed by France , expanded his realm further north , to incorporate what is now the Province of Overijssel .
Charles V abdicated in 1556 and decreed that the territories of the Burgundian Circle should be held by the Spanish Crown .
Guelders finally lost its independence , when it was united with the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands in 1543 .

In another common situation , if an object hits a surface with some speed , and the surface can withstand it , the normal force provides for a rapid deceleration , which will depend on the flexibility of the surface .

Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth Macroglossum stellatarum which usually pollinates many popular garden flowers like Petunia , Zinnia , Dianthus and others .
Gladiolus -LRB- from Latin , the diminutive of gladius , a sword -RRB- is a genus of perennial bulbous flowering plants in the iris family -LRB- Iridaceae -RRB- .
About 10 species are native to Eurasia .
These flowers are variously colored , pink to reddish or light purple with white , contrasting markings , or white to cream or orange to red .
The outer three tepals are narrower .
There are 160 species of Gladiolus endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa .
The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section .
The spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce are the products of centuries of hybridisation , selection , and perhaps more drastic manipulation .
In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color .
The genus Gladiolus contains about 260 species , of which 250 are native to sub-Saharan Africa , mostly South Africa .
The style has three filiform , spoon-shaped branches , each expanding towards the apex .
Their stems are generally unbranched , producing 1 to 9 narrow , sword-shaped , longitudinal grooved leaves , enclosed in a sheath .
The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance , and are termed tepals .
Sometimes called the sword lily , the most widely used English common name for these plants is simply gladiolus -LRB- plural gladioli , gladioluses or sometimes gladiolas -RRB- .
They grow from rounded , symmetrical corms , that are enveloped in several layers of brownish , fibrous tunics .
Actually , They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps .
The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees , but some changes in the pollination system have occurred , allowing pollination by sunbirds , noctuid and sphingid moths , long-tongued flies and several others .
The ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules , containing many , winged brown , longitudinally dehiscent seeds .
These attractive , perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates .
The dorsal tepal is the largest , arching over the three stamens .
These seeds are unable to germinate .
They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure .
In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps .
The perianth is funnel-shaped , with the stamens attached to its base .
In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat .
The fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided , with secund , bisexual flowers , each subtended by 2 leathery , green bracts .
The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll .
Gladioli are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Large Yellow Underwing .
The color and rich taste of the milk can be attributed to the high oil content and sugars .
Depending on the brand and age of the milk itself , a thicker , more paste-like consistency floats to the top of the can , and is sometimes separated and used in recipes that require coconut cream rather than coconut milk .
Two grades of coconut milk exist : thick and thin .
Coconut milk is a sweet , milky white cooking base derived from the meat of a mature coconut .
The term coconut milk is not the same as coconut water -LRB- coconut juice -RRB- , which is the naturally-occurring liquid found inside the hollow coconut .
Grainville-Langannerie is a commune in the Calvados department in the Basse-Normandie region in northwestern France .
When a tornadic waterspout makes landfall it is reclassified as a tornado , which can subsequently cause damage to areas inland of the coast .
When a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it quickly dissipates as it loses the inflow of warm air into the vortex .
Landfall is distinct from a direct hit . A direct hit is where the core of high winds -LRB- or eyewall -RRB- comes onshore but the center of the storm may stay offshore .
These coupled with high surf can cause major beach erosion .
When a tropical cyclone makes landfall , the eye closes in upon itself due to the weakening process , which causes surf to decrease .
In low lying areas , the storm surge can stay inland for a long time and mix with chemicals already in the area to create a toxic mess .
Landfall is the event of a tropical cyclone -LRB- also known as a hurricane -RRB- or a waterspout coming onto land after being over water .

However , the following year , a detachment of soldiers from Britain -LRB- they had been drafted to Italy to suppress brigands -RRB- also denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor -LRB- they had been enabled to do so by Cleander , who was seeking to dispose of his rival -RRB- , and Commodus gave them permission to execute him as well as his wife and sons .
On 31 December Marcia poisoned his food but he vomited up the poison ; so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner Narcissus to strangle him in his bath .
Early in 188 , Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect , Atilius Aebutianus , and himself took over supreme command of the Praetorians at the new rank of a pugione -LRB- `` dagger-bearer &apos; &apos; -RRB- with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him .
In December he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January .
Priscus refused to accept their acclamations , but Perennis had all the legionary legates in Britain cashiered .
Later , he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart and afterwards carried the bleeding head of the dead bird and his sword over to the section where the Senators sat and gesticulated as though they were next .
He also ruled as co-emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius from 177 until his father &apos; s death in 180 .
The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions : Aufidius Victorinus committed suicide .
Four of his sisters were considerably older than he ; the eldest , Lucilla , held the rank of Augusta as the widow of her first husband , Lucius Verus .
He also had the head of the Colossus of Nero adjacent to the Colosseum replaced with his own portrait , gave it a club and placed a bronze lion at its feet to make it look like Hercules , and added an inscription boasting of being `` the only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men &apos; &apos; .
In the view of Dio Cassius , a contemporary observer , his accession marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; a famous comment which has led some historians , notably Edward Gibbon , to take Commodus &apos; s reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire .
The first crisis of the reign came in 182 , when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother .
At the outset of his reign , Commodus , aged 19 , inherited many of his father &apos; s senior advisers , notably Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus -LRB- the second husband of Commodus &apos; s sister Lucilla -RRB- , his father-in-law Gaius Bruttius Praesens , Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio , and Aufidius Victorinus , who was Prefect of the City of Rome .
Thus , these public fights would not end in a death .
Commodus took the loss of Saoterus badly , and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy , one apparently led by Publius Salvius Julianus , who was the son of the jurist Salvius Julianus and was betrothed to Paternus &apos; s daughter .
The emperor also had a passion for gladiatorial combat , which he took so far as to take to the arena himself , dressed as a gladiator .
Citizens of Rome missing their feet through accident or illness were taken to the arena , where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants .
As a result , Commodus appeared even more rarely in public , preferring to live on his estates .
Perennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favorite in Cleander , a Phrygian freedman who had married one of the emperor &apos; s mistresses , Demostratia .
At this point , the prefect Laetus formed a conspiracy with Eclectus to supplant Commodus with Pertinax , taking Marcia into their confidence .
One of the ways he paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order , and on many inscriptions , the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state , the Senate and People -LRB- Senatus Populusque Romanus -RRB- is provocatively reversed -LRB- Populus Senatusque ... -RRB- .
Also , in Britain in 184 , the governor Ulpius Marcellus re-advanced the Roman frontier northward to the Antonine Wall , but the legionaries revolted against his harsh discipline and acclaimed another legate , Priscus , as emperor .
In the spring of 190 , Rome was afflicted by a food shortage , for which the praefectus annonae Papirius Dionysius , the official actually in charge of the grain supply , contrived to lay the blame on Cleander .
He also had five surviving sisters , all of them with husbands who were potential rivals .
It was rumored that he was actually the son , not of Marcus , but of a gladiator whom his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of Caieta .
In November 192 , Commodus held Plebian Games in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning , and fought as a gladiator every afternoon , naturally winning all the bouts .
In the arena , Commodus always won since his opponents always submitted to the emperor .
In 187 , one of the leaders of the deserters , Maternus , came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March , but he was betrayed and executed .
For each appearance in the arena , he charged the city of Rome a million sesterces , straining the Roman economy .
Unrest around the empire increased , with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in Gaul and Germany .
These acts may have contributed to his assassination .
Commodus &apos; s death marked the end of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty .
Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus -LRB- 31 August 161 â `` 31 December 192 -RRB- was Roman Emperor from 180 to 192 .
Whereas the reign of Marcus Aurelius had been marked by almost continuous warfare , even though he preferred books over war , that of Commodus was comparatively peaceful in the military sense but was marked by political strife and the increasingly arbitrary and capricious behavior of the emperor himself .
Pompeianus retired from public life .
Privately , it was his custom to slay his practice opponents .
At the urging of his mistress Marcia , Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed .
According to Dio Cassius , Perennis , though ruthless and ambitious , was not personally corrupt and generally administered the state well .
The Romans found Commodus &apos; naked gladiatorial combats to be scandalous and disgraceful .
Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus .
According to Gibbon , Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day .
Thus he presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire and Roman life and religion .
One of the two praetorian prefects , Tarrutenius Paternus , had actually been involved in the conspiracy but was not detected at this time , and in the aftermath , he and his colleague Sextus Tigidius Perennis were able to arrange for the murder of Saoterus , the hated chamberlain .
His accession as emperor was the first time a son had succeeded his father since Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79 .
Commodus was succeeded by Pertinax , whose reign was short lived , being the first to fall victim to the Year of the Five Emperors .
Pescennius Niger mopped up the deserters in Gaul in a military campaign , and a revolt in Brittany was put down by two legions brought over from Britain .
Now at the zenith of his power , Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business .
Commodus &apos; statues were thrown down .
Quadratus and Quintianus were executed ; Lucilla was exiled to Capri and later killed .
Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as governor of Britain by Pertinax ; brought to Rome and tried for treason , Marcellus narrowly escaped death .
Her motive is alleged to have been envy of the Empress Crispina .
Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus , Commodus &apos; s cousin Annia Fundania Faustina , and his brother-in-law Mamertinus .
Marcia , the widow of Quadratus , who had been executed in 182 , is alleged to have been a Christian .
The emperor now changed his name to Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus and , at 29 , took over more of the reins of power , though he continued to rule through a cabal consisting of Marcia , his new chamberlain Eclectus , and the new praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus , who about this time also had many Christians freed from working in the mines in Sardinia .
Upon his death , the Senate declared him a public enemy -LRB- a de facto damnatio memoriae -RRB- and restored the original name to the city of Rome and its institutions .
On another occasion , Commodus killed three elephants on the floor of the arena by himself .
The climax came in the year 190 , which had 25 suffect consulsâ &apos; &apos; a record in the 1,000-year history of the Roman consulshipâ &apos; &apos; all appointed by Cleander -LRB- they included the future Emperor Septimius Severus -RRB- .
Often , wounded soldiers and amputees would be placed in the arena for Commodus to slay with a sword .
They bungled the job and were seized by the emperor &apos; s bodyguard .
Commodus was the first emperor `` born in the purple &apos; &apos; ; i.e. , born during his father &apos; s reign .
During 191 , the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days , during which many public buildings including the Temple of Pax , the Temple of Vesta and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed .
At the end of June , a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the Circus Maximus : he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances , but Pertinax , who was now City Prefect of Rome , dispatched the Vigiles Urbani to oppose them .
Commodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena , often to the horror of the Roman people .
Finally , Commodus killed a giraffe which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast .
On 15 October 184 at the Capitoline Games , a Cynic philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus , who was watching , but was immediately put to death .
Papirius Dionysius was executed too .
Cleander fled to Commodus , who was at Laurentum in the house of the Quinctilii , for protection , but the mob followed him calling for his head .
Her husband , Pompeianus , was not involved , but two men alleged to have been her lovers , Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus -LRB- the consul of 167 , who was also her first cousin -RRB- and Appius Claudius Quintianus , attempted to murder Commodus as he entered the theater .

Sometimes , serfs served as soldiers in the event of conflict and could earn freedom or even ennoblement for valor in combat .
On the other hand , if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land , the serf or serfs associated with that land went with it to serve their new lord . Further , a serf could not abandon his lands without permission , nor could he sell them .
Before that time , Eastern Europe had been much more sparsely populated than Western Europe , and the lords of Eastern Europe created a peasantry-friendly environment to encourage migration east .
Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the Black Death epidemics , which not only stopped the migration but depopulated Western Europe .
In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to disappear west of the Rhine even as it spread through eastern Europe .
Serfdom reached Eastern European countries later than Western Europe â &apos; &apos; it became dominant around the 15th century .
Laws varied from country to country : in England a serf who made his way to a chartered town and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom .
On the other hand , if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land , the serf or serfs associated with that land went with it to serve their new lord .
Serfdom , indeed , was an institution that reflected a fairly common practice whereby great landlords were assured that others worked to feed them and were held down , legally and economically , while doing so .
Parts of Europe , including much of Scandinavia , never adopted many feudal institutions , including serfdom .
In Western Europe , the rise of powerful monarchs , towns , and an improving economy weakened the manorial system through the 13th and 14th centuries , and serfdom was rare following the Renaissance .
A manorial lord could not sell his serfs as a Roman might sell his slaves .
Serfdom remained in force in most of Russia until the Emancipation reform of 1861 , enacted on February 19 , 1861 , though in Russian Baltic provinces it had been abolished at the beginning of the 19th century .
This was one important cause for the deep differences between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe .
One rationale was that a serf `` worked for all , &apos; &apos; while a knight or baron `` fought for all &apos; &apos; and a churchman `` prayed for all &apos; &apos; ; thus everyone had a place .
Within his constraints , a serf had some freedom .
The word `` serf &apos; &apos; originated from the Middle French `` serf &apos; &apos; , and can be traced further back to the Latin servus , meaning `` slave &apos; &apos; .
At the same time , increasing unrest and uprisings by serfs and peasants , like Tylerâ s Rebellion in England in 1381 , put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to reform the system .
In other cases , serfs could purchase their freedom , be manumitted by their enlightened or generous owners , or flee to towns or newly-settled land where few questions were asked .
Russian serfdom was perhaps the most notable Eastern European institution , as it was never influenced by German law and migrations , and serfdom and the manorial system were enforced by the crown -LRB- Tsar -RRB- , not the nobility .
The demise of this empire , which had ruled much of western Europe for more than 200 years , was followed by a long period during which no strong central government existed in most of Europe .
However , medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century .
This arrangement provided most of the agricultural labor throughout the Middle Ages .
Their heirs were usually guaranteed an inheritance .
A well-to-do serf might even be able to buy his freedom .
Though the common wisdom is that a serf owned `` only his belly &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; even his clothes were the property , in law , of his lord â &apos; &apos; a serf might still accumulate personal property and wealth , and some serfs became wealthier than their free neighbors , although this was rather an exception to the general rule .
In some places , serfdom was merged with or exchanged for various forms of taxation .
Further , a serf could not abandon his lands without permission , nor could he sell them .

The climate of Colorado is quite complex compared to most of the United States .
The borders of Colorado were originally defined to be lines of latitude and longitude , making its shape a latitude-longitude quadrangle which stretches from 37 Â N to 41 Â N latitude and from 102 Â 03 &apos; W to 109 Â 03 &apos; W longitude -LRB- 25 Â W to 32 Â W from the Washington Meridian -RRB- .
Per capita personal income in 2007 was $ 41,192 , ranking Colorado eleventh in the nation .
The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the total state product in 2008 was $ 248.6 billion .
A main climatic division in Colorado occurs between the Rocky Mountains on the west and the plains on the east with the foothills forming a transitional zone between the two . Northeast , east , and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains , while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains , foothills , and mountains .
As of 2005 , Colorado has an estimated population of 4,665,177 , which is an increase of 63,356 , or 1.4 % , from the prior year and an increase of 363,162 , or 8.4 % , since the year 2000 .
Colorado , Wyoming and Utah are the only states which have boundaries defined solely by lines of latitude and longitude .
This includes a natural increase since the last census of 205,321 people -LRB- that is 353,091 births minus 147,770 deaths -RRB- and an increase due to net migration of 159,957 people into the state .
When placing the border markers for the Territory of Colorado , minor surveying errors resulted in several nearly imperceptible kinks , most notably along the border with the Territory of Utah . Once agreed upon by the Federal , state , and territorial governments , those surveyors &apos; benchmarks , became the legal boundaries for the Colorado Territory , kinks and all .
Current agricultural products are cattle , wheat , dairy products , corn , and hay .
Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 112,217 people , and migration within the country produced a net increase of 47,740 people .
Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate .

Before modern times the government of the Isle of Man was in the hands of the Governor -LRB- or Lieutenant Governor -RRB- , who was the representative of the Lord of Man , assisted by his Council , consisting of the other permanent officials -LRB- the Bishop , Archdeacon , Deemsters , Attorney General , etc . -RRB- .
The Departments and their functions are now as follows :
Finance and the police came under local control between 1958 and 1976 .
Created in 1985-87 , they were the successors of the former Boards of Tynwald .
Statutory boards and offices are listed below the Department to which they report .
Conflict between the House of Keys -LRB- popularly elected after 1866 -RRB- and the Lieutenant Governor came to a head during the tenure of Lord Raglan -LRB- 1902 â `` 18 -RRB- .
The Council evolved into the Legislative Council , the upper chamber of Tynwald , the parliament of the Isle of Man .
As noted above , a number of ` Statutory Boards &apos; and ` Commercial Boards &apos; were created at various times .
After the Revestment in 1765 the Lieutenant Governor and his officials were the agents of the British Government , and not democratically responsible to the Manx people .
These included the Board of Education -LRB- 1872 -RRB- , Highway Board -LRB- 1874 -RRB- , Asylums Board -LRB- 1888 -RRB- , Government Property Trustees -LRB- 1891 -RRB- and Local Government Board -LRB- 1894 -RRB- .
The structure of the Boards of Tynwald , along with other bodies variously called ` Statutory Boards &apos; and ` Commercial Boards &apos; , became increasingly unwieldy after the 1950s , and was eventually reformed in the 1980s , when a system of ` ministerial government &apos; was set up .
The departments all report directly to the Council of Ministers .
However , although direct taxation was levied by Tynwald , the Boards &apos; freedom of action before the 1960s was limited by the Lieutenant Governor &apos; s control of the Island &apos; s budget and his power to appoint certain of their members .
The executive head is the Chief Minister .
The formal head of the Isle of Man Government is the Lieutenant Governor , representing HM Queen Elizabeth II , Lord of Mann .
An Executive Council , chaired by him and including members of Tynwald , was established in 1949 , and gradually thereafter became the effective government of the Island .
This is somewhat more than 10 % of the population of the Island , and a full 23 % of the working population .
Some were subsumed in the Departments in 1985-1987 , but others continued as separate Statutory Boards after 1987 :
The Isle of Man Government is the government of the Isle of Man .
Douglas , the largest town on the Isle of Man is its capital and seat of government , where the Government offices and the parliament chambers -LRB- Tynwald -RRB- are located .
The Lieutenant Governor ceased to chair the Executive Council in 1980 , being replaced by a chairman elected by Tynwald , and the Council was reconstituted in 1985 to include the chairmen of the eight principal Boards ; in 1986 they were given the title ` Minister &apos; and the chairman was styled ` Chief Minister &apos; .
The structure and functions of the Departments were re-organised with effect from 1 April 2010 .
The Civil Service has more than 2000 employees and the total number of public sector employees including the Civil Service , teachers , nurses , police , etc is about 9000 people .
During the 19th century several bodies , which came to be known as ` Boards of Tynwald &apos; , were created to exercise functions under democratic control .
After World War I the Lieutenant Governor gradually ceded control to Tynwald , a process guided by the reports of commissions and other bodies in 1911 , 1959 and 1969 .
This does not include any military forces , as defense is the responsibility of the United Kingdom .
In 1990 the Council was renamed the ` Council of Ministers &apos; .
Until 1 April 2010 the Departments were as follows .
The existing Departments , except the Treasury and the Departments of Education and Home Affairs , were dissolved , and the Department of Education was renamed `` the Department of Education and Children &apos; &apos; .
The Government consists of nine departments , ten statutory boards and three offices all reporting to the Council of Ministers .

This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution , dubbed the `` Cambrian explosion &apos; &apos; .
However , complex , image-forming eyes evolved some 50 to 100 times â `` using many of the same proteins and genetic toolkits in their construction .
However , how this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organism &apos; s environment varies widely : eyes have a wide range of structures and forms , all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules .
Eyes show a wide range of adaptations to meet the requirements of the organisms which bear them .
One of the many hypotheses for `` causes &apos; &apos; of this diversification , the `` Light Switch &apos; &apos; theory of Andrew Parker holds that the evolution of eyes initiated an arms race that led to a rapid spate of evolution .
Eyes may vary in their acuity , the range of wavelengths they can detect , their sensitivity in low light levels , their ability to detect motion or resolve objects , and whether they can discriminate colors .
They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from .
Complex eyes appear to have first evolved within a few million years , in the rapid burst of evolution known as the Cambrian explosion .
Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena .
Certain components of the eye , such as the visual pigments , appear to have a common ancestry â `` that is , they evolved once , before the animals radiated .
Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes .
Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms .
At a cellular level , there appear to be two main `` designs &apos; &apos; of eyes , one possessed by the protostomes -LRB- molluscs , annelid worms and arthropods -RRB- , the other by the deuterostomes -LRB- chordates and echinoderms -RRB- .
The first fossils of eyes appeared during the lower Cambrian period -LRB- about -RRB- .
It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals .
Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms .
Since the fossil record , particularly of the Early Cambrian , is so poor , it is difficult to estimate the rate of eye evolution .
Simple modelling , invoking small mutations exposed to natural selection , demonstrates that a primitive optical sense organ based upon efficient photopigments could evolve into a complex human-like eye in approximately 400,000 years .
There is no evidence of eyes before the Cambrian , but a wide range of diversity is evident in the Middle Cambrian Burgess shale .
The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots &apos; &apos; .
The euglena &apos; s eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end .

Until 1996 similar two-tier systems existed in Scotland and Wales , but these have now been replaced by fully unitary systems .
A unitary system has existed in Northern Ireland since 1973 .
In Germany , kreisfreie Stadt is the equivalent term for a city which is responsible for the local and the Kreis -LRB- district -RRB- administrative level -LRB- the British counties having no directly corresponding counterpart in Germany -RRB- .
Typically unitary authorities cover towns or cities which are large enough to function independently of county or other regional administration .
A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government .
One should not confuse municipalities in provinces with no upper-level of local government as single-tier municipalities , as these are the only level of local government in that province .
This is opposed to the two-tier system of local government , which still exists in most of England , where local government functions are divided between county councils -LRB- the upper tier -RRB- and district councils .
Sometimes they consist of national sub-divisions which are distinguished from others in the same country by having no lower level of administration .
In the United Kingdom , `` unitary authorities &apos; &apos; are English or Welsh local authorities set up by the Local Government Act 1992 which form a single tier of local government , and are responsible for almost all local government functions within their areas .
More commonly referred to as single-tier municipalities , they exist as a single level of government in a province that otherwise has two levels of local government .

Partial reform of local government in England since 1995 has led to the creation of so-called ceremonial counties to which lord-lieutenants are now appointed .
Ceremonial counties may comprise combinations of county council areas and unitary authorities .
Local Government reform in England in 1965 led to the appointment of lieutenants to Greater London and Huntingdon and Peterborough , and the abolition of those of the County of London , Middlesex and Huntingdonshire .
The Local Government -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1973 replaced the counties with regions , and each region was to have one or more lord-lieutenants appointed .
They are unpaid , but receive minimal allowances for secretarial help , mileage allowance and a driver .
A more fundamental reform of local government throughout England and Wales -LRB- outside Greater London -RRB- created a new structure of metropolitan , non-metropolitan and Welsh counties in 1974 .
The head of the commission is the Lord Mayor of the City of London .
The Lieutenancies Act 1997 is the most recent piece of primary legislation dealing with Lieutenancies in England and includes the definitive list of the current areas used .
Both men and women are eligible for the post .
There is no uniform for a female lord-lieutenant , but there is a badge which can be worn on ceremonial occasions .
They are appointed for life , although the customary age of retirement is 75 and the sovereign may remove them .
The City of London was unaffected by changes introduced since 1882 .
The official title of the office at this time was His or Her Majesty &apos; s `` lieutenant for the county of x &apos; &apos; , but as almost all office-holders were peers they were referred to as `` lord lieutenant &apos; &apos; .
In 1996 Scottish regions and districts were abolished on further local government reorganisation , and since that date lord-lieutenants have been appointed to lieutenancy areas .
However , it was not until the threat of invasion by the forces of Spain in 1585 that lieutenants were appointed to all counties and counties corporate and became in effect permanent .
The title Lord Lieutenant is given to the British monarch &apos; s personal representatives in the United Kingdom , usually in a county or similar circumscription , with varying tasks throughout history .
It restated the combination of counties and county corporates as lieutenancy counties .
Since the local government re-organisation of 1996 in Wales , lord-lieutenants are now appointed to preserved counties .
He was commander of these forces , whose officers he appointed .
Section 218 of the Local Government Act 1972 that established the new system stated : `` Her Majesty shall appoint a lord-lieutenant for each county in England and Wales and for Greater London ... &apos; &apos; The Act appears to be the first statutory use of the term `` lord-lieutenant &apos; &apos; for lieutenants to counties .
The areas to which they were appointed approximated to the counties and were based and were defined in terms of the new local government districts .
Lieutenants were first appointed to a number of English historic counties by Henry VIII in the 1540s , when the military functions of the sheriff were handed over to him .
The office &apos; s creation dates from the Tudors .
Although some counties were left without lieutenants during the 1590s , following the defeat of the Spanish Armada , the office continued to exist , and was retained by James I even after the end of the war against Spain in 1604 .
The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was the head of the British administration in Ireland until the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922 .
As the sovereign &apos; s representative in his or her county , the lord-lieutenant remains non-political and does not hold office in any political party .
In England and Wales and in Ireland , the lord lieutenant was the principal officer of his county .
The uniform for a male vice lord-lieutenant and for deputy lieutenants is of a similar style , but with features to distinguish it from that of a lord-lieutenant .
He raised and was responsible for the efficiency of the local militia units of the county , and afterwards of the yeomanry , and volunteers .
The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 established County Territorial Force Associations , of which the lieutenant was to be head , styled president of the county association .
Usually a retired local notable , senior military officer , peer or business person is given the post honorarily .
In 1975 counties ceased to be used for local government purposes in Scotland .
Male lord-lieutenants receive an allowance for the ceremonial uniform , worn when receiving members of the royal family and on other formal occasions .
Male lord-lieutenants wear a dark blue uniform in the style of an Army No. 1 dress along with a cap and sword with a steel scabbard .
It has a Commission of Lieutenancy rather than a single lord-lieutenant .
Lieutenancies soon became more organised , probably in the reign of his successor Edward VI , their establishment being approved by the English parliament in 1550 .
Windisch is a municipality in the district of Brugg in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was a Roman Catholic , although his writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to Martin Luther &apos; s ideas .
This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name .
His most famous publication was the Nuremberg Chronicle , published in 1493 in German and Latin editions .
An image of the Indian rhinoceros , the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities , and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns , a piece of coral , some large fish fins , and a wooden weapon from the East Indies .
These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins &apos; &apos; .
On his return to Nuremberg in 1495 , DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer opened his own workshop -LRB- being married was a requirement for this -RRB- .
Very soon after his return to Nuremberg , on 7 July 1494 , at the age of 23 , DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was married to Agnes Frey following an arrangement made during his absence .
He wrote that Giovanni Bellini was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice .
A self-portrait , a drawing in silverpoint , is dated 1484 -LRB- Albertina , Vienna -RRB- â when I was a child , &apos; &apos; as his later inscription says .
In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo .
He left in 1490 , possibly to work under Martin Schongauer , the leading engraver of Northern Europe , but who died shortly before DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s arrival at Colmar in 1492 . It is unclear where DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer traveled in the intervening period , though it is likely that he went to Frankfurt and the Netherlands .
It contained an unprecedented 1,809 woodcut illustrations -LRB- with many repeated uses of the same block -RRB- by the Wolgemut workshop .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s first painted self-portrait -LRB- now in the Louvre -RRB- was painted at this time , probably to be sent back to his fiancÃ in Nuremberg .
This was the altar-piece known as the Adoration of the Virgin or the Feast of Rose Garlands .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was born on 21 May 1471 , third child and second son of his parents , who had between fourteen and eighteen children .
It is now thought unlikely that DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer cut any of the woodblocks himself ; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman .
He also continued to make images in watercolor and bodycolor -LRB- usually combined -RRB- , including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals , including his Young Hare -LRB- 1502 -RRB- and the Great Piece of Turf -LRB- 1503 , both also Albertina -RRB- .
By this time DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied .
During this period he also completed two woodcut series , the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin , both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series .
Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city , a center for publishing and many luxury trades .
He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany , eventually owning twenty-four printing-presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad .
In all these , DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer shows the objects in net .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer lost both of his parents during the next decade : his father died in 1502 and his mother died in 1513 .
In early 1506 , he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507 .
Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith , he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to Michael Wolgemut at the age of fifteen in 1486 .
Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time , with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art , in particular woodcuts for books .
He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year , and a little later , a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints .
Around 1503 â `` 1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the Life of the Virgin , which he did not finish for some years .
Despite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians , DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was back in Nuremberg by mid-1507 , and he remained in Germany until 1520 .
Other works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion , published first in 1511 , and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512 .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56 , leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florinsâ &apos; &apos; a considerable sum .
It is now a museum .
However , in 1513 and 1514 DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer created his three most famous engravings : The Knight , Death , and the Devil -LRB- 1513 , probably based on Erasmus &apos; s treatise ` Enichiridion militis Christiani &apos; -RRB- , St. Jerome in his Study , and the much-debated Melencolia I -LRB- both 1514 -RRB- .
There he saw `` the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; the Aztec treasure that HernÃ n CortÃ s had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico .
His well-known works include the Knight , Death , and the Devil -LRB- 1513 -RRB- , Saint Jerome in his Study -LRB- 1514 -RRB- and Melencolia I -LRB- 1514 -RRB- , which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation .
Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker -LRB- and amateur harpist -RRB- in the city .
After completing his term of apprenticeship , DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer followed the common German custom of taking Wanderjahreâ &apos; &apos; in effect gap yearâ &apos; &apos; in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas ; DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer was to spend about four years away .
It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor Rudolf II and taken to Prague .
Other paintings DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer produced in Venice include The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch , Christ disputing with the Doctors -LRB- supposedly produced in a mere five days -RRB- , and a number of smaller works .
After a few years of school , DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer made large numbers of preparatory drawings , especially for his paintings and engravings , and many survive , most famously the Betende HÃ nde -LRB- engl . Praying Hands , c . 1508 Albertina , Vienna -RRB- , a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece .
Neither these , nor the Great Passion , were published as sets until several years later , but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers .
It had strong links with Italy , especially Venice , a relatively short distance across the Alps .
However , his training in Wolgemut &apos; s studio , which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut , evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce , and how to work with block cutters .
The Venetian artist Jacopo de &apos; Barbari , whom DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer had met in Venice , visited Nuremberg in 1500 , and DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective , anatomy , and proportion from him .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer may well have worked on some of these , as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s godfather was Anton Koberger , who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s birth .
It includes portraits of members of Venice &apos; s German community , but shows a strong Italian influence .
Between 1507 and 1511 DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings : Adam and Eve -LRB- 1507 -RRB- , The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand -LRB- 1508 , for Frederick the Wise -RRB- , Virgin with the Iris -LRB- 1508 -RRB- , the altarpiece Assumption of the Virgin -LRB- 1509 , for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt -RRB- , and Adoration of the Trinity -LRB- 1511 , for Matthaeus Landauer -RRB- .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself , or glued a paper drawing to the block .
In 1515 , he created his woodcut of the Rhinoceros which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist , without ever seeing the animal himself .
DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer wrote that this treasure `` was much more beautiful to me than miracles .
A series of extant drawings show DÃ 1 \ / 4 rer &apos; s experiments in human proportion , leading to the famous engraving of Adam and Eve -LRB- 1504 -RRB- , which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces .
His famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse are dated 1498 , as is his engraving St. Michael Fighting the Dragon .
His woodcuts , such as the Apocalypse series -LRB- 1498 -RRB- , retain a more Gothic flavor than the rest of his work .
His father was a successful goldsmith , originally named AjtÃ si , who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from AjtÃ s , near Gyula in Hungary .
The Canaanite city-state system broke down at the end of the Late Bronze period , and Canaanite culture was then gradually absorbed into that of the Philistines , Phoenicians and Israelites .
In order to carry out this project the Hasmoneans forcibly converted to Judaism the one-time Moabites , Edomites and Ammonites , as well as the lost kingdom of Israel .
To the southwest is Egypt , to the northeast Mesopotamia .
In the central highlands this resulted in unification in a kingdom with the city of Samaria as its capital , possibly by the second half of the 10th century BCE when an inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh Shoshenq I , the biblical Shishak , records a series of campaigns directed at the area .
Beyond the plateau is the Syrian desert , separating the Levant from Mesopotamia .
To the east again lie the steep-sided valley occupied by the Jordan River , the Dead Sea , and the wadi of the Arabah , which continues down to the eastern arm of the Red Sea .
The coastal plain of the southern Levant , broad in the south and narrowing to the north , is backed in its southernmost portion by a zone of foothills , the Shephalah ; like the plain this narrows as it goes northwards , ending in the promontory of Mount Carmel .
Following their liberation by the Persian conqueror , Cyrus The Great , Judean exiles returned to Jerusalem early in the following Persian period , inaugurating the formative period in the development of a distinctive Judahite identity in the Persian province of Yehud .
By the 9th century BCE the kingdom of Israel had emerged as an important local power before falling to the Assyrians in 722 BC ; its southern neighbor , the kingdom of Judah , enjoyed a period of prosperity as a client-state of the greater empires of the region before a revolt against Babylon led to its destruction by Babylon in 586 BC .
It had clearly emerged by the middle of the 9th century BCE , when the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III names `` Ahab the Israelite &apos; &apos; among his enemies at the battle of Qarqar -LRB- 853 -RRB- , and the Mesha stele -LRB- c . 830 -RRB- left by a king of Moab celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the `` House of Omri &apos; &apos; -LRB- i.e. Israel -RRB- and the Tel Dan stele tells of the death of a king of Israel , probably Jehoram , at the hands of an Aramaen king -LRB- c . 841 -RRB- .
`` The Levant thus constitutes a narrow corridor whose geographical setting made it a constant area of contention between more powerful entities &apos; &apos; .
East of the plain and the Shephalah is a mountainous ridge , the `` hill country of Judah &apos; &apos; in the south , the `` hill country of Ephraim &apos; &apos; north of that , then Galilee and the Lebanon mountains .
The Hasmonean kingdom was a conscious attempt to revive the Judah described in the Bible : a Jewish monarchy ruled from Jerusalem and stretching over all the territories once ruled by David and Solomon .
The eastern Mediterranean seaboard â `` the Levant â `` stretches 400 miles north to south from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai desert , and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the Arabian desert .
Settlement was concentrated in cities along the coastal plain and along major communication routes ; the central and northern hill country which would later become the biblical kingdom of Israel was only sparsely inhabited although letters from the Egyptian archives indicate that Jerusalem was already a Canaanite city-state recognizing Egyptian overlordship . Politically and culturally it was dominated by Egypt , each city under its own ruler , constantly at odds with its neighbors , and appealing to the Egyptians to adjudicate their differences .
Yehud was absorbed into the subsequent Hellenistic kingdoms that followed the conquests of Alexander the Great , but in the 2nd century BC the Judaeans revolted against the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire and created an independent Hasmonean kingdom .
Originally named as the `` Royal and Pontifical University of the City of the Kings of Lima &apos; &apos; , San Marcos was chartered on May 12 , 1551 by a royal decree signed by King Charles I of Spain , which makes it the oldest officially established university in the Americas and , as such , one of the oldest universities in the world .

The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when it was completed in 1937 , and has become one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco , California , and of the United States . Despite its span length being surpassed by eight other bridges since its completion , it still has the second longest suspension bridge main span in the United States , after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City .
Before the bridge was built , the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay .
As part of both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 , it connects the city of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County .
The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate , the opening of the San Francisco Bay into the Pacific Ocean .

The goddess Wadjet was its local goddess , often represented as a cobra , and she was considered the patron deity of Lower Egypt .
Archaeological evidence shows that Upper Egyptian culture replaced the Buto-culture at the delta when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified , and the replacement is considered important evidence for the unification of the two portions of Egypt into one entity .
The Greek historians record that the town was celebrated for its monolithite temple and oracle of the goddess Wadjet -LRB- Buto -RRB- -LRB- Herod .
Buto originally was two cities , Pe and Dep , which merged into one city that the Egyptians named Per-Wadjet .
The city was an important site in the Predynastic era of Ancient Egypt that includes the cultural developments of ten thousand years from the Paleolithic to 3100 BC .

The pie chart is perhaps the most ubiquitous statistical chart in the business world and the mass media . However , it has been criticized , and some recommend avoiding it , pointing out in particular that it is difficult to compare different sections of a given pie chart , or to compare data across different pie charts .
This can be illustrated with the diagram to the right , showing three pie charts , and , below each of them , the corresponding bar chart representing the same data . Most subjects have difficulty ordering the slices in the pie chart by size ; when the bar chart is used the comparison is much easier .

Several methods for solving such systems are known .
In cryptography , the XSL attack is a method of cryptanalysis for block ciphers .
Therefore , it does not affect the real-world security of block ciphers in the near future .
Nonetheless , the attack has caused some experts to express greater unease at the algebraic simplicity of the current AES .
It has caused some controversy as it was claimed to have the potential to break the Advanced Encryption Standard -LRB- AES -RRB- cipherâ &apos; &apos; also known as Rijndaelâ &apos; &apos; faster than an exhaustive search .
In the XSL attack , a specialized algorithm , termed XSL -LRB- eXtended Sparse Linearization -RRB- , is then applied to solve these equations and recover the key .
In overview , the XSL attack relies on first analyzing the internals of a cipher and deriving a system of quadratic simultaneous equations .
The method has a high work-factor , which unless lessened , means the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to an exhaustive search .
These systems of equations are typically very large , for example 8000 equations with 1600 variables for the 128-bit AES .
The attack was first published in 2002 by researchers Nicolas Courtois and Josef Pieprzyk .
The attack is notable for requiring only a handful of known plaintexts to perform ; previous methods of cryptanalysis , such as linear and differential cryptanalysis , often require unrealistically large numbers of known or chosen plaintexts .

If a player &apos; s move places the opponent &apos; s king under attack , that king is said to be in check , and the player in check is required to immediately remedy the situation .
Castling is allowed only when neither the king nor the castling rook has previously moved , when no squares between them are occupied , when the king is not in check , and when the king will not move across or end its movement on a square that is under enemy control .
In the endgame , however , the king emerges to play an active role as an offensive piece as well as assisting in the promotion of their remaining pawns .
The object of the game is to trap the opponent &apos; s king so that its capture is unavoidable -LRB- checkmate -RRB- .
In the opening and middlegame , the king will rarely play an active role in the development of an offensive or defensive position .
Castling consists of moving the king two squares on its first rank toward either one of the original rooks , then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed .
There are three possible methods to remove the king from check :
If it can not escape capture on the next move , the king is said to be in checkmate , and the player who owns that king loses the game .
The king is also involved in the special move of castling .
In conjunction with a rook , the king may make a special move called castling , in which the king moves two squares toward one of its rooks and then the rook is placed on the other side of the king .
If none of these three options are possible , the player &apos; s king has been checkmated and the player loses the game .
Instead , a player will normally try to castle and seek safety on the edge of the board behind friendly pawns .

Breeding preference goes to `` button &apos; &apos; style pugs .
Their smooth , glossy coats can be fawn , apricot , silver or black .
Hip dysplasia is a major problem for the breed , with 63.8 % of pugs being affected according to a survey performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals , and they were ranked second worst affected by the condition out of 157 breeds tested .
The Pug Dog Club of America was founded in 1931 and recognized by the AKC that same year .
The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper , meeting in an under-bite .
Other films featuring the breed includes Hotel for Dogs , The Adventures of Milo and Otis , Disney &apos; s Pocahontas , 12 Rounds , Marie Antoinette .
`` Reverse sneezing &apos; &apos; episodes are usually not harmful to the pug and resolve themselves .
On television , they have appeared in shows such as The King of Queens , Spin City , Legend of the Dragon , The West Wing and Eastenders .
They have been described as multum in parvo -LRB- `` much in little &apos; &apos; -RRB- , referring to the pug &apos; s personality and small size .
References to pug-like dogs have been documented as early as 551 BCE by Confucius , who described a type of `` short mouthed dog &apos; &apos; .
A pug traveled with William III and Mary II when they left the Netherlands to ascend to the throne of England in 1688 .
In 1789 , a Mrs. Piozzi wrote in her journal , `` The little pug dog or Dutch mastiff has quitted London for Padua , I perceive . Every carriage I meet here has a pug in it . &apos; &apos;
The pug is a `` toy &apos; &apos; -LRB- very small -RRB- breed of dog with a wrinkly , short-muzzled face , and curled tail .
The tail normally curls tightly over the hip .
A pug &apos; s normal body temperature is between 101 Â and 102 Â .
Pugs can suffer from necrotizing meningoencephalitis -LRB- NME -RRB- , also known as pug dog encephalitis -LRB- PDE -RRB- , an inflammation of the brain and meninges , that also occurs in other small-breed dogs , such as the Maltese and Chihuahua .
`` Rose &apos; &apos; ears are smaller than the standard style `` button &apos; &apos; and are folded with the front edge against the side of the head .
All dogs usually die or are euthanised within a few months after the onset of clinical signs , which usually occurs anywhere from 6 months to 7 years of age .
Pugs have been featured in television and film , including Frank the Pug in the film Men in Black , its sequel and the follow-up animated series .
The pug &apos; s popularity spread to Tibet , where they were mainly kept by Buddhist monks , and then went on to Japan , and finally Europe . The exact origins of the pug are unknown , as Emperor Qin Shi Huang , the first Emperor of China , destroyed all records , scrolls and art related to the pug at some point during his reign which lasted between 221 and 210 BCE .
A silver pug typically has a very dark head , with no clear delineation at the mask , and dark forelegs .
Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears , `` rose &apos; &apos; and `` button &apos; &apos; .
The feet are neither so long as the foot of the hare , nor so round as that of the cat ; well split-up toes , and the nails black .
The pug was also well known in Italy .
Should the temperature reach 108 Â , the internal organs begin to break down at a cellular level which can lead to severe long term health issues or even death .
Her many pugs , which she bred herself , included Olga , Pedro , Minka , Fatima and Venus .
The legs are very strong , straight , of moderate length , and are set well under . The shoulders are moderately laid back .

The syntax is , for example -LRB- 90377 -RRB- Sedna or .
The parentheses are now often dropped , as in 90377 Sedna , according to the preference of the astronomer or journal .
The convention for satellites of minor planets , such as the formal designation -LRB- 87 -RRB- Sylvia I Romulus for the asteroid moon Romulus , is an extension of the Roman numeral convention that had been used , on and off , for the moons of the planets since Galileo &apos; s time .
They are used for dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as asteroids , but not comets .
By 1851 there were 15 known asteroids , all but one with their own symbol .
They are assigned to a body once its orbit is secured , and are unrelated to provisional designations , which are automatically assigned when an object is discovered .
Comets are also managed by the Minor Planet Center , but use a different cataloguing system .
Since Pluto was initially classified as a planet , it was not given a number until a 2006 redefinition of `` planet &apos; &apos; that excluded it .
Formal minor planet designations are number-name combinations overseen by the Minor Planet Center , a branch of the IAU .
At that point , Pluto was given the formal designation -LRB- 134340 -RRB- Pluto .
In practice , however , for any reasonably well-known object the number is mostly a catalogue entry , and the name or provisional designation is generally used in place of the formal designation : Sedna , .
Other punctuation such as `` 4 -RRB- Vesta &apos; &apos; and `` 4 , Vesta &apos; &apos; was also used , but had more or less completely died out by 1949 .
This practice was soon coupled with the name itself into an official number-name designation , &apos; &apos; â ` # Vesta &apos; &apos; , as the number of minor planets increased .

Upon maturation , the neck opens to allow sperm cells to swim into the archegonium and fertilize the egg .
Since the archegonium is a haploid structure , egg cells are produced via mitosis . The typical bryophyte archegonium consists of a long neck with a wider base containing the egg cell .
The gametophyte cell closest to the micropyle opening of the embryo sac develops into the egg cell .
Both animals and embryophytes have ova .
An ovum -LRB- plural ova , from the Latin word ovum meaning egg or egg cell -RRB- is a haploid female reproductive cell or gamete .
The resulting zygote develops into an embryo inside the ovule .
In the viviparous animals -LRB- which include humans and all other placental mammals -RRB- , the ovum is fertilized inside the female body , and the embryo then develops inside the uterus , receiving nutrition directly from the mother .
In the flowering plants , the female gametophyte , which usually gives rise to the archegonium , has been reduced to just eight cells referred to as the embryo sac inside the ovule .
In protists , fungi and many plants , such as bryophytes , ferns , and gymnosperms , ova are produced inside archegonia .

Momofuku Ando , ORS , -LRB- March 5 , 1910 â `` January 5 , 2007 -RRB- was a Taiwanese-Japanese businessman who founded Nissin Food Products Co . , Ltd . .
As prices dropped , ramen soon became a booming business .
Called Chikin Ramen , after the original chicken flavor , it was originally considered a luxury item with a price of Â 35 , around six times that of traditional udon and soba noodles at the time .
Ando was born Wu Pai-fu into a wealthy Taiwanese family in Kagi -LRB- today Chiayi -RRB- , Taiwan in 1910 , when Taiwan was a part of the Empire of Japan . Ando &apos; s parents died when he was at an early age .
He was also the chairman of the International Ramen Manufacturers &apos; Association and the Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum is named for him .
In 1964 , seeking a way to promote the instant noodle industry , Ando founded the Instant Food Industry Association , which set guidelines for fair competition and product quality , introducing several industry standards such as the inclusion of production dates on packaging .

However , the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires .
This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally .
Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process .
In some countries , such as Germany , law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction , production , distribution , use and waste of a product , and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way .
This is quite common for instance among homeless people in U.S. cities .
A fee is paid to buy the bottle , separately from the fee to buy what it contains .
It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of -LRB- fictional , national , legal -RRB- `` commodity &apos; &apos; and `` product &apos; &apos; relationships .
Also , since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle , it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving .
When purchasing paint or tires in many places , one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become .
If not , the collected fee can be used to pay for landfill or litter control measures .
If the bottle is returned , the fee is returned , and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling .

The new term sometimes used is DVDP -LRB- `` DVD Premiere &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
DVDPs have collectively grossed over $ 3 billion over the last few years , and have matured enough that DVDP divisions of studios now option their own films .
They are often used to tell stories too short to fill a full TV season , and were particularly common in the early 1990s .
Studios then generate additional revenue through video sales and rentals .
Several companies , such as The Asylum , MTI Home Video , and York Entertainment distribute DVDPs almost exclusively .
DTV releases are subject to fewer content restrictions and less creative dictates than other formats .
This delay often occurs when a studio doubts a film &apos; s commercial prospects would justify a full cinema release , or because its `` release window &apos; &apos; has closed .
A production studio may decide not to generally release a TV show or movie for several possible reasons : poor quality , lack of support from a TV network , controversial nature , or a simple lack of general public interest .

In the case of a TV show , low ratings may cause a network to cancel the show , possibly after having filmed an entire season and aired some episodes .
As the DVD format supplanted the videocassette , companies released movies in DVD format rather than VHS , causing the term `` direct-to-DVD &apos; &apos; to replace `` direct-to-video &apos; &apos; in some instances .
Sometimes OVAs garner enough interest to justify commissioning a full television series , such as Sailor Moon , Tenchi Muyo !
Some Disney Channel shows , such as That &apos; s So Raven , The Suite Life of Zack and Cody , Phil of the Future , and Lilo &amp; Stitch : The Series have also had direct-to-video episodes .
Originally canceled in 2002 , the series was revived in 2005 due partly to its excellent DVD sales .
A release window refers to a timely trend or personality , and missing that window of opportunity means a film , possibly rushed into production , failed to release before the trend faded .
Despite having lower budgets than features intended for theater release , Japanese direct-to-video productions are rarely marred by the poor storyline and lower quality production often associated with the DTV market in the US .
The term is also at times used as a derogatory term for films or sequels of films that are of inferior quality , or are not expected to find financial success .
Once in a while , a studio that makes a movie that was prepared as a direct-to-video film will release it theatrically at the last minute due to the success of another movie with a similar subject matter or an ultimate studio decision .

Certain special episodes of PokÃ mon were released directly on video such as Pikachuâ s Winter Vacation .
In recent years , DVD Premieres have become a substantial source of revenue for movie studios .
Direct-to-video releases have historically carried a stigma of lower technical or artistic quality than theatrical releases .
Occasionally outstanding DVD sales may revive a canceled show , as in the case of Family Guy .
For instance , the DVD release of a TV series might include a bonus episode that was never broadcast as a sales hook .
Studios realized that DVDP movies can be shot on a smaller budget , thus allowing studios larger profits with the combined revenues of home video sales and rentals , in addition to licensing movies for television and for distribution abroad -LRB- where some DVDP movies do see theatrical releases -RRB- .
Studios , limited in the annual number of films to which they grant cinematic releases , may choose to pull the completed film from the theaters , or never exhibit it in theaters at all .

The New Testament was translated into southern Estonian in 1686 -LRB- northern Estonian , 1715 -RRB- . The two dialects were united based on northern Estonian by Anton Thor Helle .
Unlike in standard German but like Finnish and Swedish -LRB- when followed by ` r &apos; -RRB- , Ã is pronounced -LRB- Ã -RRB- , as in English mat . The vowels Ã , Ã -- and Ã are clearly separate phonemes and inherent in Estonian , although the letter shapes come from German .
After the Estonian War of Independence , the Estonian language became the state language of the newly independent country .
Like Finnish , Estonian employs the Latin alphabet , in addition to which the Estonian alphabet contains letters Ã , Ã , Ã 1 \ / 4 , and Ã , plus the later additions Å and Å 3 \ / 4 .
The dispute was between those , such as the followers of the `` Pillars of the Church , &apos; &apos; led by James , who believed , following his interpretation of the Great Commission , that the church must observe the Torah , i.e. the rules of traditional Judaism , and Paul of Tarsus , who believed there was no such necessity .
Fos-sur-Mer is a commune in the Bouches-du-Rh Ã ne department in southern France .
Zaragoza was also very powerful and expansive , but inhibited by the neighbor Christian states of the Pyrenees .
The origins of the taifas must be sought in the administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate of CÃ rdoba , as well in the ethnic division of the elite of this state , divided among Arabs , Berbers , Iberian Muslims -LRB- known as MuladÃ es - the overwhelming majority -RRB- and the Eastern European former slaves .
The most dynamic taifa , which conquered most of its neighbors before the Almoravid invasion , was Seville .
Reversing the trend of the Umayyad period , when the Christian kingdoms of the north often had to pay tribute to the Caliph , the disintegration of the Caliphate left the rival Muslim kingdoms much weaker than their Christian counterparts , particularly the Castilian-Leonese monarchy , and had to submit to them , paying tributes known as parias .
Taifas often hired Christian mercenaries to fight neighbouring realms -LRB- both Christian and Muslim -RRB- .
In the history of the Iberian Peninsula , a taifa -LRB- from á Ä ` ifa , plural Ø Ù Ø Ø Ù á awÄ ` if -RRB- was an independent Muslim-ruled principality , usually an emirate or petty kingdom , though there was one oligarchy , of which a number formed in the Al-Andalus -LRB- Moorish Iberia -RRB- after the final collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate of CÃ rdoba in 1031 .
Due to their military weakness , taifa princes appealed for North African warriors to come fight Christian kings on two occasions .
There was a second period when taifas arose , toward the middle of the 12th century , when the Almoravid rulers were in decline .
Zaragoza , Toledo , and Badajoz had previously been the border military districts of the Caliphate .
During the heyday of the taifas , in the 11th century and again in the mid 12th century , their emirs -LRB- rulers -RRB- competed among themselves , not only militarily but also for cultural prestige .
They tried to recruit the most famous poets and artisans .
The Almoravids were invited after the fall of Toledo -LRB- 1085 -RRB- , and the Almohads after the fall of Lisbon -LRB- 1147 -RRB- .
These warriors did not in fact help the taifa emirs but rather annexed their lands to their own North African empires .

The Kam Dwarf Hamster -LRB- Cricetulus kamensis -RRB- is a species of rodent in the Cricetidae family .
It is found only in China .
A good example is found here at : Template : SEPTA color :
The style template allows the modification , at a system level , of display parameters for inter-related templates , including : Template : Infobox Station .
The parameter makes it possible to show within the box lines available at a different station with which there &apos; s a direct transfer from the current station .
This also forces the use of hex codes ; no nouns are permitted -LRB- e.g. red , white -RRB- .
You can see that S-line takes only parameters -- no linking necessary !
The Limited &apos; s `` left &apos; &apos; template is still a simple line of text -- Chicago -- but the `` right &apos; &apos; template needs a switch statement .
Note : this template is called by ; an alias .
This template is designed the same way as the others except that a default case is rare -- lines within a system tend to have a different color .
S-line must be encased within and .
Before discussing them , however , let &apos; s review the parameters :
: Template : S-rail is used to generate headings for each grouping of rail services in a box .
In this example below , the branch template -LRB- : Template : MBTA lines \ / branches -RRB- is defined , allowing branch linking .
Optionally , Template : lines \ / branches may be defined , which allows the linking of the branch parameter .
They can also get pretty tricky depending on the setup .
The template receives one parameter , from S-line .
For rail lines that operate in only one direction -LRB- such as going around a loop -RRB- , the oneway1 or oneway2 parameters are used , to indicate that the Previous or Next station , respectively , does not have service going towards it .
Template : S-rail-start is a variant of the generic template used to begin thousands of succession boxes .
Additionally , left and right termini are returned based on the passed parameter :
The template receives two parameters from S-line , and , although use of the latter is not often necessary .
Now , let &apos; s say we &apos; ve got a more complicated example , like the Lake Shore Limited , which runs from Chicago east to either Boston or New York .
You need templates to define the following things : the formatting \ / linking of the line , the formatting \ / linking of the previous and next stations , the display of the line &apos; s color , and the display of the appropriate termini -- all automatic .
Therefore , `` Dowagiac &apos; &apos; produces Dowagiac , all linked and ready to go .
For an example , here are the templates necessary to properly display this box -LRB- a version of which is at Kalamazoo Transportation Center :
The use of is highly recommended but not required .
When these parameters are present with any non-null value , the toward -LRB- Terminal -RRB- line is replaced with One-way Operation .
The rows parameters specify how many lines the station should cover , while the hide parameters ensure that the table formatting remains intact .
The template takes one parameter , .
The Wolverine is an easy example .
Additionally , the branch name is displayed beneath the line name .
This template carries a translation table for the formatting \ / linking of the line .
For S-line to produce the table above five separate templates were defined .
The two parameters must be used together , with hide specified for every line that is being covered by the first line .
Therefore , the `` left &apos; &apos; -LRB- westbound -RRB- template contains `` Chicago &apos; &apos; while the `` right &apos; &apos; -LRB- eastbound -RRB- template contains `` Pontiac &apos; &apos; .
Note that color is spelled the American way in the template ; the creator apologizes in advance and it &apos; s probably not worth the hassle to change it at this stage .
S-line depends on sub-templates for the proper display of information .
A feature of S-line is that if it detects that the next station is the name as the terminus , it will display a note to that effect instead of the destination .
The easiest way to start the station template is with the default case that reflects how articles on system stations are named .
Station will be either the PREVIOUS or NEXT parameter ; both are handled the same way behind the scenes .
Template : S-line \ / left \ / -LRB- : Template : S-line \ / Amtrak left \ / Wolverine -RRB- Template : S-line \ / right \ / -LRB- : Template : S-line \ / Amtrak right \ / Wolverine -RRB- These are the all-important templates which produce the `` towards ... &apos; &apos; part of the templates .
The relevant line from : Template : Amtrak lines is this :
Here &apos; s the Limited &apos; s `` right &apos; &apos; template :
Here we have only one , but some particularly large terminals may have three or four -LRB- see Union Station -LRB- Chicago -RRB- or 30th Street Station -RRB- .
In order to make this work properly , you have to define the concept of `` New York or Boston South &apos; &apos; in the STATION template , like so :
This allows three eastbound destinations : New York , Boston , or both if the train has n &apos;t reached the junction point yet .
The left and right templates receive one parameter , , from s-line , which tells them which termini to return .
These names are plugged in to the STATION template just as NEXT and PREVIOUS were , with the results that you can see above .
S-rail uses the translation table at : Template : S-rail \ / lines ; if the entry is undefined , it simply links the text .
It runs end-to-end from Chicago , Illinois to Pontiac , Michigan .
Therefore , Amtrak produces Amtrak , while LUL gives London Underground .
This means if the article ever moves , you need only to update switch statement , not individual articles .
In the example below , the parameter designates four different parts of the MBTA Green Line .
For example , for a CTA station in the Chicago Loop :
This snippet is taken from the article about the Finchley Road tube station .
The pound sign is included within s-line so it is n &apos;t necessary .
The parameter can be used to describe a subset of a .
For lines that operate on the same tracks and serve the same next station and final terminal , the rows1 , rows2 , hide1 , and hide2 optional parameters can be used to have the Previous -LRB- the 1s -RRB- or Next -LRB- the 2s -RRB- Station boxes cover more than one line .
A default statement is acceptable here if it is true for disproportionate length of the line .
With systems that have unusual or non-uniform naming , like Amtrak , it may be necessary to have a test case for every line .
An example of this use can be seen in the above CTA box .
Amtrak is an important exception , and does n &apos;t even have a switch statement : the template consists only of the hex code : 004670 .
When passed to the left and right termini templates , the and parameters identify destinations .
This links to the article on the Wolverine and italicizes the article , appropriate for a named train .
S-line accomplishes this through two assumptions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- groups of articles on train stations are named in a predictable manner ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- redirects are cheap .
With Amtrak , it &apos; s done this way :
When a system has uniform naming , you may be able to get away with a default case and only one or two exceptions , as in : Template : LUL lines :
If a change is made which alters \ / adds parameters names that template must be updated to reflect the new situation .
Note that , in the above CTA example , the previous and oneway1 parameters could have been omitted from the Purple and Pink line entries , but were left in for consistency &apos; s sake .

Henry Gee , senior editor at Nature magazine , speculates that species like H. floresiensis might still exist in the unexplored tropical forest of Indonesia .
Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago .
Believed to be present at the time of the arrival of the first Portuguese ships during the 16th century , these creatures are claimed to have existed as recently as the late 19th century .
They were not expecting to find a new species , and were surprised at the recovery of a nearly complete skeleton of a hominin they dubbed LB1 because it was unearthed inside the Liang Bua Cave .
Gerd van den Bergh , a paleontologist working with the fossils , reported hearing of the Ebu Gogo a decade before the fossil discovery .
Local geology suggests that a volcanic eruption on Flores approximately 12,000 years ago was responsible for the demise of H. floresiensis , along with other local fauna , including the elephant Stegodon .
On the island of Sumatra , there are reports of a 1-1 .5 m tall humanoid , the Orang Pendek which might be related to H. floresiensis .
The implements are at horizons from 95,000 to 13,000 years ago and are associated with -LRB- found in the same stratigraphic layer as -RRB- an elephant of the extinct genus Stegodon -LRB- which was widespread throughout Asia during the Quaternary -RRB- , presumably the prey of LB1 .
The specimens are not fossilized and have been described as having `` the consistency of wet blotting paper &apos; &apos; ; once exposed , the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug up .
The specimens were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores by a joint Australian-Indonesian team of archaeologists in 2003 looking for evidence of the original human migration of H. sapiens from Asia to Australia .
Tocheri et al . -LRB- 2007 -RRB- -LRB- including Morwood , Larson , and Jungers -RRB- , compared three carpal bones believed to belong to LB1 with carpal bones of modern humans , some earlier hominids and African apes . They concluded that the carpals from the Liang Bua cave resembled ape carpal bones and were significantly different from the bones of H. sapiens , Homo neanderthalensis or even Homo antecessor , and that they were comparable to carpal bones of Australopithecus .
Researchers hope to find preserved mitochondrial DNA to compare with samples from similarly unfossilised specimens of Homo neanderthalensis and H. sapiens .
A study of the bones and joints of the arm , shoulder , and lower limbs also concluded that H. floresiensis was more similar to early humans and apes than modern humans .
The discoverers -LRB- archaeologist Mike Morwood and colleagues -RRB- proposed that a variety of features , both primitive and derived , identify these individuals as belonging to a new species , H. floresiensis , within the taxonomic tribe of Hominini .
Hominini currently comprises the extant species human -LRB- the only living member of the genus Homo -RRB- , bonobo -LRB- genus Pan -RRB- , and chimpanzee -LRB- genus Pan -RRB- ; their ancestors ; and the extinct lineages of their common ancestor .
The species is thought to have survived on Flores at least until 12,000 years before present , making it the longest lasting non-modern human , surviving long past the Neanderthals -LRB- H. neanderthalensis -RRB- , which became extinct about 24,000 years ago .
The discoverers also proposed that H. floresiensis lived contemporaneously with modern humans -LRB- Homo sapiens -RRB- on Flores .
Gregory Forth hypothesized that H. floresiensis may have survived longer in other parts of Flores to become the source of the Ebu Gogo stories told among the local people .
An arm bone provisionally assigned to H. floresiensis is about 74,000 years old .
A study of three tokens of carpal -LRB- wrist -RRB- bones concluded there were similarities to the carpal bones of a chimpanzee or an early hominin such as Australopithecus and also differences from the bones of modern humans .
The Ebu Gogo are said to have been small , hairy , language-poor cave dwellers on the scale of this species .
This has led the discoverers of H. floresiensis to conclude that the species , or its ancestors , could only have reached the isolated island by water transport , perhaps arriving in bamboo rafts around 100,000 years ago -LRB- or , if they are H. erectus , then about 1 million years ago -RRB- .
In 2009 , the publication of a cladistic analysis and a study of comparative body measurements provided further support for the hypothesis that H. floresiensis and Homo sapiens are separate species .
They also shared the island with giant rats , Komodo dragons , and even larger species of lizards .
Because of a deep neighboring strait , Flores remained isolated during the Wisconsin glaciation -LRB- the most recent glacial period -RRB- , despite the low sea levels that united Sundaland .
Two orthopedic researches published in 2007 both reported evidence to support species status for H. floresiensis .
Subsequent excavations recovered seven additional skeletons , dating from 38,000 to 13,000 years ago .

In the latter sense , the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that one &apos; s words , taken literally , are innocent .
Shows such as The Simpsons , Futurama , Son of the Beach , The Office , King of The Hill , House -LRB- TV series -RRB- , Beavis and Butthead , Everybody Hates Chris , American Dad , Tosh .0 , and especially Family Guy and South Park have done this .
It can also be a remark or question , typically disparaging -LRB- also called insinuation -RRB- , that works obliquely by allusion .
Also many prime time shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point it is rated TV PG \ / 14 D for dialogue .
Also , many radio shows , including The Gallo Radio Show , most of the songs played on Southern Crossroads , sometimes The Rick &amp; Bubba Show , The Steve and DC Morning Show , especially The JT &amp; Dave Show , Air Bubba and The Bob &amp; Tom Show are notable for this .
Shows such as The FairlyOdd Parents , Spongebob Squarepants , The Penguins of Madagascar , Rocko &apos; s Modern Life , Cow &amp; Chicken , Ren &amp; Stimpy and especially Animaniacs and Looney Tunes have been known to do this over the years .
The term sexual innuendo has acquired a specific meaning , namely that of a `` risque &apos; &apos; double entendre by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering .
According to the Advanced Oxford Learner &apos; s Dictionary , an innuendo is `` an indirect remark about somebody &apos; s body , usually suggesting something bad , mean or rude ; the use of remarks like this : innuendoes about her private life or The song is full of sexual innuendo . &apos; &apos;
Many television shows aimed at a younger audience frequently use innuendos as a way of attracting older viewers without offending their network &apos; s censorship .
The word is often used to express disapproval .

In Japanese , chopsticks are called hashi , written .
In Vietnamese , chopsticks are called &apos; &apos; Ä ` Å a &apos; &apos; , which is written as ð with ç `` trÃ c -LRB- bamboo -RRB- as the semantic , and æ Ä ` á &apos; &apos; -- as the phonetic part in Chá &apos; &apos; NÃ m .
Chopsticks are most commonly made of bamboo or plastic , but are also made of metal , bone , ivory , and various types of wood .
The Standard Chinese word for chopsticks is ç å .
In ancient written Chinese , the character for chopsticks was ç -LRB- Middle Chinese : dÌ jwo - ; -RRB- .
Chopsticks are small , often tapered , sticks used in pairs of equal length as the traditional eating utensils of China and its diaspora , Japan , Korea , Vietnam and Northern provinces of Laos , Thailand and Burma .
They are also known as otemoto or o-temoto , a phrase commonly printed on the wrappers of disposable chopsticks .
A 2003 study found that regular use of chopsticks by the elderly may slightly increase the risk of osteoarthritis in the hand , a condition in which cartilage is worn out , leading to pain and swelling in the hand joints .
While China , Japan , Korea and Vietnam had long included chopsticks as part of their traditional eating utensils , the use of chopsticks in a limited sense spread to other Asian countries in recent centuries with the influx of Chinese immigrants in Southeast Asia .
However , it is postulated by some that the pronunciation for this character became a taboo on ships because it sounded either the same or similar to the word meaning `` to stop &apos; &apos; -LRB- ä 1 \ / 2 -RRB- in many Chinese languages .
For written semantic differentiation between the `` fast &apos; &apos; versus `` chopsticks &apos; &apos; meanings of å `` , a new character ç was created for chopsticks by adding the bamboo -LRB- ç `` -RRB- radical -LRB- â -RRB- to it .
The English word `` chopstick &apos; &apos; seems to have been derived from Chinese Pidgin English , a pidgin in which `` chop chop &apos; &apos; meant quickly .
Jeo can not be used alone .
The first character -LRB- ç -RRB- is a semantic-phonetic compound with a phonetic part meaning `` quick &apos; &apos; -LRB- å `` -RRB- , and a semantic part meaning `` bamboo &apos; &apos; -LRB- ç `` -RRB- .
This adds up to 1.7 million cubic metres of timber or 25 million fully grown trees every year .

In China , an estimated 45 billion pairs of disposable chopsticks are used and thrown away annually .

Silla -LRB- 57 BC â `` 935 AD -RRB- was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea , and one of the longest sustained dynasties in Asian history . Although it was founded by King Park Hyeokgeose , who is also known to be the originator of the Korean family name Park -LRB- ë , æ -RRB- , the dynasty was to see the Gyeongju Kim -LRB- ê , é ` -RRB- clan hold rule for most of its 992-year history .
What began as a chiefdom in the Samhan confederacies , once allied with China , Silla eventually conquered the other two kingdoms , Baekje in 660 and Goguryeo in 668 .
Buddhism in Silla was , more so than in the case of Baekje and Goguryeo , an officially sponsored faith .
The capital of the Silla kingdom was Gyeongju .
Compared with the rounded Romanesque style , the pointed arch of the Early English Gothic looks more elegant and , more importantly , is more efficient at distributing the weight of the stonework above it , making it possible to span higher and wider gaps using narrower columns .
For this reason Early English Gothic is sometimes known as the `` Lancet &apos; &apos; style . Although arches of equilateral proportion are most often employed , lancet arches of very acute proportions are frequently found and are a highly characteristic of the style .
The Lancet openings of windows and decorative arcading are often grouped in twos or threes .
Pointed arches were used almost universally , not only in arches of wide span such as those of the nave arcade , but also for doorways and lancet windows .
The mullions then branch out and cross , intersecting to fill the top part of the window with a mesh of elaborate patterns called tracery , typically including trefoils and quatrefoils .
As with the Gothic architecture of other parts of Europe , English Gothic is defined by its pointed arches , vaulted roofs , buttresses , large windows , and spires .
In areas of Southern England using flint architecture , elaborate flushwork decoration in flint and ashlar was used , especially in the wool churches of East Anglia .
The high walls and vaulted stone roofs were often supported by flying buttresses : half arches which transmit the outward thrust of the superstructure to supports or buttresses , often visible on the exterior of the building .
The most significant and characteristic development of the Early English period was the pointed arch known as the lancet .
Elaborate windows are subdivided by closely spaced parallel mullions -LRB- vertical bars of stone -RRB- , usually up to the level at which the arched top of the window begins .
The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals , abbey churches and collegiate buildings .
At York Minster there is , in the north transept , a cluster of five lancet windows known as the Five Sisters , each fifty feet high and still retaining ancient glass .
English Gothic is the name of the architectural style that flourished in England from about 1180 until about 1520 .
The arched windows are usually narrow by comparison to their height and are without tracery .
This characteristic is seen throughout Salisbury Cathedral where there are groups of two lancet windows lining the nave and groups of three lining the clerestory .
This evolution of decorated tracery is often used to subdivide the period into an earlier `` Geometric &apos; &apos; and later `` Curvilinear &apos; &apos; period .
Some of the earliest examples of the Perpendicular Period , dating from 1360 , are found at Gloucester Cathedral , where the masons of the cathedral would seem to have been far in advance of those in other towns ; the fan-vaulting in the cloisters is particularly fine .
Buttresses and wall surfaces are likewise divided up into vertical panels .
Decorated architecture is characterized by its window tracery .
It is , however , a distinctive characteristic of the cathedrals of England that all but one of them , Salisbury Cathedral , show great stylistic diversity and have building dates that typically range over 400 years .
At its purest the style was simple and austere , emphasising the height of the building , as if aspiring heavenward .
Other good examples are the Galilee porch at Ely Cathedral ; the nave and transept of Wells Cathedral -LRB- 1225 â &apos; &apos; 1240 -RRB- ; the west front of Peterborough Cathedral ; and Beverley Minster and the south transept at York .
Through the employment of the pointed arch , walls could become less massive and window openings could be larger and grouped more closely together , so architects could achieve a more open , airy and graceful building .
Principal examples are those of the east ends of Lincoln Cathedral and of Carlisle Cathedral and the west fronts of York Minster and Lichfield Cathedral .
This perpendicular linearity is particularly obvious in the design of windows , which became very large , sometimes of immense size , with slimmer stone mullions than in earlier periods , allowing greater scope for stained glass craftsmen .
Some of the finest features of this period are the magnificent timber roofs ; hammerbeam roofs , such as those of Westminster Hall -LRB- 1395 -RRB- , Christ Church Hall , Oxford , and Crosby Hall , appeared for the first time .

The platforms and elevators are guarded by creatures confusingly known as Zubs but each planet has a different sub-species - for example the first level &apos; s Zub resembles a gyroscope whilst he fourth level &apos; s is a fish .
The Zubs can be shot and stunned .
There are seven difficulty levels , each one increases the number of enemy Zubs per planet .
Zub is in the employ of Emperor Zub of the Zub galactic empire who has been tasked with retrieving the Green Eye of Zub .
Zub is a game written for the Amstrad CPC , Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum which was published in 1986 by Mastertronic and was written by John and Ste Pickford on the ZX Spectrum and Phillip Brian Allsopp on the Commodore 64 with music on all formats composed by David Whittaker .
In order to facilitate this task , Zub has been permitted use of the ancient intergalactic elevator system which permits transport between planets .
The Green Eye of Zub was last located on the tenth planet and once the Eye is found , Zub has to return to the first planet to present the Eye of Zub to Emperor Zub .
They will float to the top platform level and then descend to harass and attack Zub .
The elevators do not follow any sort of linear route and must be reached by traversing and riding platforms on planets to reach any of the three elevators at the top of the chain .

This means that the 30 % of the energy is lost to the environment .
In the United States , in everyday usage the SEER is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices , as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode .
For thermal efficiency , the input , , to the device is heat , or the heat-content of a fuel that is consumed .
In thermodynamics , the thermal efficiency is a dimensionless performance measure of a device that uses thermal energy , such as an internal combustion engine , a boiler , a furnace , or a refrigerator for example .
Due to inefficiencies such as friction , heat loss , and other factors , thermal engines &apos; efficiencies are typically much less than 100 % .
So , for a boiler that produces 210 kW -LRB- or 700,000 BTU \ / h -RRB- output for each 300 kW -LRB- or 1,000,000 BTU \ / h -RRB- heat-equivalent input , its thermal efficiency is 210 \ / 300 = 0.70 , or 70 % .
When expressed as a percentage , the thermal efficiency must be between 0 % and 100 % .
For example , a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25 % efficiency , and a large coal-fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 46 % .
The thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the percentage of heat energy that is transformed into work .
For energy-conversion heating devices their peak steady-state thermal efficiency is often stated , e.g. , ` this furnace is 90 % efficient &apos; , but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency -LRB- AFUE -RRB- .
In a combined cycle plant , thermal efficiencies are approaching 60 % .
The ` thermal efficiency &apos; is sometimes called the energy efficiency .
Because the input heat normally has a real financial cost , a memorable , generic definition of thermal efficiency is
The desired output is mechanical work , , or heat , , or possibly both .
An electric resistance heater has a thermal efficiency close to 100 % .
When comparing heating units , such as a highly efficient electric resistance heater to an 80 % efficient natural gas-fueled furnace , an economic analysis is needed to determine the most cost-effective choice .
Thermal efficiency is defined as

He said his riding was never the same after the injuries . He frequently adjusted his saddle while riding - including coming down the col de la Faucille on the way to Divonne-les-Bains - and was often in pain , especially while climbing .
Over 15 years , various racers improved the record to more than 56 km .
In the time trial , he overtook the five-time Tour de France winner , Jacques Anquetil , who for 15 years had been the world &apos; s best time-triallist .
The record remained untouched until 1984 , when Francesco Moser broke it using a specially designed bicycle and meticulous improvements in streamlining .
Three of his former riders have worked in his bicycle factory and join him during recreational bike tours .
In 2000 he was chosen Belgian `` Sports Figure of the Century &apos; &apos; .
When time trial specialist Chris Boardman , who had retired from road racing and had prepared himself specifically for beating the record , had another go at Merckx &apos; s distance 28 years later , he beat it by slightly more than 10 meters -LRB- at sea level -RRB- .
Merckx also won 17 six-day track races , often with Patrick Sercu .
Merckx is known as a quiet and modest person .
He lost almost 30 kg and took up recreational cycling again .
Merckx won the Giro d &apos;Italia in 1968 , 1970 , 1972 , 1973 and 1974 .
His final victory came in a battle with the Italians Gianbattista Baronchelli , who he beat by 12 seconds , and Felice Gimondi , who lost by 33 seconds .
Over the next 25 years , only Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain were able to equal him .

The third was to destroy the ability of the opposing navy to wage war at sea .
This was inconclusive , and was followed by a series of small surface actions during the summer , among them battle of the Espero convoy and the battle of Cape Spada .
On the following day , Italian bombers attacked Malta on what was to be the first of many raids .
Following the battle of Crete in the summer of 1941 , the Royal Navy regained its ascendancy in the central Mediterranean in a series of successful convoy attacks , -LRB- Duisburg convoy , Cap Bon -RRB- until the events surrounding the First Battle of Sirte and the Raid on Alexandria in December swung the balance of power in the Axis favor .
Outside of the Pacific , the Mediterranean saw the largest conventional naval warfare during the war .
The first was to attack the supply lines of the other side .
For the most part , the campaign was fought between the Italian Royal Navy -LRB- Regia Marina -RRB- , supported by other Axis naval and air forces , and the British Royal Navy , supported by other Allied naval forces , such as Australia , Netherlands , Poland and Greece .
On 10 June 1940 , Italy declared war on Britain and France .
But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armor and all Italian warships lacked radar , although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that Italian warships were equipped with good rangefinder and fire-control systems for daylight combat .
Each side had three overall goals in this battle .
The warships of the Royal Navy -LRB- Regia Marina -RRB- had a general reputation as well-designed .
In September 1943 , with the Italian collapse and the surrender of Italian fleet , naval actions in Mediterranean became restricted to actions against U-boats and by small craft in the Adriatic and Aegean seas .
In November , the British mounted an aerial attack on the Italian fleet in Taranto harbor , crippling three capital ships and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean .
The first clash between the rival fleetsâ &apos; &apos; the Battle of Calabriaâ &apos; &apos; took place on 9 July , just four weeks after the start of hostilities .
The second was to keep open the supply lines to their own armies in North Africa .
The Battle of the Mediterranean was the name given to the naval campaign fought in the Mediterranean Sea during World War II , from 10 June 1940-2 May 1945 .
A series of hard fought convoy battles -LRB- Second Battle of Sirte in March , Operations Harpoon and Vigorous in June , and Operation Pedestal in August -RRB- ensured Malta &apos; s survival , until the Allies regained the advantage in November 1942 .
In addition , whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act , the actions of Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters -LRB- Supermarina -RRB- .
In particular , Allied forces struggled to supply and retain the key naval and air base of Malta .

The Earth &apos; s motion was described in Newcomb &apos; s Tables of the Sun -LRB- 1895 -RRB- , which provide a formula estimating the motion of the Sun relative to the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made between 1750 and 1892 .
The revised definition seems to imply that the ideal atomic clock contains a single caesium atom at rest emitting a single frequency .
Under the International System of Units -LRB- via the International Committee for Weights and Measures , or CIPM -RRB- , since 1967 the second has been defined as the duration of periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom .
Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV , they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth , from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred , in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock .
Though SI prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second such as kilosecond -LRB- one thousand seconds -RRB- , such units are rarely used in practice .
The tropical year in the definition was not measured , but calculated from a formula describing a mean tropical year that decreased linearly over time , hence the curious reference to a specific instantaneous tropical year .
SI prefixes are frequently combined with the word second to denote subdivisions of the second , e.g. , the millisecond -LRB- one thousandth of a second -RRB- , the microsecond -LRB- one millionth of a second -RRB- , and the nanosecond -LRB- one billionth of a second -RRB- .
The second -LRB- SI symbol : s -RRB- , sometimes abbreviated sec . , is a unit of time , and is the International System of Units -LRB- SI -RRB- base unit of time .
The second thus defined is
Absolute zero implies no movement , and therefore zero external radiation effects -LRB- i.e. , zero local electric and magnetic fields -RRB- .
Following several years of work , Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory -LRB- Teddington , England -RRB- and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory -LRB- USNO -RRB- determined the relationship between the hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second .
The second thus defined is consistent with the ephemeris second , which was based on astronomical measurements .
This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K -LRB- absolute zero -RRB- .

Runners are a type of stolon that exist above ground and are produced by many plants , such as strawberries .
These rise to the soil surface and can produce foliage and flowers .
Plants with stolons or stolon-like rhizomes are called stoloniferous .
In contrast , rhizomes most often have short internodes with leaf-scars and thin paper-like leaves and root along the under side of the stem .
A stolon is a plant propagation strategy and the complex of individuals formed by a mother plant and all its clones produced from stolons form a single genetic individual .
Because of this some botany texts now use the term underground stolon to refer to stolons that move under ground .
Typically , stolons have very long internodes that form new plants at the ends .

Bing is a cultivar of the wild or sweet cherry -LRB- Prunus avium -RRB- that originated in the Pacific Northwest , in Milwaukie , Oregon , United States .
Bing cherries are used almost exclusively for fresh market .
Bing cherries are high in anti-oxidants .
A study by the United States Department of Agriculture has shown that fresh Bing cherries may help sufferers of arthritis and gout .
The Bing remains a major cultivar in Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia .
A wet climate is required for the harvest of the bing cherry .
He went back to China in 1889 for a visit .
Sources disagree as to whether Ah Bing was responsible for developing the cultivar , or whether it was developed by Lewelling and named in Bing &apos; s honor due to his long service as orchard foreman .
It is the most produced variety of sweet cherry in the United States .
Ah Bing was reportedly born in China and immigrated to the U.S. in about 1855 .
Due to the restrictions of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 he never returned to the United States .
He worked as a foreman in the Lewelling family fruit orchards in Milwaukie for about 35 years , supervising other workers and caring for trees .
Bings are large , dark and firm cherries that ship well , but will crack open if exposed to rain near harvest .
However , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that these are yet unproven claims .
The cultivar was created as a crossbred graft from the Republican cherry in 1875 by Oregon horticulturist Seth Lewelling and his Manchurian Chinese foreman Ah Bing , for whom the cultivar is named .

Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by horror author H. P. Lovecraft in 1926 .
This is often shortened to `` Cthulhu fhtagn &apos; &apos; , which might possibly mean `` Cthulhu waits &apos; &apos; , `` Cthulhu dreams &apos; &apos; , or `` Cthulhu waits dreaming . &apos; &apos;
After its first appearance in `` The Call of Cthulhu &apos; &apos; , Cthulhu makes a few minor appearances in other Lovecraft stories .
The cult is noted for chanting the phrase `` Ph ` nglui mglw ` nafh Cthulhu R ` lyeh wgah ` nagl fhtagn &apos; &apos; , which translates as `` In his house at R ` lyeh , dead Cthulhu waits dreaming . &apos; &apos; This is often shortened to `` Cthulhu fhtagn &apos; &apos; , which might possibly mean `` Cthulhu waits &apos; &apos; , `` Cthulhu dreams &apos; &apos; , or `` Cthulhu waits dreaming . &apos; &apos;
While the particulars of their relationship with Cthulhu are unknown , it is clear that they arrived on Earth with him , where they constructed the city of R ` lyeh .

Primarily , nap is the raised -LRB- fuzzy -RRB- surface on certain kinds of cloth , such as velvet .
Starting around the 14th century , the word referred originally to the roughness of woven cloth before it was sheared . When cloth , especially woollen cloth , is woven , the surface of the cloth is not smooth , and this roughness is the nap .
When cloth , especially woollen cloth , is woven , the surface of the cloth is not smooth , and this roughness is the nap . Generally the cloth is then ` sheared &apos; to create an even surface , and the nap is thus removed .
In this case , the nap is woven into the cloth , often by weaving loops into the fabric , which can then be cut or left intact .
Since the 15th century , the term nap generally refers to a special pile given to the cloth .
Carpets , rugs , velvet , velor , and velveteen , are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth , creating a nap or pile .
The term pile refers to raised fibers that are there on purpose , rather than as a by product of producing the cloth .

The ruling elite of the state belonged to the Ismaili branch of Shi ` ism .
After about 1070 , the Fatimid hold on the Levant coast and parts of Syria was challenged first by Turkic invasions , then the Crusades , so that Fatimid territory shrank until it consisted only of Egypt .
AbdullÄ h al-Mahdi &apos; s control soon extended over all of central Maghreb , an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , and Libya , which he ruled from Mahdia , his newly built capital in Tunisia .
After the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s , the Zengid ruler NÅ `` r ad-D Ä `` n had his general Shirkuh , seize Egypt from the vizier Shawar in 1169 .
The caliphate was reputed to exercise a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Shia sects of Islam as well as towards Jews , Maltese Christians , and Coptic Christians .
The leaders of the dynasty were also Shia Ismaili Imams , hence , they had a religious significance to Ismaili Muslims .

It is popularly believed that Pavlov always signaled the occurrence of food by ringing a bell .
Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlovâ s contemporaries Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev and John B. Watson , until Thomas found several references that unambiguously stated Pavlov did , indeed , use a bell .
He noticed that the dogs tended to salivate before food was actually delivered to their mouths , and set out to investigate this `` psychic secretion &apos; &apos; , as he called it .
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was an enthusiastic advocate of the importance of Pavlov &apos; s work for philosophy of mind .
It is less widely known that Pavlov &apos; s experiments on the conditional reflex extended to children , some of whom apparently underwent surgical procedures , similar to those performed on the dogs , for the collection of saliva .
The phrase `` Pavlov &apos; s dog &apos; &apos; is often used to describe someone who merely reacts to a situation rather than using critical thinking .
Pavlov &apos; s research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science , but also popular culture .
In the 1890s , Pavlov was investigating the gastric function of dogs by externalizing a salivary gland so he could collect , measure , and analyze the saliva and what response it had to food under different conditions .
Catania cast doubt on whether Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his famous experiments .
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov -LRB- September 14 , 1849 - February 27 , 1936 -RRB- was a famous Russian physiologist .
However , his writings record the use of a wide variety of stimuli , including electric shocks , whistles , metronomes , tuning forks , and a range of visual stimuli , in addition to ringing a bell .
As Pavlov &apos; s work became known in the West , particularly through the writings of John B. Watson , the idea of `` conditioning &apos; &apos; as an automatic form of learning became a key concept in the developing specialism of comparative psychology , and the general approach to psychology that underlay it , behaviorism .
Pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in Aldous Huxley &apos; s dystopian novel , Brave New World , and also to a large degree in Thomas Pynchon &apos; s Gravity &apos; s Rainbow .
Voters were required to select one player from each team and player-coaches and prior award winners were ineligible .

MVP voting takes place before the postseason but the results are not announced until after the World Series .
Winners , voted on by a committee of eight baseball writers chaired by James Crusinberry , received a bronze medal and a cash prize .
The award &apos; s only tie occurred in the National League in 1979 when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received an equal amount of points .
The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers &apos; widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians .
The only significant change since then occurred in 1961 , when the number of voters was lowered to two per league city .
The National League award , without these restrictions , lasted from 1924 to 1929 .

The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22 , followed by the St. Louis Cardinals with 20 winners .
A committee of baseball writers were to convene after the season to determine the `` most important and useful player to the club and to the league &apos; &apos; .
The BBWAA first awarded the modern MVP after the 1931 season , adopting the format the National League used to distribute its league award .
On the last day of the season , Lajoie overtook Cobb &apos; s batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns .
Since 1931 , it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America -LRB- BBWAA -RRB- .
Before the 1910 season , Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile announced he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball at the end of the season .
Of the twenty-three pitchers who have won the award , fourteen are right-handed while nine are left-handed .
Since the award was not as effective at advertising as Chalmers had hoped , it was discontinued after 1914 .
The following season , Chalmers created the Chalmers Award .
American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway , and Chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players .
Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win multiple times ; ten players have won three times and seventeen have won twice .
The BBWAA began polling three writers in each league city in 1938 , reducing that number to two per league city in 1961 .
One writer in each city with a team filled out a ten-place ballot , with ten points for the recipient of a first-place vote , nine for a second-place vote , and so on .

Cyclone Catarina was an extraordinarily rare tropical cyclone , forming in the southern Atlantic Ocean in March 2004 .
South Atlantic tropical cyclones are unusual weather events that occur in the southern hemisphere .
On April 10 , 1991 , a weak tropical storm formed in the eastern South Atlantic , recorded by weather satellites off the coast of Angola .
It organized and appeared to become a tropical depression on January 18 .
A small area of convection developed on a trough of low pressure in mid January off Brazil .
It formed on April 10 , and dissipated two days later , drifting west-southwestward from where it formed .
While under study , the system was referred to as 90L Invest .
Just after becoming a hurricane , it hit the southern coast of Brazil in the state of Santa Catarina on the evening of March 28 , with winds estimated near 155 k , making it a Category 2-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale .
The shear would eventually cause the system to dissipate later that night .
The depression moved inland on the 20th as a circulation devoid of convection , and dissipated the next day over Brazil , where it caused heavy rains and flooding .
A small area of convection 600 miles southeast of Rio de Janeiro was tracked into an area of relatively low shear and marginal 26 Â C waters on February 23 , 2006 .
If a `` hurricane season &apos; &apos; were to be demarcated in the South Atlantic , it would most likely be the opposite of the North Atlantic season , from November to the end of April with mid-March being the peak when the oceans are warmest in the Southern Hemisphere .
Of the few South Atlantic tropical cyclones that have existed , this was the only one in the eastern portion of the South Atlantic .
Located 150 n southeast of Salvador , Brazil , it weakened as upper level shear , typical for the basin , prevailed .
These characteristics were operationally recognized for three hours before high shear began to tear the system apart , just short of the six hours required to be officially declared a tropical depression .
The next morning , it had a small CDO and well-defined bands , and the system , either a weak tropical storm or a strong tropical depression , likely reached its peak .
The cyclone killed 3 to 10 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in Brazil .

Ostrom noted the small body , sleek , horizontal , posture , ratite-like spine , andâ &apos; &apos; especiallyâ &apos; &apos; the enlarged raptorial claws on the feet , which suggested an active , agile predator .
These features seemed to make the tail into a stiff counterbalance , but a fossil of the very closely related Velociraptor mongoliensis -LRB- IGM 100 \ / 986 -RRB- has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved laterally in a long Sâ `` shape .
Teeth discovered associated with Tenontosaurus specimens imply it was hunted or at least scavenged upon by Deinonychus .
This 3.4 meter -LRB- 11 ft -RRB- long dinosaur lived during the early Cretaceous Period , about 115-108 million years ago -LRB- from the mid-Aptian to early Albian stages -RRB- .
The species name antirrhopus means â counter balanceâ , which refers to John Ostrom &apos; s idea about the function of the tail .
Before this , the popular conception of dinosaurs had been one of plodding , reptilian giants .
Fossils have been recovered from the U.S. states of Montana , Wyoming , and Oklahoma , in rocks of the Cloverly Formation and Antlers Formation , though teeth that may belong to Deinonychus have been found much farther east in Maryland .
This suggests that , in life , the tail could swish to the sides with a high degree of flexibility .
In both the Cloverly and Antlers Formation , Deinonychus remains have been found closely associated with those of the ornithopod Tenontosaurus .
As in other dromaeosaurids , the tail vertebrae have a series of ossified tendons and super-elongated bone processes .

Its orbit is slightly more eccentric that that of Hygiea -LRB- 15 % versus 12 % -RRB- but differs from Hygiea &apos; s in its much greater inclination and slightly shorter period .
Its mean distance from the Sun is 3.067 -LRB- AU -RRB- .
It is unlikely to collide with Pallas because their nodes are located too far apart , whilst although its nodes are located on the opposite side from those of Ceres , it is generally clear of Ceres when both cross the same orbital plane and a collision is again unlikely .
It was discovered on October 2 , 1910 by Vincenzo Cerulli , and named after the Latin name for Teramo , Italy , where Cerulli worked .
Its apparently high bulk density -LRB- though subject to much error -RRB- suggests an extremely solid body entirely without internal porosity or traces of water .
It is easily the largest of the F-type asteroids , but there exist very few details of its internal composition or shape , and no lightcurve analysis has yet been done to determining the ecliptic coordinates of Interamnia &apos; s poles -LRB- and hence its axial tilt -RRB- .
At most oppositions its magnitude is around + 11.0 , which is less than the minimum brightness of Vesta , Ceres or Pallas .
Another difference is that Interamnia &apos; s perihelion is located on the opposite side from the perihelia of the `` big four &apos; &apos; , so that Interamnia at perihelion is actually closer to the Sun than Ceres and Pallas are at the same longitude .
Even at a perihelic opposition its magnitude is only + 9.9 , which is over four magnitudes lower than Vesta .
It is probably the fifth most massive asteroid after Ceres , Vesta , Pallas , and Hygiea , with a mass estimated to be 1.2 % of the mass of the entire asteroid belt .
This also strongly suggests that Interamnia is large enough to have fully withstood all the collisions that have occurred in the asteroid belt since the Solar System was formed .
Its very dark surface and relatively large distance from the Sun means Interamnia can never be seen with 10x50 binoculars .

Bateson co-discovered genetic linkage with Reginald Punnett , and he and Punnett founded the Journal of Genetics in 1910 .
Bateson was the first to suggest the word `` genetics &apos; &apos; -LRB- from the Greek gennÅ , Î Î Î 1 \ / 2 Î 1 \ / 2 Ï ; to give birth -RRB- to describe the study of inheritance and the science of variation in a personal letter to Adam Sedgwick -LRB- 1854-1913 , a Cambridge zoologist , not to be confused with the geologist of that name who lived 1785-1873 -RRB- , dated April 18 , 1905 .
Bateson first used the term `` genetics &apos; &apos; publicly at the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in 1906 .
He was the first person to use the term genetics to describe the study of heredity and biological inheritance , and the chief populariser of the ideas of Gregor Mendel following their rediscovery in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns .
Bateson also coined the term `` epistasis &apos; &apos; to describe the genetic interaction of two independent traits .
William Bateson -LRB- Robin Hood &apos; s Bay , August 8 , 1861 -- February 8 , 1926 -RRB- was a British geneticist , a Fellow of St. John &apos; s College , Cambridge .
Although this was three years before Wilhelm Johannsen used the word `` gene &apos; &apos; to describe the units of hereditary information , De Vries had introduced the word `` pangene &apos; &apos; for the same concept already in 1889 and etymologically the word genetics finds its origin in Darwin &apos; s concept of pangenesis .

There are two sexes that look alike .
In most species , the sperm duct includes two or three spiny structures that presumably aid in copulation , although the details are unknown .
Kinorhynchans are segmented , limbless animals , with a body consisting of a head , neck , and a trunk of eleven segments .
These spines are used for locomotion , withdrawing the head and pushing forward , then gripping the substrate with the spines while drawing up the body .
Smaller ganglia are also located in the lateral and dorsal portions of each segment , but do not form distinct cords .
The larvae are free-living , but little else is known of their reproductive process .
Unlike some similar invertebrates , they do not have external cilia , but instead have a number of spines along the body , plus up to seven circles of spines around the head .
The nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord , with one ganglion in each segment , and an anterior nerve ring surrounding the pharynx .
A pair of gonads are located in the mid-region of the trunk , and open to pores in the final segment .
Their closest relatives are thought to be the phyla Loricifera and Priapulida .
Some species have simple ocelli on the head , and all species have tiny bristles on the body to provide a sense of touch .
The head is completely retractable , and is covered by a set of neck plates called placids when retracted .
The spines are essentially moveable extensions of the body wall , and are hollow and covered by cuticle .
The body wall consists of a thin syncitial layer , which secretes a tough cuticle ; this is molted several times while growing to adulthood .

The precise definition of an emergency , the agencies involved and the procedures used , vary by jurisdiction , and this is usually set by the government , whose agencies -LRB- emergency services -RRB- are responsible for emergency planning and management .
Some people believe they have an emergency in a situation that does not pose a risk to life , physical health , or property .
To grow a thicker and tougher shell required new ways to supply the embryo with oxygen , as diffusion alone was not enough .
After the egg developed these structures , further sophistication allowed amniotes to lay much bigger eggs in much drier habitats .
The skeletal remains of amniotes can be identified from their Labyrinthodont ancestors by their having at least two pairs of sacral ribs , a sternum in the pectoral girdle -LRB- some amniotes have lost it -RRB- and an astragalus bone in the ankle .
New habits and heavier bodies meant further evolution for the amniotes , both in behavior and anatomy .
In anapsids -LRB- turtles -RRB- there are none , in synapsids -LRB- mammals and their extinct relatives -RRB- there is one , and in most diapsids -LRB- non-anapsid reptiles , including dinosaurs and birds -RRB- there are two .
Their eggs could survive out of the water , allowing amniotes to branch out into drier environments .
The oldest known fossil synapsid is Protoclepsydrops from about 320 million years ago , while the oldest known sauropsid is probably Paleothyris , in the order Captorhinida , from the Middle Pennsylvanian epoch -LRB- ca . 306-312 million years ago -RRB- .
Very early in the evolutionary history of amniotes , basal amniotes evolved into two main lines of amniotes , the synapsids and the sauropsids , both of which persist into the modern era .
In amniotes the inner anatomy of the egg has evolved further and new structures have developed to take care of the gas exchanges between the embryo and the atmosphere , as well as dealing with the waste problems .
The amniotes spread across the globe and became the dominant land vertebrates .
One can assume the ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places , as such modest-sized animals would not have difficulty finding depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the ancient forests , and dry conditions were probably not the main reason why the soft shell emerged .
There are three main lines of amniotes , which may be distinguished by the structure of the skull and in particular the number of temporal fenestrae -LRB- openings -RRB- behind the eye .
The first amniotes -LRB- referred to as `` basal amniotes &apos; &apos; or `` stem amniotes &apos; &apos; -RRB- , such as Casineria , resembled small lizards and had evolved within reptiliomorphs which were amphibian about 340 million years ago , in the Carboniferous geologic period .
Real growth was not possible , however , until they stopped relying on small invertebrates as their main food source and started to eat plants or other vertebrates , or returned to the water .
In fish and amphibians there is only one inner membrane , also called an embryonic membrane .
Bigger eggs allowed for bigger offspring , and bigger adults could produce bigger eggs , so amniotes grew bigger than their ancestors .

For example , repeated applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of a â cents b â cents c = -LRB- a â cents b -RRB- â cents c = a â cents -LRB- b â cents c -RRB- generalizes to more than three factors .
To qualify as a group , the set and operation , , must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms :
Groups for which the equation a â cents b = b â cents a always holds are called abelian -LRB- in honor of Niels Abel -RRB- . Thus , the integer addition group is abelian , but the symmetry group in the following section is not .
In mathematics , a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element .
In other words , the result of combining element a with element b need not yield the same result as combining element b with element a ; the equation a â cents b = b â cents a may not always be true . This equation does always hold in the group of integers under addition , because a + b = b + a for any two integers -LRB- commutativity of addition -RRB- .

World War I reparations refers to the payments and transfers of property and equipment that Germany was forced to make under the Treaty of Versailles -LRB- 1919 -RRB- following its defeat during World War I. Article 231 of the Treaty -LRB- the so-called ` war guilt &apos; clause -RRB- declared Germany and its allies responsible for all ` loss and damage &apos; suffered by the Allies during the war and provided the basis for reparations .
There was extensive debate about the justice and likely impact of the reparations demands both before and after the publication and signing of the Treaty of Versailles and other Treaties in 1919 .
In addition , the Young Plan divided the annual payment , set at two billion Gold Marks , US $ 473 million , into two components , one unconditional part equal to one third of the sum and a postponable part for the remaining two-thirds .
Most famously , the principal representative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference , John Maynard Keynes , resigned from the Treasury in June 1919 in protest at the scale of the reparations demands , and subsequently protested publicly in the best-selling The Economic Consequences of the Peace -LRB- 1919 -RRB- .
In this , Stresemann was strongly supported by the British , and as an result of strong Anglo-German pressure , the French agreed to evacuate the Rhineland in June 1930 , five years ahead of schedule as the price of reducing German reparations .
Following German complaints that reparations payments under the Dawes Plan were too high , the Young Plan of 1928 , under which the Germans were to pay annuities of various amounts , but none to be higher than two and a quarter billion until 1988 .
The American historian Sally Marks commented the figure of 132 billion marks of reparations imposed by the London Conference of May 1921 was a highly misleading one Reparations were divided into A , B , and C bonds The bulk of the reparations were assigned to the C bonds , which were as Marks called `` chimerical &apos; &apos; as the Allies did not intend to collect the C bonds , which only existed to give the impression to French public opinion that substantial sums were going to be collected The Allies intended to collect only the A and B bonds , which totaled 50 billion marks , which was an amount that was slightly smaller than the 51 billion marks that the Germans had offered to pay Marks noted that as long as the French occupied the DÃ 1 \ / 4 sseldorf area in 1921 as an incentive to pay , the Germans paid all of their reparations in full and on time , and it was only after the French pulled out of DÃ 1 \ / 4 sseldorf in 1922 , that the Germans started to default on a regular basis .
In May 1929 , the Young Plan reduced further payments to 112 billion Gold Marks , US $ 26.6 billion over a period of 59 years -LRB- 1988 -RRB- .
Payments ceased when Adolf Hitler &apos; s National Socialist German Workers &apos; Party took power in 1933 , with about one-eighth of the initial reparations paid .
The 1924 Dawes Plan modified Germany &apos; s reparation payments .
In 2008 , the British historian Richard J. Evans argued that Keynes was simply wrong about reparations being unpayable , and instead contended that the responsibility for the great inflation of 1923 lay with the German government who preferred hyper-inflation to paying reparations Through the French did succeed in making their occupation of the Ruhr pay , the Germans through their `` passive resistance &apos; &apos; in the Ruhr and the Hyperinflation which wrecked their economy , won the world &apos; s sympathy , and under heavy Anglo-American financial pressure -LRB- the simultaneous decline in the value of the franc made the French very open to pressure from Wall Street and the City -RRB- , the French were forced to agree to the Dawes Plan of April 1924 , which substantially lowered German reparations payments .
In order to pay for the `` passive resistance &apos; &apos; in the Ruhr , the German government began the hyper-inflation that destroyed the German economy in 1923 .
Under the Dawes Plan , Germany paid only 1 billion marks in 1924 , and then increasing large sums for the next three years , until the total was to rise to 2 and quarter billion by 1927 . After 1927 , Germany was to make an annual payment of 2 and half billion marks .

Beginning with the 2007 â `` 2008 television season , the final 48 episodes would have been aired as three seasons with 16 episodes each , with Lost concluding in its sixth season .
Lindelof stated that the producers had a direct hand in the production of the season six promotional poster that was first displayed at Comic-Con , and that everything in it was intentional ; he also made a reference to the Abbey Road cover in connection to the poster .
The finale ran two-and-a-half hours starting at 9 \ / 8c ; pushing the local news back a half-hour , followed by the previously announced post-finale special , Jimmy Kimmel Live : Aloha to Lost , at 12 : 05 a.m. .
During Comic-Con 2009 , numerous sixth-season reports were made .
Unlike the latter half of the previous season , in which the cast was divided into two groups following two separate storylines , Season Six features an alternate universe scenario which the producers call `` flash-sideways , &apos; &apos; and almost all the main characters participate in both storylines .
Lindelof has also emphasized that the flashes-sideways are important , stating `` People are saying -LRB- they -RRB- do n &apos;t need these stories and all we can say is they &apos; re absolutely 100 percent necessary to tell the story of Lost , and hopefully by the end of the season it will be more obvious as to why . &apos; &apos;
Several new recurring characters were introduced in the sixth season .
Season six was the first and only season of Lost ever to not feature any kind of preview or official promotional material such as sneak peeks and promo pictures for future episodes since the Lost producers considered any single frame from the first episodes to be too revealing .
He also noted that the term `` flash-sideways &apos; &apos; was deliberately used instead of `` alternate reality &apos; &apos; because viewers might otherwise `` infer that one of them is n &apos;t real , or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real . &apos; &apos;
2 &apos; &apos; and `` Live Together , Die Alone Pt .
Harold Perrineau and Cynthia Watros , who portray Michael Dawson and Libby Smith , respectively , return in the second half of the season .
According to Lindelof , `` even a single scene from the show would basically tip what it is we &apos; re doing this year , and what it is we &apos; re doing this year is different than what we &apos; ve done in other years . &apos; &apos;
Lindelof and Cuse stated that securing the 2010 series-end date `` was immensely liberating &apos; &apos; and helped the series rediscover its focus .

Due to the writers &apos; strike , the fourth season featured 14 episodes , and season 5 had 17 episodes .
It was also claimed that a third of the way through the final season , the two timelines would be `` solidified into one &apos; &apos; and `` will be very linear â `` no more flashbacks , nothing ; &apos; &apos; however this did not become the case .
Carlton Cuse stated both the time travel and flash-forward seasons were over , and they were moving into something different for the sixth season .
Returning from the fifth season are the survivors &apos; leader Dr. Jack Shephard -LRB- Matthew Fox -RRB- ; former fugitive Kate Austen -LRB- Evangeline Lilly -RRB- ; millionaire Hugo `` Hurley &apos; &apos; Reyes -LRB- Jorge Garcia -RRB- ; former torturer Sayid Jarrah -LRB- Naveen Andrews -RRB- ; con artist James `` Sawyer &apos; &apos; Ford -LRB- Josh Holloway -RRB- ; medium Miles Straume -LRB- Ken Leung -RRB- ; former mob-enforcer Jin-Soo Kwon -LRB- Daniel Dae Kim -RRB- and his privileged wife Sun Kwon -LRB- Yunjin Kim -RRB- ; leader of the island &apos; s native population , known as the `` Others , &apos; &apos; Ben Linus -LRB- Michael Emerson -RRB- ; deceased crash survivor John Locke , who lives on in the sideways timeline but has been possessed in the original timeline by the mysterious Man In Black -LRB- Terry O &apos;Quinn -RRB- ; and former islander Desmond Hume -LRB- Henry Ian Cusick -RRB- , who starts the season off the island .
Matthew Fox said in an interview that in the final season , the characters of Jack Shephard and John Locke `` will come head to head . &apos; &apos;
About the return of Libby , Cuse stated , `` Finally , all of your questions -LRB- about Libby -RRB- will be answered &apos; &apos; , however , Lindelof jokingly responded , `` No , they will not &apos; &apos; .
Executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse stated that they `` always envisioned Lost as a show with a beginning , middle , and end , &apos; &apos; and that by announcing when the show would end that viewers would `` have the security of knowing that the story will play out as we &apos; ve intended . &apos; &apos;
Also , William Atherton was cast in a guest role as the principal of the school where Ben works .
Cuse and Lindelof stated that the Dharma Initiative would no longer play a large role in the show , but the `` Dharma-Michigan connection &apos; &apos; would play a significant role in season six .
The producers planned to wrap up mysteries , such as the reason the Dharma periodic resupply drops continue after the purge , Walt &apos; s unusual abilities , and the `` bird &apos; &apos; from `` Exodus Pt .
The season continues the stories of the survivors of the fictional September 22 , 2004 crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 on a mysterious island in the South Pacific .

Upon his election , KÃ hler , a conservative German patriot , said that `` Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites &apos; &apos; .
His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position .
KÃ hler was appointed Managing Director and Chairman of the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- in 2000 .
Germany &apos; s presidency is a largely ceremonial office , but is also invested with considerable moral authority .
After a two-year military service at a Panzergrenadier battalion in Ellwangen , he left the Bundeswehr as `` Leutnant der Reserve &apos; &apos; -LRB- reserve officer -RRB- .

In 1953 , they left the Soviet Zone â `` via West Berlin â `` to escape from the communist regime .
This came after German politicians criticised comments made by KÃ hler in relation to overseas military deployments :
The law , which aims to make it more difficult to access sites on the World Wide Web with child pornography , is considered by many legal experts to be unconstitutional .
The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself .
Horst KÃ hler &apos; s parents , ethnic Germans and Romanian citizens , had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940 during the Nazi-Soviet population transfers that followed the invasion of Poland and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , which awarded Bessarabia to the Soviet Union .

This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005 .
In that capacity , he served as a `` sherpa &apos; &apos; -LRB- personal representative -RRB- for Chancellor Helmut Kohl , preparing G7 summits and other international economic conferences .
From 2004 until early 2006 , Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany , whilst Schloss Bellevue was being renovated .
He was reelected to a second term on 23 May 2009 .
The following year , KÃ hler was made head of the Ministers office in the Federal Ministry of Finance , upon Stoltenberg &apos; s recommendation .
His daughter , who suffers from retinitis pigmentosa , became blind as a teenager .
KÃ hler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favoring an unconstitutional position .
This can only be done by the German states .
Just a year later , on 31 May 2010 , he resigned from his office in a controversy over his comment on the role of the German Bundeswehr in light of a visit to the troops in Afghanistan .
KÃ hler was born in SkierbieszÃ w -LRB- then named Heidenstein -RRB- , in the General Government area of German-occupied Poland , as the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard KÃ hler , into a family of Bessarabian Germans from RÃ Å cani in Romanian Bessarabia -LRB- near BÄ lÅ # i , present-day Moldova -RRB- .
In 1998 he was appointed president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , and settled in London , where the headquarters of the bank is located .
KÃ hler defeated Gesine Schwan on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580 ; 20 votes were cast for minor candidates , while one elector was absent because of a heart attack .
He lived in Washington , D.C. , from 2000 to 2004 .
KÃ hler is an economist by profession .
A member of the CDU since 1981 , he was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993 , and as such , the administrative head of the Ministry and the deputy of the Federal Minister of Finance -LRB- Theodor Waigel -RRB- .
There had only been six previous occasions when Germany &apos; s president had chosen to reject bills , in most instances less important legislation was involved .
Horst KÃ hler -LRB- ; born 22 February 1943 -RRB- is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union .
KÃ hler joined the civil service in 1976 , when he was employed in the Federal Ministry of Economics .
He rose to head of department in 1987 , with responsibility for financial policy and federal industrial interests .
Although the office of President is less influential than that of the Chancellor and is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters , KÃ hler was a highly popular politician during his tenure .
On 23 May 2009 he was re-elected by the Federal Assembly , and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009 .
The government of Gerhard SchrÃ der nominated him after their first nominee , Caio Koch-Weser , was rejected by the United States .
He studied and finally earned a doctorate in economics and political sciences from Eberhard Karls University of TÃ 1 \ / 4 bingen , where he was a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research from 1969 to 1976 .
In 1981 , he was employed in the Chancellory of the state government in Schleswig-Holstein under Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg .
He subsequently stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia .
Horst KÃ hler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee .
He also served as the primary German negotiator in the Maastricht Treaty negotiations .
Horst KÃ hler is married to Eva KÃ hler , a teacher .
After coming under criticism for his statements that Germanyâ s military missions abroad also served to secure trade , critics accused him of advocating the use of `` gunboat diplomacy &apos; &apos; .
One of Ganesha &apos; s names in the Ganesha Purana and the Ganesha Sahasranama is Buddhipriya . This name also appears in a list of 21 names at the end of the Ganesha Sahasranama that Ganesha says are especially important .
He may have been created by Shiva , or by Parvati , or by Shiva and Parvati , or appeared mysteriously and was discovered by Shiva and Parvati .
In another story , when Ganesha was born , his mother , Parvati , showed off her new baby to the other gods .
At least two different versions of the Ganesha Sahasranama exist ; one version is drawn from the Ganesha Purana , a Hindu scripture venerating Ganesha .
Rosary beads are at times used to say Roman Catholic rosary based prayers which do not primarily involve the Hail Mary and the mysteries of the rosary .
A rosary bracelet is one with ten beads and often a cross or medal as well . The most modern form is the rosary card .
The rosary is part of the Catholic veneration of Mary , which has been promoted by numerous popes , especially Leo XIII , known as `` The Rosary Pope &apos; &apos; , who issued twelve encyclicals and five apostolic letters on the rosary and added the invocation Queen of the most Holy Rosary to the Litany of Loreto . Pope Pius V introduced the rosary into the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar as the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary , celebrated on October 7 .

Lennon did participate in this session .
Additional vocals were added in an overdub session on 30 July 1969 , the same day the first trial edit of the side two medley was created .
The two songs were recorded together as a single piece , and both were written by Paul McCartney -LRB- credited to Lennon \ / McCartney -RRB- .
McCartney said , `` I remember trying to get a very strong vocal on it , because it was such a gentle theme , so I worked on the strength of the vocal on it , and ended up quite pleased with it . &apos; &apos;
On 15 August , orchestral overdubs were made to `` Golden Slumbers &apos; &apos; and five other songs on Abbey Road .
`` Golden Slumbers &apos; &apos; is a song by The Beatles , part of the climactic medley on their 1969 album Abbey Road .

He was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Scotland on 1 July 1969 , and was hospitalised there until 6 July .
John Lennon was not present .
He begins the song in a soft tone appropriate for a lullaby , with piano , bass guitar , and string section accompaniment .
The song begins the progression that leads to the end of the album and is followed by `` Carry That Weight . &apos; &apos;

The typical use pregnancy rate among condom users varies depending on the population being studied , ranging from 10 â `` 18 % per year .
In popular tradition , the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of England &apos; s King Charles II , one `` Dr. Condom &apos; &apos; or `` Earl of Condom &apos; &apos; .
Actual use , or typical use effectiveness rates are of all condom users , including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse .
Condoms are usually supplied with a lubricant coating to facilitate penetration , while flavored condoms are principally used for oral sex . As mentioned above , most condoms are made of latex , but polyurethane and lambskin condoms are also widely available .
The perfect use pregnancy rate of condoms is 2 % per year .
Additionally , latex allergy precludes use of latex condoms and is one of the principal reasons for the use of other materials .

Wenedyk also has a vocative case .
Wenedyk does not have articles .
Wenedyk vocabulary as published on the internet consists of over 4000 words .
A preposition and a pronoun are generally treated as one word , and therefore , when the pronoun has only one syllable , the preposition is stressed .
In most cases it has the same form as the direct case , but there are exceptions : O potrze !
Da nÃ w odzej nostry paÅ kocidzany .
Stress almost always falls on the penultimate syllable .
The following charts of 30 shows what Wenedyk looks like in comparison to a number of other Romance languages ; note that unlike Brithenig , where one-quarter of the words resembled Welsh words , only four Wenedyk words -LRB- not counting szkoÅ a , borrowed into Polish from Latin -RRB- resemble Polish words , due to the Slavic languages &apos; greater distance from the Romance languages compared to the Celtic languages :
This is a feature that distinguishes Wenedyk from all natural Romance languages and also from other Romance-based constructed languages languages like Esperanto and Ido .

Thus , people are unaware of the fact that they have buried memories or traumatic experiences .
The origin of Freud &apos; s early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to Josef Breuer .
Patients were generally unconvinced that their experiences of Freud &apos; s clinical procedure indicated actual sexual abuse .
Classically , the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk in free association and to talk about dreams .
The Oedipus conflict was described as a state of psychosexual development and awareness .
In this period he came under the influence of his friend and confidant Wilhelm Fliess , who recommended cocaine for the treatment of the so-called `` nasal reflex neurosis &apos; &apos; .
Freud also argued that the act of repression did not take place within a person &apos; s consciousness .
He noted finding many cases in which apparent memories of childhood sexual abuse were based more on imagination than on real events .
Freud argued for the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought and behavior .
The application as an anesthetic turned out to be one of the few safe uses of cocaine , and as reports of addiction and overdose began to filter in from many places in the world , Freud &apos; s medical reputation became somewhat tarnished .
Freud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique .
However , following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again .
Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously , and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom .
The preconscious was described as a layer between conscious and unconscious thought ; its contents could be accessed with a little effort .
Freud also believed that the libido developed in individuals by changing its object , a process codified by the concept of sublimation .
He found that while nursing her dying father she had developed a number of transitory symptoms , including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs , which he also diagnosed as hysterical .
In his later work , Freud proposed that the human psyche could be divided into three parts : Id , ego , and super-ego .
He further argued that , as humans develop , they become fixated on different and specific objects through their stages of developmentâ &apos; &apos; first in the oral stage -LRB- exemplified by an infant &apos; s pleasure in nursing -RRB- , then in the anal stage -LRB- exemplified by a toddler &apos; s pleasure in evacuating his or her bowels -RRB- , then in the phallic stage .
After opening his own medical practice , specializing in neurology , Freud married Martha Bernays in 1886 .
He reported that even after a supposed `` reproduction &apos; &apos; of sexual scenes the patients assured him emphatically of their disbelief .
Freud has been influential in two related but distinct ways : he simultaneously developed a theory of the human mind &apos; s organization and internal operations and a theory that human behavior both conditions and results from how the mind is organized .
The goal of Freudian therapy , or psychoanalysis , was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into consciousness in order to free the patient from suffering repetitive distorted emotions .
Freud argued that children then passed through a stage in which they fixated on the mother as a sexual object -LRB- known as the Oedipus Complex -RRB- but that the child eventually overcame and repressed this desire because of its taboo nature .
Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent , and observed that she entered states of absence .
The rational ego attempts to exact a balance between the impractical hedonism of the id and the equally impractical moralism of the super-ego ; it is the part of the psyche that is usually reflected most directly in a person &apos; s actions .
The id is the impulsive , child-like portion of the psyche that operates on the `` pleasure principle &apos; &apos; and only takes into account what it wants and disregards all consequences .
One key factor in the operation of the unconscious is `` repression &apos; &apos; .
Freud also recommended cocaine as a cure for morphine addiction .
Freud credited Breuer with opening the way to the discovery of the psychoanalytical method by his treatment of the case of Anna O. In November 1880 Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman -LRB- Bertha Pappenheim -RRB- for a persistent cough which he diagnosed as hysterical .
`` I found in myself a constant love for my mother , and jealousy of my father .
Freud discussed this model in the 1920 essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle , and fully elaborated upon it in The Ego and the Id -LRB- 1923 -RRB- , in which he developed it as an alternative to his previous topographic schema -LRB- i.e. , conscious , unconscious , and preconscious -RRB- .
Despite this change in his explanatory model , Freud always recognized that some neurotics had in fact been sexually abused by their fathers .
Yet , as historian of psychology Mark Altschule concluded , `` It is difficultâ &apos; &apos; or perhaps impossibleâ &apos; &apos; to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious cerebration as not only real but of the highest importance . &apos; &apos;
He argued that humans are born `` polymorphously perverse &apos; &apos; , meaning that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure .
During the late 1890s Freud , who never abandoned his belief in the sexual etiology of neuroses , began to emphasize fantasies built around the Oedipus complex as the primary cause of hysteria and other neurotic symptoms .
Freud originally posited childhood sexual abuse as a general explanation for the origin of neuroses , but he abandoned this so-called `` seduction theory &apos; &apos; as insufficiently explanatory .
Another version of events focuses on Freud &apos; s proposing that unconscious memories of infantile sexual abuse were at the root of the psychoneuroses in letters to Wilhelm Fliess in October 1895 , before he reported that he had actually discovered such abuse among his patients .
Freud believed that many people `` repress &apos; &apos; painful memories deep into their unconscious mind .
The repressive or dormant latency stage of psychosexual development preceded the sexually mature genital stage of psychosexual development .
I now consider this to be a universal event in childhood , &apos; &apos; Freud said .
He explicitly discussed several patients whom he knew to have been abused .
He theorized that personality is developed by a person &apos; s childhood experiences .
Freud believed that people are driven by two conflicting central desires : the life drive -LRB- libido or Eros -RRB- -LRB- survival , propagation , hunger , thirst , and sex -RRB- and the death drive .
He used the Oedipus conflict to point out how much he believed that people desire incest and must repress that desire .
Freud developed his first topology of the psyche in The Interpretation of Dreams -LRB- 1899 -RRB- in which he proposed that the unconscious exists and described a method for gaining access to it .
Freud hoped to prove that his model was universally valid and thus turned to ancient mythology and contemporary ethnography for comparative material .
Freud sought to anchor this pattern of development in the dynamics of the mind .
Later , Freud distinguished between three concepts of the unconscious : the descriptive unconscious , the dynamic unconscious , and the system unconscious .
Freud named his new theory the Oedipus complex after the famous Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex by Sophocles .
This led him to favor certain clinical techniques for trying to help cure mental illness .
He found that when , with his encouragement , she told fantasy stories in her evening states of absence her condition improved , and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881 .

Adaptive immunity is triggered in vertebrates when a pathogen evades the innate immune system and generates a threshold level of antigen .
It is adaptive immunity because the body &apos; s immune system prepares itself for future challenges .
The adaptive immune response provides the vertebrate immune system with the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens -LRB- to generate immunity -RRB- , and to mount stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered .
The adaptive immune system is composed of highly specialized , systemic cells and processes that eliminate or prevent pathogenic challenges .
Thought to have arisen in the first jawed vertebrates , the adaptive or `` specific &apos; &apos; immune system is activated by the â non-specific â and evolutionarily older innate immune system -LRB- which is the major system of host defense against pathogens in nearly all other living things -RRB- .

When humans go out to get food or homes , that is studied in `` economics &apos; &apos; , but when non-humans do it , that is `` ecology &apos; &apos; , though it is clear that there are motivations , methods and certainly bodily needs in common .
See value of Earth article for that and other examples of this extreme case of ecosystem valuation - biosphere valuation .
Ecology itself is also human perception , and such related concepts as a food chain are constructed by humans to help them understand ecosystems .
Studies compiled by ecologist Robert Costanza in the 1990s argued strongly that even just considering the most basic seventeen of these services , the combined value of the ecosystems of the earth was worth more -LRB- US $ 33T -RRB- each year than the whole human exchange economy -LRB- US $ 25T -RRB- at that time -LRB- 1995 -RRB- .
More complex arguments in ecosystem valuation regard environmental ethics and deep ecology . Economists and some ecologists concentrate upon nature &apos; s services and the assignment of values in a service economy to all that Nature does `` for humans &apos; &apos; .
Some versions of conflict theory focus on the role of resource scarcity in sparking or propagating human conflicts - in effect holding that the resources or ecosystems they fight over are being held so valuable that they are worth considerable risk of harm to control .
It may be anthropocentric to do so , since `` valuation &apos; &apos; more clearly refers to a human perception rather than being an `` objective &apos; &apos; attribute of the system perceived .
Considering `` valuation &apos; &apos; as an `` economic not ecological issue &apos; &apos; reflects the way these fields divide of the activities of humans versus non-humans in `` making a living &apos; &apos; .
Ecosystem valuation is a widely used tool in determining the impact of human activities on an environmental system , by assigning an economic value to an ecosystem or its ecosystem services .
Thus , a price can be put on the natural capital of an ecosystem based on the price of natural resources it yields each year .
The simplest form of ecosystem valuation for economists is to hold that an ecosystem has a value equivalent to its ecological yield valued as it would be on commodity markets : for the value of water , wood , fish or game , that is purified or nurseried or generated or harboured in that ecosystem . Thus , a price can be put on the natural capital of an ecosystem based on the price of natural resources it yields each year .
Since animals do not put explicit prices on ecosystems they use , but do behave as if they are valuable , e.g. by selecting one territory vs. another , defending their territories , etc , it is mostly a matter of definition whether ecology should include valuation as an issue .
In many cases by those who hold that markets and pricing exist independently of any individual human observers and `` users &apos; &apos; , and especially those who deem markets to be `` out of control &apos; &apos; , ecosystem valuation is considered a -LRB- marginal , ignored -RRB- part of economics .
This is at least a relative notion of value and value at risk applied to ecosystem .
Methods to place a monetary value on ecosystem services where there are no market prices include `` stated preference &apos; &apos; methods and `` revealed preference &apos; &apos; methods .
Natural capital and individual capital are studied ecology as living systems , however , this does not extend to the economics of valuation by which they are related :
Stated preference methods , such as the contingent valuation method ask people for their willingness to pay for a certain ecosystem -LRB- service -RRB- .
Such valuation , and that of the effectiveness of various environmental health measures that affect the value of life and quality of life , are usually thought to be part of economics .
The simplest form of ecosystem valuation for economists is to hold that an ecosystem has a value equivalent to its ecological yield valued as it would be on commodity markets : for the value of water , wood , fish or game , that is purified or nurseried or generated or harboured in that ecosystem .
In Natural Capitalism , 1999 , Paul Hawken , Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins advanced an argument to assign the value of Earth in current currency .
Revealed preference methods , such as hedonic pricing and the travel cost method , use a relation with a market good or service to estimate the willingness-to-pay for the service .
Other studies have focused on the marginal value of ecosystem changes , which can be used in cost-benefit analysis of environmental policies .

There are two main types of this kind of potential energy : electrostatic potential energy , electrodynamic potential energy -LRB- also sometimes called magnetic potential energy -RRB- .
An object at a certain height above the Moon &apos; s surface has less gravitational potential energy than at the same height above the Earth &apos; s surface because the Moon &apos; s gravity is weaker . Note that `` height &apos; &apos; in the common sense of the term can not be used for gravitational potential energy calculations when gravity is not assumed to be a constant .
Chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction .
Thus , a book lying on a table has less gravitational potential energy than the same book on top of a taller cupboard , and less gravitational potential energy than a heavier book lying on the same table . An object at a certain height above the Moon &apos; s surface has less gravitational potential energy than at the same height above the Earth &apos; s surface because the Moon &apos; s gravity is weaker .
The factors that affect an object &apos; s gravitational potential energy are its height relative to some reference point , its mass , and the strength of the gravitational field it is in .
Gravitational energy is the potential energy associated with gravitational force .
Instead , it is stored as potential energy .

In the following centuries Pavia was an important and active town .
In the political division between Guelphs and Ghibellines that characterizes the Italian Middle Ages , Pavia was traditionally Ghibelline , a position that was as much supported by the rivalry with Milan as it was a mark of the defiance of the Emperor that led the Lombard League against the emperor Frederick Barbarossa , who was attempting to reassert long-dormant Imperial influence over Italy .
In the 12th century Pavia acquired the status of a self-governing commune .
Pavia remained the capital of the Italian Kingdom and the center of royal coronations until the diminution of imperial authority there in the 12th century .
The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713 at the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession .
The Battle of Pavia -LRB- 1525 -RRB- marks a watershed in the city &apos; s fortunes , since by that time , the former cleavage between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party -LRB- allied with the Pope -RRB- and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain Charles V. Thus during the Valois-Habsburg Italian Wars , Pavia was naturally on the Imperial -LRB- and Spanish -RRB- side .
After the Lombards conquest , Pavia became the capital of their kingdom -LRB- AD .
It continued to function as the administrative center of the kingdom , but by the reign of Desiderius , it had deteriorated as a first-rate defensive work and Charlemagne took it in the Siege of Pavia -LRB- June , 774 -RRB- assuming the kingship of the Lombards .

The term ZIP code was originally registered as a servicemark -LRB- a type of trademark -RRB- by the U.S. Postal Service , but its registration has since expired .
In 1983 , the U.S. Postal Service began using an expanded ZIP code system called ZIP + 4 , often called `` plus-four codes &apos; &apos; , `` add-on codes &apos; &apos; , or `` add ons . &apos; &apos;
ZIP codes are a system of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service -LRB- USPS -RRB- since 1963 .
The term ZIP , an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan , is properly written in capital letters and was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently , and therefore more quickly , when senders use the code in the postal address .
This software processes a user-input ZIP code and returns a list of store or business locations , usually in order of increasing distance from the center of the input ZIP code . As the ZIP system is confined to the U.S. Postal network , websites that require ZIP codes can not register international customers .
ZIP codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of U.S. states , the second and third digits together representing a region in that group -LRB- or perhaps a large city -RRB- and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region .
These were to be written with both letters capitalized .
The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning .
The main town in a region -LRB- if applicable -RRB- often gets the first ZIP codes for that region ; afterward , the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order .
An extended ZIP + 4 code , introduced in the 1980s , includes the five digits of the ZIP code , a hyphen , and four more digits that determine a more precise location than the ZIP code alone .
A ZIP + 4 code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area , such as a city block , a group of apartments , an individual high-volume receiver of mail or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery .

It is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation .
The moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational dynamics as mass does in linear dynamics , describing the relationship between angular momentum and angular velocity , torque and angular acceleration , and several other quantities .
The symbol I and sometimes J are usually used to refer to the moment of inertia or polar moment of inertia .

If a Church recognizes that another Church , with which it lacks bonds of pastoral governance , shares with it some of the beliefs and essential practices of Christianity , it may speak of `` partial communion &apos; &apos; between it and the other Church .
The term Communion is derived from Latin communio -LRB- sharing in common -RRB- .
In a special way the term communion is applied to sharing in the Eucharist by partaking of the consecrated bread and wine , an action seen as entering into a particularly close relationship with Christ .
In addition , the noun is found in some manuscripts -LRB- used for producing the English translation known as the King James Version , but not for more recent translations -RRB- in .
An example is the Anglican Communion .
However , the term `` full communion &apos; &apos; is frequently used in a broader sense , to refer instead to a relationship between Christian Churches that are not united , but have only entered into an arrangement whereby members of each Church have certain rights within the other .
By metonymy , the term is used of a group of Christian Churches that have this close relationship of communion with each other .
The corresponding term in Greek is Î Î Î Î 1 \ / 2 Ï Î 1 \ / 2 Î Î , which is often translated as `` fellowship &apos; &apos; .
The communion of saints is the relationship that , according to the belief of Christians , exists between them as people made holy by their link with Christ .
If the relationship between the Churches is complete , involving fulness of `` those bonds of communion - faith , sacraments and pastoral governance - that permit the Faithful to receive the life of grace within the Church &apos; &apos; , it is called full communion .
This relationship is generally understood to extend not only to those still in earthly life , but also to those who have gone past death to be `` at home with the Lord &apos; &apos; -LRB- 2 Corinthians 5 : 8 -RRB- .
In the Bible , the Greek term Î Î Î Î 1 \ / 2 Ï Î 1 \ / 2 Î Î -LRB- koinonia -RRB- is an exclusively New Testament term , appearing nowhere in the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint .

It officially started on May 15 , 1985 in the eastern Pacific , and on June 1 , 1985 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1985 .

It eventually dissipated due to hostile conditions on the 24th , without ever impacting land .
There was no damage reported .
It was the first usage for this name .
Xina peaked as a minimal major hurricane on October 29 .
Later during the 80 &apos; s , the added names were made a permanent part of the Eastern Pacific lists , and other names were added for even-numbered years .
At the time , the 1985 season was the most active on record in the eastern north Pacific , with 25 tropical cyclones forming .
The name `` Dolores &apos; &apos; was misspelled as `` Delores &apos; &apos; in 1991 .
As it finished the loop and left the cover of the anticyclone , Xina started falling apart .
This is the same list used for the 1979 season , except for the added names .
Of those , 22 were named , 12 reaching hurricane intensity and 8 becoming major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale .
Cool waters took their toll on the cyclone , and Xina dissipated on November 5 .

Xina began to start tracing out a huge oblong loop beneath an anticyclone .
It strengthened into Tropical Storm Xina early October 27 .
It threatened the islands enough to prompt a hurricane watch being issued , but the hurricane turned away .
Despite the activity , there were few notable systems this year .
Had the list of names not been extended , Xina would have been named `` Alpha &apos; &apos; instead .
The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1985 .
No names were retired , so it was used again in the 1991 season .

In telecommunication , a Hamming code is a linear error-correcting code named after its inventor , Richard Hamming .
The key thing about Hamming Codes that can be seen from visual inspection is that any given bit is included in a unique set of parity bits . To check for errors , check all of the parity bits .
To start with , he developed a nomenclature to describe the system , including the number of data bits and error-correction bits in a block . For instance , parity includes a single bit for any data word , so assuming ASCII words with 7-bits , Hamming described this as an -LRB- 8,7 -RRB- code , with eight bits in total , of which 7 are data .
For each integer there is a code with parity bits and data bits .
In mathematical terms , Hamming codes are a class of binary linear codes .
If only one parity bit indicates an error , the parity bit itself is in error .
By contrast , the simple parity code can not correct errors , and can only detect an odd number of errors .

In everyday conversation , and in informal literature , it is common to see lengths measured in units of objects of which everyone knows the approximate width .
Common examples are :
Some women are hoodwinked into believing promises of a better life , sometimes by people who are known and trusted to them .
Regarding the prostitution of children the laws on prostitution as well as those on sex with a child apply .
In some countries counseling , accommodation , specialist care exists for trafficked people to help them escape , whilst in other countries , this support is lacking and individuals are often treated as illegal immigrants and deported .
In countries where prostitution is legal , advertising it may be legal -LRB- as in the Netherlands -RRB- or illegal -LRB- as in India -RRB- .
It is common , particularly in Eastern Europe , that should they manage to return to their families they will only be trafficked once again .
Poverty , social exclusion and war are at the heart of human trafficking .
Children are sold into the global sex trade every year .
Once overseas it is common for their passport to be confiscated by the trafficker and to be warned of the consequences should they attempt to escape , including beatings , rape , threats of violence against their family and death threats .
One of the most serious problems associated with prostitution is the fact that the sex trade is surrounded by illegal , abusive and dangerous activities . One view maintains that such situations occur because prostitution is kept illegal and the industry operates on the black market .

Some jurisdictions outlaw the act of prostitution -LRB- the exchange of sexual services for money -RRB- ; other countries do not prohibit prostitution itself , but ban the activities typically associated with it -LRB- soliciting in a public place , operating a brothel , pimping etc . -RRB- , making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law ; while in a few countries prostitution is legal and regulated .
Another , however , believes that legalizing and regulating prostitution does not improve the situation , but instead makes it worse , creating a parallel illegal prostitution industry , and failing to dissociate the legal part of the sex trade from crime .

Prostitution is one of the branches of the sex industry . The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country , from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession .
Often they are kidnapped or orphaned , and sometimes they are sold by their own families .
Traffickers may own legitimate travel agencies , modeling agencies and employment offices in order to gain women &apos; s trust .
â Annually , according to U.S. Government-sponsored research completed in 2006 , approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders , which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries .

The college was founded in 1448 by Margaret of Anjou -LRB- the Queen of Henry VI -RRB- , and refounded in 1465 by Elizabeth Woodville -LRB- the Queen of Edward IV -RRB- .
This is why nuts and bolts can be seen in the bridge today .

The act declares the program &apos; s purpose as follows : To promote world peace and friendship through a Peace Corps , which shall make available to interested countries and areas men and women of the United States qualified for service abroad and willing to serve , under conditions of hardship if necessary , to help the peoples of such countries and areas in meeting their needs for trained manpower .
The first public law establishing Peace Corps in the US Code was The Peace Corps Act passed by the 87th Congress and signed into law on September 22 , 1961 .
The Peace Corps website answered the question `` Who Inspired the Creation of the Peace Corps ? &apos; &apos;
It was established by Executive Order 10924 on March 1 , 1961 , and authorized by the Congress on September 22 , 1961 , with passage of the Peace Corps Act -LRB- Public Law 87-293 -RRB- .
Since 1961 , over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps and have served in 139 countries . Many former volunteers have risen to national prominence , not least the four who have served as Peace Corps Directors .

This provides an energy saving of 5 % and makes the trains run 9 % faster .
The Private Bill necessary for construction was introduced into Parliament in 1955 .
`` Same-direction &apos; &apos; cross-platform interchanges are available at Stockwell -LRB- with the Northern line -RRB- , Oxford Circus -LRB- with the Bakerloo line -RRB- , Highbury &amp; Islington -LRB- with First Capital Connect , originally the Northern City Line -RRB- and at Finsbury Park -LRB- with the Piccadilly line -RRB- .
There have been station closures for safety reasons , when both escalators have been unserviceable .
When the Victoria line was constructed , severe budget restrictions were imposed and as a result the station infrastructure standards were lower than on older lines and on later extension projects .
At Euston , northbound Victoria and Northern line -LRB- Bank branch -RRB- trains run along adjacent platforms , although they travel in opposite directions .
In the early planning stages of the line an articulated type of rolling stock was considered but the idea was dropped because of difficulties in transferring the stock to Acton Works for heavy overhauls .
In some cases this was achieved by placing the Victoria line platforms on either side of the existing station , while in others the Victoria line uses one of the older platforms and the existing line was diverted into a new platform .
It is the only line on the Underground , except for the two-station Waterloo &amp; City line , that is operated entirely underground , the only section of track to emerge above ground being the part from Seven Sisters to the line &apos; s depot at Northumberland Park .
With the demise of Acton Works this requirement no longer exists and the new 2009 tube stock has a wider profile and slightly longer carriages which preclude it running on other deep-level tube lines .
Every Victoria line station apart from Pimlico was built as an interchange station , and several existing stations were rearranged to allow for cross-platform interchange with the new line .
Supporters of Tottenham Hotspur -LRB- and the club itself -RRB- have campaigned for a surface station to be built next to Northumberland Park Station , adjacent to the line &apos; s depot .
In normal service all trains run from Brixton to Seven Sisters with roughly three out of five continuing to Walthamstow Central .
The line is equipped with an Automatic Train Operation system -LRB- ATO -RRB- ; the train operator -LRB- driver -RRB- closes the train doors and presses a pair of `` start &apos; &apos; buttons , and if the way ahead is clear , the ATO drives the train at a safe speed to the next station and stops it there .
However , it would be expensive and can not currently be justified on cost-benefit grounds .
The official opening ceremony took place at Victoria station on 7 March 1969 : Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a commemorative plaque on the station concourse .
The replacement for the line &apos; s 1967 Tube Stock will be the 2009 Tube Stock built by Bombardier Transportation .
There was no initial opening ceremony : instead the normal timetable started on Sunday 1 September 1968 .
Herne Hill station would be on a large reversing loop with one platform .
Examples of these lower standards include narrower than usual platforms and undecorated ceilings at Walthamstow Central , Blackhorse Road and Tottenham Hale , adversely affecting lighting levels .
It is colored light blue on the Tube map and , in terms of the average number of journeys per mile , is the busiest line on the network .
183 million passengers use the Victoria line each year making it the fourth busiest line on the network .
This system has operated since the line opened in 1968 , making the Victoria line the world &apos; s first full-scale automatic railway .
Barbara Castle , the Minister of Transport , gave approval on 4 August 1967 for the Brixton extension to be built .
Replacement of the 1967 stock began on July 2009 as part of Transport for London &apos; s 5-year Â # 10 billion redevelopment project .
There was also a proposal , although this was not included in the Bill , for a subsequent extension from Victoria to Fulham Broadway station on the District line .
This would improve the football ground &apos; s transport links , seen as essential if the club &apos; s wish to redevelop their ground and increase its capacity is to become a reality .
Information posters on the new trains state that from early 2010 a new train will be introduced every two weeks .
Each platform constructed specifically for the Victoria line from new is 132.6 m long .
Trains run every two minutes during peak periods .
These are currently being replaced by 2009 Tube Stock -LRB- see below -RRB- .
A new tube railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948 .
This would remove a critical capacity restriction by eliminating the need for trains to reverse at Brixton .
Each station was decorated with tiled motifs in seating recesses to help identify the station .
During the construction of the Jubilee line in the late 1970s , the original motifs on Green Park station were replaced by motifs matching the new design for the Jubilee line platforms .
The first train left Walthamstow Central for Highbury &amp; Islington at about 6.30 am .
It is not clear from Transport for London &apos; s Five-Year Investment Programme whether these shortcomings are likely to be remedied .
At most stations there is still a concrete staircase between the up and down escalators , where an additional escalator could be installed .
After a short ceremony , Her Majesty bought a 5d ticket -LRB- five old pence = 2.08 p -RRB- and traveled to Green Park .
During the planning stages , it was known as Route C and then was named the Victoria line after Victoria Station by David McKenna , whose suggestion was seconded by Sir John Elliot .
When the line was opened it was served by a fleet of 8 car -LRB- carriage -RRB- trains of 1967 Tube Stock trains .
These were later supplemented by a number of cars of 1972 Mark I Tube Stock converted to be compatible with the 1967 stock .
The first section to be opened was between Walthamstow Central and Highbury &amp; Islington .
However , a late decision in 1961 saw the line cut back to Walthamstow -LRB- Hoe Street -RRB- station which was renamed Walthamstow Central in 1968 .
The first prototypes were built in 2006 and tested out of service from 2008 , the main fleet introduced into revenue service from 2009 to 2012 .
All Victoria line stations were originally tiled in a nondescript cool blue \ / grey color fashionable at the time .
The Victoria line was designed to relieve congestion on other lines , in particular the Piccadilly line , as well as to maximize possible interchanges .
Construction work began in 1962 on the Walthamstow â &apos; &apos; Victoria section and continued until 1972 , when Pimlico station was opened .
The main purpose of the line was to relieve congestion in the central area .
The Bill described a line from Victoria to Walthamstow -LRB- Wood Street -RRB- .
Preparatory work had already started at a site at Bessborough Gardens near Vauxhall Bridge Road in May 1967 , and on 28 June 1968 Richard Marsh , then Minister of Transport , approved the proposal to build a station at Pimlico .
The name `` Victoria line &apos; &apos; dates back to 1955 ; other suggestions were `` Walvic line &apos; &apos; -LRB- Walthamstow - Victoria -RRB- and `` Viking line &apos; &apos; -LRB- Victoria - King &apos; s Cross -RRB- .
However in recent years an additional escalator has been installed in place of the fixed stairway at Brixton -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and Vauxhall -LRB- 2006 -RRB- .
The idea was looked into , but Network Rail own the necessary land and need it for their own expansion plans .
If the Chelseaâ `` Hackney line were to be built it would relieve a lot of congestion on the Victoria line , offering an alternative route across Central London between Victoria and King &apos; s Cross St. Pancras .
Later that year , the section between Highbury &amp; Islington and Warren Street was opened , again without ceremony .
Over many years , heavy equipment has been installed in unsightly fenced-off sections at the ends of platforms owing to the lack of anywhere else to install them .
The Victoria line is a deep-level London Underground line running from the south -LRB- Zone 2 -RRB- to the north-east -LRB- Zone 3 -RRB- of London .
Princess Alexandra opened the Brixton extension on 23 July 1971 , making a journey from Brixton to Vauxhall .
A test tunnel from Tottenham to Manor House under Seven Sisters Road had been constructed in 1959 and this was later integrated into the running tunnels .
The signalling will also be replaced with a more modern ATO system from Westinghouse Rail Systems during the Victoria line upgrade .
For many years there have been proposals to extend the line one stop southwards from Brixton to Herne Hill .
It had been intended to build the line beyond Walthamstow Central to Wood Street -LRB- Walthamstow -RRB- , where it would have surfaced to terminate next to the British Railways station .
The lack of a third escalator can cause severe congestion at peak times .
Ultimately there were 43 trains each of which were made up of two four-car units .
The line has hump-backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they slow down and release it when they leave a station .
Because the current line is heavily overcrowded this is considered to be the only extension proposal with any realistic prospect of coming to fruition ; but to have any hope of being built , it would have to be seen to be effective in reducing overcrowding -LRB- by enabling trains to run more frequently -RRB- and not to increase it .
Their names are derived from their staining characteristics ; for example , the most abundant granulocyte is the neutrophil granulocyte , which has neutrally-staining cytoplasmic granules .
Granulocytes are a category of white blood cells characterized by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm .
In common parlance , the term polymorphonuclear leukocyte often refers specifically to neutrophil granulocytes , the most abundant of the granulocytes .
Other white blood cells which are not granulocytes -LRB- `` agranulocytes &apos; &apos; -RRB- are mainly lymphocytes and monocytes .
They are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes -LRB- PMN or PML -RRB- because of the varying shapes of the nucleus , which is usually lobed into three segments .

The Julian day system was introduced by astronomers to provide a single system of dates that could be used when working with different calendars and to unify different historical chronologies .
Almost 2.5 million Julian days have elapsed since the initial epoch .
The Julian day number can be considered a very simple calendar , where its calendar date is just an integer .
A Julian date of 2454115.05486 means that the date and Universal Time is Sunday January 14 , 2007 at 13 : 18 : 59.9 .
JDN 2,400,000 was November 16 , 1858 .
Apart from the choice of the zero point and name , this Julian day and Julian date are not directly related to the Julian calendar , although it is possible to convert any date from one calendar to the other .
0.1 = 2.4 hours or 144 minutes or 8640 seconds 0.01 = 0.24 hours or 14.4 minutes or 864 seconds 0.001 = 0.024 hours or 1.44 minutes or 86.4 seconds 0.0001 = 0.0024 hours or 0.144 minutes or 8.64 seconds 0.00001 = 0.00024 hours or 0.0144 minutes or 0.864 seconds .
JD 2,500,000.0 will occur on August 31 , 2132 at noon UT .
It allows the time between any two dates in history to be computed by simple subtraction .
This is useful for reference , computations , and conversions .
Negative values can be used for dates preceding JD 0 , though they predate all recorded history .
Now , at the Julian day number is .
Anglo-Saxon architecture was a period in the history of architecture in England , and parts of Wales , from the mid-5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066 .
There are , however , many remains of Anglo-Saxon church architecture .
At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin with major Saxon architectural features , with many more claiming to be , although in some cases the Anglo-Saxon part is small and much-altered .
All surviving churches , except one timber church , are built of stone or brick , and in some cases show evidence of re-used Roman work .
Anglo-Saxon secular buildings in Britain were generally simple , constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing .

The Socialists demanded further concessions from Schuschnigg before they were willing to side with him .
The German troops were greeted by cheering Austrians with Hitler salutes , Nazi flags and flowers .
On 9 March 1938 , as a last resort to preserve Austria &apos; s independence , Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite on the issue for 13 March .
After the war , then Allied-occupied Austria was recognized and treated as a separate country . It was not restored to sovereignty until the Austrian State Treaty and Austrian Declaration of Neutrality , both of 1955 , largely due to the rapid development of the Cold War and disputes between the Soviet Union and its former allies over foreign policy .
In the evening , he arrived at Linz and was given an enthusiastic welcome in the city hall .
The Communists announced their unconditional support for the Austrian government .
During the following weeks , Schuschnigg realized that his newly-appointed ministers were working to take over his authority .
Within hours the Austrian Nazis managed to take control of many parts of Vienna , including the ministry of internal Affairs -LRB- controlling the police -RRB- .
As Miklas continued to refuse to appoint a Nazi government , Hitler became furious .
In some remote areas of Austria , people voted to preserve the independence of Austria on 13 March despite the Wehrmachts presence .
Hitler &apos; s car crossed the border in the afternoon at Braunau , his birthplace .
Not as tyrants have we come , but as liberators . &apos; &apos;
Officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received the voting ballot by hand -LRB- in contrast to a secret vote where the voting ballot is inserted into a closed box -RRB- .
Around midnight , after nearly all critical offices and buildings had fallen into Nazi hands in Vienna and the main political party members of the old government had been arrested , Miklas finally conceded to appoint Seyss-Inquart chancellor .
Hitler later commented : `` Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods .
In addition , the German ministry of propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order .
For instance , in the village of Innervillgraten , a majority of 95 % voted for Austria &apos; s independence .
Austria remained part of the Third Reich until the end of World War II , when a preliminary Austrian government declared the Anschluss null und nichtig -LRB- null and void -RRB- on 27 April 1945 .
Meanwhile , Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas refused to appoint Arthur Seyss-Inquart as chancellor and asked other Austrian politicians such as Michael Skubl and Sigismund Schilhawsky to assume the office .
While historians concur that the result was not manipulated , the voting process was neither free nor secret .
On the morning of 12 March , the 8th Army of the German Wehrmacht crossed the Germanâ `` Austrian border .
The plebiscite was held on 10 April and officially recorded a support of 99.73 % of the voters .
I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people , but when I crossed the former frontier -LRB- into Austria -RRB- there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced .
Austria became the province of Ostmark , and Seyss-Inquart was appointed governor .
Hitler declared that the referendum would be subject to major fraud and that Germany would not accept it .
I can only say : even in death they can not stop lying .
The Anschluss was given immediate effect by legislative act on 13 March , subject to ratification by a plebiscite .
Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March , demanding that he hand over all power to the Austrian National Socialists or face an invasion .
Hitler &apos; s travel through Austria became a triumphal tour that climaxed in Vienna , on 2 April 1938 , when around 200,000 Austrians gathered on the Heldenplatz -LRB- Square of Heroes -RRB- to hear Hitler proclaim the Austrian Anschluss .
For the first time since 12 February 1934 -LRB- the time of the Austrian Civil War -RRB- , Socialists and Communists could legally appear in public again .
At about 10 pm , well after Hitler had signed and issued the order for the invasion , GÃ ring and Hitler gave up on waiting and published a forged telegram containing a request by the Austrian Government for German troops .
Schuschnigg immediately responded publicly that reports of riots were false .
On 31 October 2001 , Ole von Beust became First Mayor of Hamburg .
He has been a member of the ruling council of the Hamburg Land CDU since 1992 , and of the national ruling council of the CDU party since 1998 .
Beust had earlier dismissed Walter Wellinghausen , senator of the interior and Schill &apos; s most important official , without consulting Schill beforehand .
Carl-Friedrich Arp Ole Freiherr von Beust , generally called Ole von Beust , born April 13 , 1955 , in Hamburg , Germany , was First Mayor of the city-state -LRB- Freie und Hansestadt -RRB- of Hamburg from 31 October 2001 to 25 August 2010 , serving as President of the Bundesrat from 1 November 2007 on for one year .
In a later interview , Beust &apos; s father confirmed that his son is indeed homosexual .
Through his father he is a descendant of Saxon and Austrian statesman Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust .
However , since the CDU lost its absolute majority , it formed a coalition government with the Greens .
This was due to public allegations of misconduct on Wellinghausen &apos; s part .
He stated `` I have nothing against homosexuals &apos; &apos; .
In the -LRB- preassigned -RRB- press conference Schill held minutes after he had heard of his own dismissal , he spoke vaguely of `` homosexual relationships &apos; &apos; , a `` flat in an infamous hustler district &apos; &apos; and `` certain things happened that let one infer the occurrence of love acts &apos; &apos; between Beust and Roger Kusch , who Beust had appointed minister -LRB- in German city-states `` senator &apos; &apos; -RRB- of justice .
Schill however later affirmed Beust &apos; s version of the story , except for the accusations of blackmail , saying that he warned Beust to stay clear of nepotism , and that this had nothing to do with Beust &apos; s sexual orientation .
In 1971 von Beust became member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union -LRB- CDU -RRB- .
In a private conversation , Schill then demanded that Beust take back the dismissal , allegedly using personal threats .
In 1973 , after finishing high school , he worked for the CDU group in Hamburg &apos; s city-state parliament -LRB- `` BÃ 1 \ / 4 rgerschaft &apos; &apos; -RRB- , a position he held until he started to study law in 1975 at the University of Hamburg .
This was the first time since 1993 the city-state has had only a single ruling party .
On 19 August 2003 , Beust dismissed his vice-mayor Ronald Schill , causing a scandal .
On July 18 , 2010 Ole von Beust declared his resignation effective August 25 .
The Hamburg elections of February 29 , 2004 , ended with an unprecedented landslide victory for Ole von Beust and the CDU , with the party achieving absolute majority in the city-state &apos; s parliament .
His unprepared statement to the press quickly earned Schill an homophobic reputation .
In 1983 he successfully completed his studies and became an independent lawyer .
Thus , the CDU continued to be the strongest party in Hamburg .
`` This is all -- absolutely all &apos; &apos; , according to Beust .
A popular radio-station broadcast a song calling him `` Mega-Proll &apos; &apos; -LRB- mega redneck -RRB- and gay and lesbian associations protested vocally .
Beust himself considers his sexual orientation a private matter ; when asked directly he usually ironically refers the interviewer to his father .
The CDU gained 47.2 percent of the vote , a full 21-point increase from the previous election in September 2001 .
In the Hamburg elections of February 24 , 2008 , the CDU gained 42.6 percent of the vote .
From 1977 until 1983 he was Hamburg president of the youth organization of his party .
He said he had no sexual relationship with Kusch , that they merely knew each other for 25 years and were good friends , and that Beust was Kusch &apos; s landlord .
Beust in turn stated that Schill threatened to make his alleged liaison with Kusch public under the premise that Beust intermingled public and private affairs .
Beust then decided to dismiss Schill as well .
Since 1978 Beust has been a member of the Hamburg city-state &apos; s parliament .
He was a finalist for the 2010 World Mayor prize .
He is the son of Achim Helge Freiherr von Beust and Hanna , nÃ e Wolff , who was considered half Jewish in Nazi Germany .
He was succeeded as mayor by Christoph Ahlhaus .

Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word .
The processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer , then add the 8 higher-order bits , requiring two instructions to complete a single operation .
Bit-level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor word size . From the advent of very-large-scale integration -LRB- VLSI -RRB- computer chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986 , advancements in computer architecture were done by increasing bit-level parallelism
-LRB- For example , consider a case where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers .
This trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32-bit processors , which has been a standard in general purpose computing for two decades . Only recently , with the advent of x86-64 architectures , have 64-bit processors become commonplace .
Historically , 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit , then 16-bit , then 32-bit microprocessors .

Ballmer joined Microsoft on June 11 , 1980 , and became Microsoft &apos; s 30th employee , the first business manager hired by Gates . Ballmer loved working at Microsoft .
He has referred to the free software Linux kernel as a &apos; &apos; -LRB- â -RRB- cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches . &apos; &apos;
The same year , Ballmer replaced Microsoft &apos; s employee stock options program .
Referring to Google CEO Eric Schmidt -LRB- who previously worked for competitors Sun and Novell -RRB- , Ballmer vowed to `` kill Google &apos; &apos; in an expletive-laden tirade then resumed trying to persuade Lucovsky to stay at Microsoft .
The Wall Street Journal has reported that there was tension surrounding the 2000 transition of authority from Bill Gates to Ballmer .
For example , Ballmer &apos; s flamboyant stage appearances at Microsoft events are widely circulated on the Internet as viral videos .
After the exchange , Ballmer seemed `` remorseful &apos; &apos; , the person said .
Another video , captured at a developers &apos; conference , features Steve Ballmer chanting the word `` developers &apos; &apos; .
Things became so bitter that , on one occasion , Gates stormed out of a meeting in a huff after a shouting match in which Ballmer jumped to the defense of several colleagues , according to an individual present at the time .
Ballmer has described characterizations of the incident as a `` gross exaggeration of what actually took place &apos; &apos; .
He has headed several divisions within Microsoft including `` Operating Systems Development &apos; &apos; , `` Operations &apos; &apos; , and `` Sales and Support . &apos; &apos;
In 2005 , Mark Lucovsky alleged in a sworn statement to a Washington state court that Ballmer became enraged upon hearing that Lucovsky was about to leave Microsoft for Google , picked up his chair , and threw it across his office .
As CEO Ballmer handled company finances , however Gates still retained control of the `` technological vision &apos; &apos; .
In 2003 , Ballmer sold 8.3 % of his shareholdings , leaving him with a 4 % stake in the company .
`` Use him , yes , need him , no . &apos; &apos;
In 2009 , and for the first time ever , he made the opening keynote at CES , since Bill Gates left Microsoft as full-time chairman .
That &apos; s the principle , &apos; &apos; Ballmer said .
On March 6 , 2008 , Seattle &apos; s Mayor announced that a local ownership group involving Ballmer made a `` game changing &apos; &apos; commitment to invest $ 150 million in cash toward a $ 300 million renovation of Key Arena and were ready to purchase the Seattle SuperSonics in order to keep them in the City of Seattle .
Ballmer used the notion of `` viral &apos; &apos; licensing terms to express his concern over the fact that the GNU General Public License -LRB- GPL -RRB- employed by such software requires that all derivative software be under the GPL or a compatible license .
Once Gates leaves , `` I &apos; m not going to need him for anything .
Ballmer was the second person after Roberto Goizueta to become a billionaire in U.S. dollars based on stock options received as an employee of a corporation in which he was neither a founder nor a relative of a founder .

He was initially offered a salary of $ 50,000 as well as a percentage of ownership of the company .

The SS Einsatzgruppen death squads , formed by his deputy , Heydrich , murdered many civilian non-combatants , mostly Jews , in the countries occupied by Germany during World War II .

Moreover , legal jurisdiction over the SS and its members was taken away from the civilian courts and given to courts run by the SS itself .
Himmler , the leader of the SS , was a chief architect of the Final Solution .
In contrast to the black-uniformed Allgemeine SS -LRB- the political wing of the SS -RRB- , the Waffen-SS -LRB- the military wing -RRB- evolved into a second German army aside the Wehrmacht -LRB- the regular national armed forces -RRB- and operating in tandem with them ; especially with the Heer -LRB- German Army -RRB- .

Since the heat pump or refrigerator uses a certain amount of work to move the refrigerant , the amount of energy deposited on the hot side is greater than taken from the cold side . One common type of heat pump works by exploiting the physical properties of an evaporating and condensing fluid known as a refrigerant .
A heat pump is a machine or device that moves heat from one location -LRB- the ` source &apos; -RRB- at a lower temperature to another location -LRB- the ` sink &apos; or ` heat sink &apos; -RRB- at a higher temperature using mechanical work or a high-temperature heat source . A heat pump can be used to provide heating or cooling .

The conspirators were betrayed by a member of the group and Hidalgo turned to his parishioners in the town of Dolores .
Iturbide , a native of Valladolid , had gained renown for the zeal with which he persecuted Hidalgo &apos; s and Morelos &apos; s rebels during the early independence struggle .
Under his leadership the cities of Oaxaca and Acapulco were occupied .
Hidalgo and his remaining soldiers were captured in the state of Coahuila at the Wells of BajÃ n -LRB- Norias de BajÃ n -RRB- . He faced court trial of the Inquisition on 30 July 1811 .
Originally Hidalgo worked closely with co-conspirator Ignacio de Allende , a noble and member of the Basque society living in San Miguel . Hidalgo originally supported naming Allende head of the revolutionary military , but the two men quickly became rivals .
On August 24 , 1821 , representatives of the Spanish crown and Iturbide signed the Treaty of CÃ rdoba , which recognized Mexican independence under the terms of the Plan of Iguala .
On the night of the May 18 , 1822 , a mass demonstration led by the Regiment of Celaya , which Iturbide had commanded during the war , marched through the streets and demanded that their commander-in-chief accept the throne .
When the rebels &apos; victory became certain , the viceroy resigned .
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla , was a Mexican priest and member of a group of educated Criollos in QuerÃ taro who met in tertulias -LRB- salons -RRB- and who in 1810 arrived at the conclusion that a revolt against the colonial government was needed because of the events of the Peninsular War .
In what was supposed to be the final government campaign against the insurgents , in December 1820 , Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent a force led by a royalist criollo officer , Colonel AgustÃ n de Iturbide , to defeat Guerrero &apos; s army in Oaxaca .
In January 1811 , Spanish forces fought the Battle of the Bridge of CalderÃ n and defeated the insurgent army , forcing the rebels to flee towards the United States-Mexican border , where they hoped to escape .
On September 27 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City and the following day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire , as New Spain was to be henceforth called .
Iturbide &apos; s army was joined by rebel forces from all over Mexico .
The plan was so broadly based that it pleased both patriots and loyalists .
The following day , the congress declared Iturbide emperor of Mexico .
When news of the liberal charter reached Mexico , Iturbide saw in it both a threat to the status quo and an opportunity for the criollos to gain control of Mexico .
The struggle for Mexican independence dates back to the decades after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , when MartÃ n CortÃ s -LRB- son of HernÃ n CortÃ s and La Malinche -RRB- led a revolt against the Spanish colonial government in order to eliminate privileges for the conquistadors .

The Mexican War of Independence -LRB- 1810 -- 1821 -RRB- was an armed conflict between the people of Mexico and the Spanish colonial authorities which started on 16 September 1810 .
The movement , which became known as the Mexican War of Independence , was led by Mexican-born Spaniards , Mestizos and Amerindians who sought independence from Spain .
The coup leaders , who had been assembled as an expeditionary force to suppress the American independence movements , compelled a reluctant Ferdinand to reinstate the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 .
In 1818 , the Congress of Chilpancingo was convened and on 6 November of that year , the Congress signed the first official document of independence , known as the `` Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America &apos; &apos; .
Following the death of Father Hidalgo , the leadership of the revolutionary army was assumed by JosÃ MarÃ a Morelos .
After convincing his troops to accept the principles , which were promulgated on February 24 , 1821 , as the Plan of Iguala , Iturbide persuaded Guerrero to join his forces in support of the new conservative manifestation of the independence movement .
It was followed by a long period of war at the Siege of Cuautla .
The revolutionary army decided to strike for independence and marched on to Guanajuato , a major colonial mining center governed by Spaniards and criollos .
A new army , the Army of the Three Guarantees , was then placed under Iturbide &apos; s command to enforce the Plan of Iguala .
On October 30 , Miguel Hidalgo &apos; s army encountered Spanish resistance at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces , fought them and achieved victory .
Around 6 : 00 am of September 16 , 1810 he declared independence from the Spanish crown , and war against the government in what was known as the Grito de Dolores .

In practice however due to Wikipedia &apos; s open nature of being the ` The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit &apos; , articles are and will be created which do not follow Wikipedia &apos; s policies and guidelines fully but have the potential to do so .
It is frequently a better option to do one or more of the following :
This can cause problems , as frequently editors simply do not have time to fix articles within such a short time period .
Articles are frequently nominated for deletion because of their current state , not their potential as an encyclopedic entry .
These nominations can often result in de facto time limits of about seven days -LRB- changed from five in April 2009 -RRB- for an article to either improve , or be deleted and sometimes merged .
In cases where an article could have potential in the future but does not now , it should be merged or redirected appropriately if possible , so it can be easily re-created when potential is gained .
If an article is proposed for deletion and you think the article has potential to address the concerns raised , such as notability , then you can simply remove the template from the article .
Merging an article on a topic with narrow scope into an article with a larger scope can frequently be a good solution to issues of a topic not being notable or verifiable enough for its own Wikipedia article entry .
Deletion of a article can be one step backwards in creating an encyclopedic entry for a notable topic .
If an article is deleted by the proposed deletion process , it is possible to make a request to a administrator to undelete it , based on its potential for improvement and expansion .
There are several simple methods that can be used to help determine if an article has potential , even if it is relatively short .
Note however that an article should have immediate potential , as Wikipedia is not a crystal ball .
This will allow for editors in the long-term to improve the article to address all concerns .
It can also help to explain your aims for the article and its potential notability .
It suggests that if an article does not demonstrate notability , editors should make a good faith search for sources before deletion or merging .
These options help navigation and allow the encyclopedia to flow , while also encouraging long-term article expansion .
Frequently the concept can be applied when becoming involved with a variety of Wikipedia processes .
It is frequently a better option to do one or more of the following :
Time should be given for input from multiple editors to allow improvements to be made .
Wikipedia is constantly changing and evolving â `` omnia mutantur â `` and it is frequently better to think of the potential of an article as well as how it looks at present .
If you have just created an article and it is nominated for speedy deletion , it can be sensible to add the tag and then to state on the article &apos; s talk page that you are still working on the article .
An article could have potential if :
Often adding context to the article will help in the short-term to establish the potential of an encyclopedic entry on a topic .
Many articles are created on Wikipedia every day , most of which are a good faith effort by contributors to improve the encyclopedia .
If you are against a merge because you think the article &apos; s topic is notable enough for its own entry , it is sensible to explain why on the article &apos; s talk page .
However , merging an article which has potential to be successful as a standalone article in the long-run can constrain encyclopedia expansion , cause articles to specialise in one subject area , and possibly result in articles getting too long .
While encouraging planning and preparation when creating articles is desirable , contributors , particularly users new to Wikipedia , can not be expected to build an article perfectly at first attempt .
The concept of potential is recognized in the Notability guideline under # Articles not satisfying the notability guidelines .
Keeping articles with potential encourages editors , especially unregistered users , to be bold and improve the article to allow it to evolve over time .
It is polite to state -LRB- often on the article &apos; s talk page -RRB- why you think the article should be kept ; such as citing sources -LRB- often those on the internet -RRB- that the article can use giving the topic notability and making deletion unnecessary .
Having to re-create an article from scratch often takes a long time and can result in a long-term loss of encyclopedic information from Wikipedia .
Preferably the first revision of all new articles would be beefed up enough so the suitability of an article for inclusion in the encyclopedia could be assessed without needing to look at potential .
In most cases deletion of an article should be a last resort in the event that the article &apos; s topic is not notable and has no potential for its own encyclopedic entry on Wikipedia .
When discussing mergers it is also wise to think of the long-term , such as the possibility of an article getting too long .
Sometimes it will be suggested that an article be merged with another article .
It can also be helpful to quickly remove content of an article which is causing problems , and to add templates to the article as necessary .
In these cases it is helpful to alert the discussion that the article has potential to be made into a successful encyclopedic entry , and that more time is needed to improve the article .
Potential , not just current state relates to the debate on whether articles in the mainspace should be deleted , merged , or kept based on their current potential to be an encyclopedic entry , or as they are now .

This template allows the creation of subgroups that can be assigned to a list item within .
; oddstyle ; evenstyle : CSS styles to apply to the odd-numbered list items -LRB- list1 , list3 , etc -RRB- or even-numbered list items -LRB- list2 , list4 , etc -RRB- , respectively .
; liststyle : CSS styles to apply to all lists .
Format is inline .

Setting to disables automatic row striping .
The background color defaults to , but can be changed via the groupstyle parameter -LRB- see below -RRB- .
Typically used to set background color in order to achieve an alternating background color between odd and even-numbered lists .
At least one list parameter is required ; each additional list is displayed in a separate row of the table .
Normally , even rows get a light gray background for striping ; when this parameter is used , the odd rows receive the gray striping instead of the even rows .
The background color of the list items -LRB- and the entire table -RRB- defaults to , therefore it displays the same background color used in the parent navigation box .
The following is an example of Navbox subgroup used within a Navbox template .
; bodystyle : Specifies CSS styles to apply to the template body .
Setting to or sets all rows to have that striping color .
Overridden by the oddstyle and evenstyle parameters -LRB- if specified -RRB- below .

Each listn may be preceded by a corresponding groupn parameter , if provided -LRB- see below -RRB- .
If multiple templates are used inside of a parent , it generally looks better if the width of the groups matches up .
If you also use the or parameters , then you will most likely also need to set their width manually using the and parameters .
; grouppadding : CSS style to specify group padding .
It is recommended to leave this parameter alone and use the default padding .
This option overrides any styles that are applied to the entire table .
NOTE : Due to system limitations , do not use a semi-colon to close this command .
This template is designed to be used with or other navigational templates that allow creating lists of links with groups headers or titles .

For example , place the following code in each to adjust the widths :
This example implements horizontal group headings by assigning the headings to and and the links to and -RRB- , then using and to set the background color of the headings .
An alternative way is to set the parameters to contain the desired width , and the parameters to have width : auto -LRB- due to HTML \ / CSS reasons -RRB- .

Arnold had an Indian messenger sent into the camp of British Brigadier General Barry St. Leger with news that the approaching force was much larger and closer than it actually was ; this convinced St. Leger &apos; s Indian support to abandon him , forcing him to give up the effort .
In the winter of 1782 , Arnold moved to London with his second wife , Margaret `` Peggy &apos; &apos; Shippen Arnold .
He then distinguished himself in both Battles of Saratoga , even though General Gates , following a series of escalating disagreements and disputes that culminated in a shouting match , removed him from field command after the first battle .
Fictional invocations of Arnold &apos; s name also carried strongly negative overtones .
His doctors diagnosed him as having dropsy , and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition .
In the Battle of Ridgefield , he led a small contingent of militia attempting to stop or slow the British return to the coast , and was again wounded in his left leg .
In London he aligned himself with the Tories , advising Germain and King George III to renew the fight against the Americans .
This suggestion Clinton refused ; after a military tribunal , AndrÃ was hanged at Tappan , New York on October 2 .
AndrÃ then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold .
Benedict was born the second of six children to Benedict Arnold III -LRB- 1683 â `` 1761 -RRB- and Hannah Waterman King in Norwich , Connecticut , on January 14 , 1741 .

Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant delivering AndrÃ into Arnold &apos; s custody , but then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of AndrÃ &apos; s arrest .
-LRB- Arnold did not know that this proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources . -RRB-
On June 16 , Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business , and sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel .
Arnold initially took no part in any public demonstrations but , like many merchants , continued to trade as if the Stamp Act did not exist , in effect becoming a smuggler in defiance of the act .
However , the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes , since his father took up drinking .
He helped organize militia forces on British-held islands , receiving praise from the landowners for his efforts on their behalf .
Arnold proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety an action to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York , which he knew was poorly defended .
Arnold learned of AndrÃ &apos; s capture the following morning , September 24 , when he received Jameson &apos; s message that AndrÃ was in his custody and that the papers AndrÃ was carrying had been sent to General Washington .
Following the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord the following month , his company marched northeast to assist in the siege of Boston that followed .
On the grounds of the United States Military Academy at West Point there are plaques commemorating all of the generals that served in the Revolution .
Rather than amputating his shattered left leg , he had it crudely set , leaving it 2 i shorter than the right .

On May 9 , Franklin introduced Stansbury to Major AndrÃ , who had just been named the British spy chief .
Social historian Brian Carso notes that as the 19th century progressed , the story of Arnold &apos; s betrayal took on near-mythic proportions as a part of the national creation story , and was again invoked as sectional conflicts leading up the American Civil War increased .
Legend has it that when he was on his deathbed he said , `` Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles .
Harper &apos; s Weekly published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as `` a few men directing this colossal treason , by whose side Benedict Arnold shines white as a saint . &apos; &apos;
Arnold worked over the next few months to publicize this fact ; however , in early April , just one week after Washington congratulated Arnold on the May 19 birth of his son , Edward Shippen Arnold , Washington published a formal rebuke of Arnold &apos; s behavior .
He wrote he was `` very much shocked &apos; &apos; and wondered `` good God , are the Americans all asleep and tamely giving up their liberties , or are they all turned philosophers , that they do n &apos;t take immediate vengeance on such miscreants &apos; &apos; .
In 1785 Arnold and his son Richard moved to Saint John , New Brunswick , where they speculated in land , and established a business doing trade with the West Indies .
But one notable treatment , depicting Arnold very much in a positive light , is Kenneth Roberts &apos; Arundel novels , which cover many of the campaigns in which he participated :
At the same time , he tried to drain West Point &apos; s supplies , so that a siege would be more likely to succeed .
Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there .
Heron , in a comic twist , went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter , and offered his own services to the British as a spy .
At first , he asked for indemnification of his losses and Â # 10,000 , an amount the Continental Congress had given Charles Lee for his services in the Continental Army .
Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges , writing to Washington in May 1779 , `` Having become a cripple in the service of my country , I little expected to meet -LRB- such -RRB- ungrateful returns &apos; &apos; .
One colonel wrote to Clinton of Arnold , `` there are many officers who must wish some other general in command &apos; &apos; .
When presented with evidence of Arnold &apos; s betrayal , it is reported that Washington was calm .
He had established decent relationships with George Washington , commander of the army , as well as Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates , both of whom had command of the army &apos; s Northern Department during 1775 and 1776 .
Through his maternal grandmother , Arnold was a descendant of John Lothropp , an ancestor of at least four U.S. presidents .
In February of 1777 , he learned that he had been passed over for promotion to major general by Congress .
Once he established himself at West Point , Arnold began systematically weakening its defenses and military strength .
His conflicting legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor .
Arnold also faced financial ruin , falling Â # 16,000 in debt , with creditors spreading rumors of his insolvency to the point where he took legal action against them .
Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia , and was a prominent figure on the social scene .
With the outbreak of the French Revolution Arnold outfitted a privateer , while continuing to do business in the West Indies , even though the hostilities increased the risk .
Meanwhile , AndrÃ convinced the unsuspecting commanding officer to whom he was delivered , Colonel John Jameson , to send him back to Arnold at West Point .
While this is the case , no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company . &apos; &apos;
When he was ten , Arnold was enrolled in a private school in nearby Canterbury , with the expectation that he would eventually attend Yale .
From the ship Arnold wrote a letter to Washington , requesting that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia , a request Washington granted .
General Washington assigned Arnold to the defense of Rhode Island following the British seizure of Newport in December 1776 , where the militia were too poorly equipped to even consider an attack on the British .
Their first son , Benedict VI , was born the following year , and was followed by brothers Richard in 1769 , and Henry in 1772 .
Benedict Arnold V -LRB- â `` June 14 , 1801 -RRB- was a general during the American Revolutionary War .
Arnold then went to Cambridge , Massachusetts , and suggested to George Washington a second expedition to attack Quebec City via a wilderness route through present-day Maine .
He also peppered Washington with complaints about the lack of supplies , writing , `` Everything is wanting &apos; &apos; .
The court martial to consider the charges against Arnold began meeting on June 1 , 1779 , but was delayed until December 1779 by General Clinton &apos; s capture of Stony Point , New York , throwing the army into a flurry of activity to react .
Upon learning of AndrÃ &apos; s capture , Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture , narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington , who had been alerted to the plot .
He was named after his great-grandfather Benedict Arnold , an early governor of the Colony of Rhode Island , and his brother Benedict IV , who died in infancy .
In the letter to Washington requesting safe passage for Peggy , he wrote that `` Love to my country actuates my present conduct , however it may appear inconsistent to the world , who very seldom judge right of any man &apos; s actions . &apos; &apos;
Born in Connecticut , Arnold was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775 .
However , Arnold interpreted the manner in which they did so as an act of sympathy for his wounds , and not an apology or recognition that they were righting a wrong .
In January 1801 Arnold &apos; s health began to decline .
In 1787 , he entered into mercantile business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John , New Brunswick , but returned to London to settle permanently in 1791 , where he died ten years later .
Following the most serious , a slander suit he won against a former business partner , townspeople burned him in effigy in front of his house as Peggy and the children watched .
The connection between Arnold and treason continued into the 20th and 21st centuries .
Burgoyne surrendered ten days after the second battle , on October 17 , 1777 .
Washington refused his offer to resign , and wrote to members of Congress in an attempt to correct this , noting that `` two or three other very good officers &apos; &apos; might be lost if they persisted in making politically-motivated promotions .
On an episode of The Brady Bunch , Everyone Ca n &apos;t Be George Washington , after Peter is assigned the role of Arnold in the school play , everyone hates him .
By early July he was back in Philadelphia , where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on July 7 , which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a `` drawing of the works ... by which you might take -LRB- West Point -RRB- without loss &apos; &apos; .
During the fighting in the second battle , Arnold , operating against Gates &apos; orders , took to the battlefield and led attacks on the British defenses .
He was imprisoned by French authorities on Guadeloupe amid accusations of spying for the British , and narrowly eluded hanging by escaping to the blockading British fleet after bribing his guards .
Rev. Samuel Spring , his chaplain , carried him to the makeshift hospital at the Hotel Dieu .
He then took the letter back to Connecticut , where , suspicious of Arnold &apos; s actions , he delivered it to the head of the Connecticut militia .
To Arnold &apos; s detriment the anti-war Whigs had gotten the upper hand in Parliament , and Germain was forced to resign , with the government of Lord North falling not long after .
General Clinton and Major AndrÃ , who returned victorious from the Siege of Charleston on June 18 , were immediately caught up in this news .
On his return to New York in June , Arnold made a variety of proposals for continuing to attack essentially economic targets in order to force the Americans to end the war .
Arnold himself said it would have been better had it been in the chest instead of the leg .
The British gave Arnold a brigadier general &apos; s commission with an annual income of several hundred pounds , but only paid him Â # 6,315 plus an annual pension of Â # 360 because his plot failed .
The demonization of Arnold began immediately after his betrayal became public .
In spite of the fact that a number of members of the panel of judges were men ill-disposed to Arnold over actions and disputes earlier in the war , Arnold was cleared of all but two minor charges on January 26 , 1780 .
He returned to the army at Valley Forge in May 1778 to the applause of men who had served under him at Saratoga .
His subordinates , some of whom were long-time associates , grumbled about unnecessary distribution of supplies , and eventually concluded that Arnold was selling some of the supplies on the black market for personal gain .
Arnold spent several months recovering from his injuries .
On August 15 he received a coded letter from AndrÃ with Clinton &apos; s final offer : Â # 20,000 , and no indemnification for his losses .
In the House of Commons , Edmund Burke expressed the hope that the government would not put Arnold `` at the head of a part of a British army &apos; &apos; lest `` the sentiments of true honor , which every British officer -LRB- holds -RRB- dearer than life , should be afflicted . &apos; &apos;
Arnold purchased large tracts of land in the Maugerville area , and acquired city lots in Saint John and Fredericton .
Washington , in assigning Arnold to the command at West Point , also gave him authority over the entire American-controlled Hudson River , from Albany down to the British lines outside New York City .
While a general on the American side he obtained command of the fort at West Point , New York , and plotted to surrender it to the British forces .
The family moved to Saint John in 1787 , where Arnold created an uproar with a series of bad business deals and petty lawsuits .
The household , even while she lived , was dominated by Arnold &apos; s sister Hannah .
His reputation also came under criticism in the British press , especially when compared to that of Major AndrÃ , who was celebrated for his patriotism .
In turning him down for an East India Company posting , George Johnstone wrote , `` Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct , the generality do not think so .
He left a small estate , reduced in size by his debts , which Peggy undertook to clear .
Early in April , Philip Schuyler had approached Arnold with the possibility of giving him the command at West Point .
This initial letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence Arnold might provide , and included instructions for how to communicate in the future .
However , not all depictions of Arnold were strongly negative .
Congress investigated his accounts , and found that he owed it money after he had spent much of his own money on the war effort .
Arnold was hardworking and successful , and was able to rapidly expand his business .
Arnold continued on to Philadelphia , where he met with members of Congress about his rank .
The fourth niche is empty .
This was the beginning of a secret correspondence between Arnold and AndrÃ , sometimes using his wife Peggy as a willing intermediary , that culminated over a year later with Arnold &apos; s change of sides .
Arnold &apos; s father was a successful businessman , and the family moved in the upper levels of Norwich society .
There he participated in the first recorded Oath of Allegiance along with many other soldiers , as a sign of loyalty to the United States .
Troops were liberally distributed within Arnold &apos; s command area -LRB- but only minimally at West Point itself -RRB- , or furnished to Washington on request .
George Canning Hill , who authored a series of moralistic biographies in the mid-19th century , began his 1865 biography of Arnold `` Benedict , the Traitor , was born ... &apos; &apos; .
The Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 severely curtailed mercantile trade in the colonies .
However , Major Benjamin Tallmadge , a member of Washington &apos; s secret service , insisted Jameson order the prisoner intercepted and brought back .
Because of the way he changed sides , his name quickly became a byword in the United States for treason or betrayal .
Joined by Richard Montgomery &apos; s small army , he participated in the December 31 assault on Quebec City in which Montgomery was killed and Arnold &apos; s leg was shattered .
Brown was particularly vicious , publishing a handbill that claimed of Arnold , `` Money is this man &apos; s God , and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country &apos; &apos; .
The French had besieged Fort William Henry , and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory .
Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramors across the battle lines , in spite of military bans on communication with the enemy .
Using the profits from the sale of his homestead they bought three trading ships and established a lucrative West Indies trade .
Arnold was convicted of a disorderly conduct charge and fined the relatively small amount of 50 shillings ; publicity of the case and widespread sympathy for his view probably contributed to the light sentence .
On Saturday , September 23 , AndrÃ was captured , near Tarrytown , by three Westchester patriots named John Paulding , Isaac Van Wart and David Williams ; the papers exposing the plot to capture West Point were found and sent to Washington , and Arnold &apos; s treachery came to light after Washington examined them .
His apprenticeship with the Lathrops lasted seven years .
Arnold began the war as a captain in Connecticut &apos; s militia , a position to which he was elected in March 1775 .
Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury , a Philadelphia merchant .
He had also had disagreements with John Brown and James Easton , two lower-level officers with political connections that resulted in ongoing suggestions of improprieties on his part .
During this time he brought his sister Hannah to New Haven and established her in his apothecary to manage the business in his absence .
He died after four days of delirium , on June 14 , 1801 , at the age of 60 .
Delivery of his first ship , the Lord Sheffield , was accompanied by accusations from the builder that Arnold had cheated him ; Arnold claimed that he had merely deducted the contractually agreed amount when the ship was delivered late .
In December 1780 , under orders from Clinton , Arnold led a force of 1,600 troops into Virginia , where he captured Richmond by surprise and then went on a rampage through Virginia , destroying supply houses , foundries , and mills .
When word of the surrender reached New York , Arnold renewed the request , which Clinton then granted .
Arnold was in the West Indies when the Boston Massacre took place on March 5 , 1770 .
He also began to insist on a face-to-face meeting , and suggested to Arnold that he pursue another high-level command .
These schemes were sometimes frustrated by powerful local politicians , who eventually amassed enough evidence to publicly air charges .
Some theatrical treatments of the 19th century explored his duplicity , seeking to understand rather than demonize it .
General Clinton , who was pursuing a campaign to gain control of the Hudson River Valley , was interested in plans and information on the defenses of West Point and other defenses on the Hudson River .
His Judas-role in popular imagination is so fixed though that even an iconoclastic novel sequence like Gore Vidal &apos; s Narratives of Empire does not question it .
After a difficult passage in which 300 men turned back and another 200 died en route , Arnold arrived before Quebec City in November .
A moralistic children &apos; s tale entitled `` The Cruel Boy &apos; &apos; was widely circulated in the 19th century .
Arnold &apos; s scheme was exposed when American forces captured British Major John AndrÃ carrying papers that revealed the plot .
The pursuing American army included the Marquis de Lafayette , who was under orders from Washington to summarily hang Arnold if he was captured .
On August 25 , Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton &apos; s agreement to the terms .
A line by the comically insincere character Sir in the 1965 Broadway musical The Roar of the Greasepaint â `` The Smell of the Crowd , who often declares his integrity with references to entirely untrustworthy individuals which his foil Cocky does not understand , declares , `` God knows I &apos; m not perfect , Cocky , but by the unswerving loyalties of Benedict Arnold , I do believe in forgiving a friend . &apos; &apos;
In July 1792 he fought a bloodless duel with the Earl of Lauderdale after the Earl impugned his honor in the House of Lords .
While there he disentangled himself from a lawsuit over an unpaid debt that Peggy had been fighting while he was away , paying Â # 900 to settle a Â # 12,000 loan he had taken while living in Philadelphia .
In 1763 he repaid money borrowed from the Lathrops , repurchased the family homestead that his father had sold when deeply in debt , and re-sold it a year later for a substantial profit .
Eventually , a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb &apos; s Ferry .
However , an acrimonious dispute with Moses Hazen , commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment , boiled over into a court martial of Hazen at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776 .
Amid negotiations over that issue , Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11 , the same day word arrived in Philadelphia that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British .
By the time he was fourteen , there was no money for private education .
May God forgive me for ever having put on another , &apos; &apos; but this may be apocryphal .
In 1764 he formed a partnership with Adam Babcock , another young New Haven merchant .
He presided over the rear of the Continental Army during its retreat from Saint-Jean , where he was reported by James Wilkinson to be the last person to leave before the British arrived .
Letters would be passed through the women &apos; s circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of , but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions written in both code and invisible ink that were to be passed on to AndrÃ , using Stansbury as the courier .
Donated by Civil War General John Watts DePeyster , the inscription on the Boot Monument reads : `` In memory of the most brilliant soldier of the Continental army , who was desperately wounded on this spot , winning for his countrymen the decisive battle of the American Revolution , and for himself the rank of Major General . &apos; &apos;
Cornwallis ignored advice proffered by Arnold to locate a permanent base away from the coast that might have averted his later surrender at Yorktown .
The victory monument at Saratoga has four niches , three of which are occupied by statues of Generals Gates , Schuyler , and Morgan .
On December 8 , 1781 , Arnold and his family left New York for England .
Discussions between Schuyler and Washington on the subject had not borne fruit by early June .
During the summer of 1778 Arnold met Peggy Shippen , the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen , a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city .
In July 1780 , he sought and obtained command of West Point in order to surrender it to the British .
He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain .
He was on his way home from Ticonderoga when he learned that his wife died earlier in June .
The faculty club at the University of New Brunswick , Fredericton , has a Benedict Arnold Room , in which framed original letters written by Arnold hang on the walls .
Peggy and Arnold married on April 8 , 1779 .
His father was arrested on several occasions for public drunkenness , was refused communion by his church , and eventually died in 1761 .
On August 3 , 1780 , Arnold obtained command of West Point .
Arnold and AndrÃ finally met on September 21 at Joshua Hett Smith &apos; s house .
After the British withdrew from Philadelphia in June 1778 Washington appointed Arnold military commander of the city .
Biblical themes were often invoked ; Benjamin Franklin wrote that `` Judas sold only one man , Arnold three millions &apos; &apos; , and Alexander Scammel described Arnold &apos; s actions as `` black as hell &apos; &apos; .
Arnold benefited from his relationship with Mansfield , who became a partner in his business and used his position as sheriff to shield Arnold from creditors .
Gout , which he had suffered since 1775 , attacked his unwounded leg to the point where he was unable to go to sea ; the other ached constantly , and he walked only with a cane .
On the morning of September 22 , James Livingston , the colonel in charge of the outpost at Verplanck &apos; s Point , fired on HMS Vulture , the ship that was intended to carry AndrÃ back to New York .
The captain was wounded after the first exchange of gunfire , and apologized after Arnold threatened to aim to kill on the second .
One particularly harsh critic said that he was a `` mean mercenary , who , having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder , quits it when convicted of that charge . &apos; &apos;
In response to Arnold &apos; s valor at Saratoga , Congress restored his command seniority .
Frustrated and bitter , Arnold decided to change sides in 1779 , and opened secret negotiations with the British .
On August 13 Schuyler dispatched him with a force of 900 to relieve the siege of Fort Stanwix , where he succeeded in the use of a ruse to lift the siege .
He was well received by King George III and the Tories but frowned upon by the Whigs .
Shortly after Washington &apos; s rebuke , a Congressional inquiry into his expenditures concluded that Arnold had failed to fully account for his expenditures incurred during the Quebec invasion , and that he owed the Congress some Â # 1,000 , largely because he was unable to document them .
Arnold was buried at St. Mary &apos; s Church , Battersea in London , England .
These letters were delivered not by Stansbury but by Samuel Wallis , another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British .
Arnold then returned to the Hudson , where General Gates had taken over command of the American army , which had by then retreated to a camp south of Stillwater .
On February 22 , 1767 , he married Margaret Mansfield , daughter of Samuel Mansfield , the sheriff of New Haven , an acquaintance that may have been made through the membership of both Mansfield and Arnold in the local Masonic Lodge .
Reinforcements led by William Phillips -LRB- who served under Burgoyne at Saratoga -RRB- arrived in late March , and Phillips led further raids across Virginia , including a defeat of Baron von Steuben at Petersburg , until his death of fever on May 12 , 1781 .
Arnold received Jameson &apos; s letter while waiting for Washington , with whom he had planned to have breakfast .
Arnold then traveled to Montreal , where he served as military commander of the city until forced to retreat by an advancing British army that had arrived at Quebec in May .
Clinton , concerned that Washington &apos; s army and the French fleet would join in Rhode Island , again fixed on West Point as a strategic point to capture .
On September 4 , not long after the birth of his and Peggy &apos; s second son , Arnold &apos; s force of over 1,700 men raided and burned New London and captured Fort Griswold , causing damage estimated at $ 500,000 .
He was again severely wounded in the left leg late in the fighting .
He then directed the construction of a fleet to defend Lake Champlain , which was defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island .
The first major biography of Arnold , The Life and Treason of Benedict Arnold , published in 1832 by historian Jared Sparks , was particularly harsh in showing how Arnold &apos; s treacherous character was allegedly formed out of childhood experiences .
He led British forces on raids in Virginia , and against New London and Groton , Connecticut , before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown .
After the plot was exposed in September 1780 , he was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general .
While en route to West Point , Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith , someone Arnold knew had done spy work for both sides , and who owned a house near the western bank of the Hudson just south of West Point .
As a result of a clerical error in the parish records , his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later .
His father &apos; s alcoholism and ill health kept him from training Arnold in the family mercantile business , but his mother &apos; s family connections secured an apprenticeship for Arnold with two of her cousins , brothers Daniel and Joshua Lathrop , who operated a successful apothecary and general merchandise trade in Norwich .
Word of the siege &apos; s disastrous outcome led the company to turn around ; Arnold served for 13 days .
In 1757 , when he was sixteen , he did enlist in the militia , which marched off toward Albany and Lake George .
Arnold &apos; s contributions to American independence are largely underrepresented in popular culture , while his name became synonymous with traitor in the 19th century .
Peggy had been courted by British Major John AndrÃ during the British occupation of Philadelphia .
Arnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army , an annual pension of Â # 360 , and a lump sum of over Â # 6,000 .
Even before Cornwallis &apos; surrender in October , Arnold had requested permission from Clinton to go to England to give Lord Germain his thoughts on the war in person .
Due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines , neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement to that offer .
Arnold was on his way to Philadelphia to discuss his future when he was alerted that a British force was marching toward a supply depot in Danbury , Connecticut .
This work , which he hoped would earn him wider respect and a new command , instead earned him and his sons a land grant of 15000 a in Upper Canada , near present-day Renfrew , Ontario .
He traveled extensively in the course of his business , throughout New England and from Quebec to the West Indies , often in command of one of his own ships .
Arnold then applied to accompany General Carleton , who was going to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief ; this request went nowhere .
Only Benedict and his sister Hannah survived to adulthood ; his other siblings succumbed to yellow fever in childhood .
The house at 62 Gloucester Place where Arnold lived in central London still stands , bearing a plaque that describes Arnold as an `` American Patriot &apos; &apos; .
In spite of successes , Arnold was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments .
On the battlefield at Saratoga , now preserved in Saratoga National Historical Park , stands a monument in memorial to Arnold , but there is no mention of his name on the engraving .
Other attempts to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years all failed , and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service .
After her first voyage , Arnold returned to London in 1786 to bring his family to Saint John .
Arnold took the opportunity while near his home in New Haven to visit his children , and he spent much of the winter socializing in Boston , where he unsuccessfully courted a young belle named Betsy Deblois .
Arnold attempted to justify his actions in an open letter titled To the Inhabitants of America , published in newspapers in October 1780 .
They issued him a colonel &apos; s commission on May 3 , 1775 , and he immediately rode off to the west , arriving at Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants -LRB- present-day Vermont -RRB- in time to participate with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga .
A significant number of these documents were lost during the retreat from Quebec ; angry and frustrated , Arnold resigned his military command of Philadelphia in late April .
General Parsons , seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion , laid it aside .
In a July 11 letter , he complained that the British did not appear to trust him , and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made .
His actions at Saint-Jean and Valcour Island played a notable role in delaying the British advance against Ticonderoga until 1777 .
It described a boy who stole eggs from birds &apos; nests , pulled wings off insects , and engaged in other sorts of wanton cruelty , who then grew up to become a traitor to his country .
In 1762 , with the help of the Lathrops , Arnold established himself in business as a pharmacist and bookseller in New Haven , Connecticut .
This action did sufficient damage that she was retreated downriver , forcing AndrÃ to return to New York overland .
Sometime early in May 1779 , Arnold met with Stansbury .
Ignoring instructions from Arnold to involve no one else in the plot , Stansbury crossed the British lines and went to see Jonathan Odell in New York .
On July 12 he wrote again , making explicit the offer to surrender West Point , although his price -LRB- in addition to indemnification for his losses -RRB- rose to Â # 20,000 , with a Â # 1,000 downpayment to be delivered with the response .
When he reached Connecticut Arnold arranged to sell his home there , and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York .
Arnold , who was promoted to brigadier general for his role in reaching Quebec , maintained an ineffectual siege of the city until he was replaced by Major General David Wooster in April 1776 .
During these actions , Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress .
On the night of January 28 , 1767 , Arnold and members of his crew , watched by a crowd of Sons , roughed up a man suspected of attempting to inform authorities of Arnold &apos; s smuggling .
Along with David Wooster and Connecticut militia General Gold S. Silliman he organized the militia response .
Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to kidnap Arnold ; this plan , which very nearly succeeded , failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December .
His father &apos; s alcoholism worsened after the death of his wife , and the youth took on the responsibility of supporting his father and younger sister .
AndrÃ , who had spies and informers keeping track of Arnold , verified his movements .
He also provided information on a proposed French-American invasion of Quebec that was to go up the Connecticut River .
His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 , defensive and delaying tactics despite losing the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 , the Battle of Ridgefield , Connecticut -LRB- after which he was promoted to major general -RRB- , operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix , and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777 , in which he suffered leg injuries that ended his combat career for several years .
British casualties were highâ &apos; &apos; nearly one quarter of the force was killed or wounded , a rate at which Clinton claimed he could ill afford more such victories .
Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin , the last Colonial Governor of New Jersey and the son of Benjamin Franklin .
AndrÃ conferred with General Clinton , who gave him broad authority to pursue Arnold &apos; s offer .
The latter act prompted Arnold to join the chorus of voices in opposition to those taxes , and also led to his entry into the Sons of Liberty , a secret organization that was not afraid to use violence to oppose implementation of those and other unpopular Parliamentary measures .
Arnold &apos; s mother , to whom he was very close , died in 1759 .
By July 1779 , Arnold was providing the British with troop locations and strengths , as well as the locations of supply depots , all the while negotiating over compensation .
In a recent reference , Dan Gilbert , owner of the National Basketball Association &apos; s Cleveland Cavaliers , subtly invoked Arnold in 2010 .
Arnold commanded the army only until May 20 , when Lord Cornwallis arrived with the southern army and took over .
Stansbury , whose testimony before a British commission apparently erroneously placed the date in June , said that , after meeting with Arnold , `` I went secretly to New York with a tender of -LRB- Arnold &apos; s -RRB- services to Sir Henry Clinton . &apos; &apos;
Upset over the manner in which LeBron James announced his departure from the team , Gilbert &apos; s company lowered the price of posters bearing James &apos; s likeness to $ 17.41 , referring to the year of Arnold &apos; s birth .
He did , however , investigate the extent of the betrayal , and suggested in negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major AndrÃ that he was willing to exchange AndrÃ for Arnold .
This activity brought Virginia &apos; s militia out , and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced .
Needed repairs on the chain across the Hudson were never ordered .
Only action by Gates , then his superior at Ticonderoga , prevented his own arrest on countercharges levelled by Hazen .
Washington Irving used it as part of an argument against dismemberment of the union in his 1857 Life of George Washington , pointing out that only the unity of New England and the southern states that led to independence was made possible in part by holding West Point .
Arnold &apos; s letters continued to detail Washington &apos; s troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized .
After joining the growing army outside Boston , he distinguished himself through acts of cunning and bravery .
By October 1779 , the negotiations had ground to a halt .
Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance , but he was acquitted in most formal inquiries .
In 1755 , Arnold , attracted by the sound of a drummer , attempted to enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French , but his mother refused permission .
Arnold was rebuffed by Congress and by local authorities in requests for security details for himself and his in-laws .
When a Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June , he had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort , and resigned his Massachusetts commission .
Arnold reopened the secret channels with the British , informing them of Schuyler &apos; s proposals and including Schuyler &apos; s assessment of conditions and West Point .
When the Second Continental Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec , in part on the urging of Arnold , he was passed over for command of the expedition .
Among his bequests were considerable gifts to one John Sage , who turned out to be an illegitimate son conceived during his time in New Brunswick .
The family left Saint John to return to London in December 1791 .
Early biographers attempted to describe Arnold &apos; s entire life in terms of treacherous or morally questionable behavior .
The church where Arnold was buried , St. Mary &apos; s Church , Battersea , England , has a commemorative stained-glass window which was added between 1976 and 1982 .
Even before the Americans reoccupied Philadelphia , Arnold began planning to capitalize financially on the change in power there , engaging in a variety of business deals designed to profit from war-related supply movements and benefiting from the protection of his authority .
Margaret died early in the revolution , on June 19 , 1775 , while Arnold was at Fort Ticonderoga following its capture .
His funeral procession boasted `` seven mourning coaches and four state carriages &apos; &apos; ; the funeral was without military honors .
His action at Ridgefield , coupled with the death of Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action , resulted in Arnold &apos; s promotion to major general , although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him .
Jefferson Davis and other southern secessionist leaders were unfavorably compared to Arnold , implicitly and explicitly likening the idea of secession to treason .
This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river , not having been informed of his impending arrival , fired on his boat .
Clinton , however , was not interested in most of Arnold &apos; s aggressive ideas , but finally relented and authorized Arnold to raid the port of New London , Connecticut .
This expedition , for which Arnold received a colonel &apos; s commission in the Continental Army , left Cambridge in September 1775 with 1,100 men .
One plaque bears only a rank , `` major general &apos; &apos; and a date , `` born 1740 &apos; &apos; , and no name .
A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence .
Arnold arrived in Schuyler &apos; s camp at Fort Edward , New York on July 24 .
On one of his voyages , Arnold fought a duel in Honduras with a British sea captain who had called him a `` damned Yankee , destitute of good manners or those of a gentleman &apos; &apos; .
Four days later , Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of a prisoner-of-war &apos; s wife .
Arnold next wrote a series of letters to Clinton , even before he might have expected a response to the July 7 letter .
Furthermore , Patriot mobs were scouring Philadelphia for Loyalists , and Arnold and the Shippen family were being threatened .
Arnold wrote out passes for AndrÃ so that he would be able to pass through the lines , and also gave him plans for West Point .
He made all haste to the shore and ordered bargemen to row him downriver to where the Vulture was anchored , which then took him to New York .
He began the war in the Continental Army but later defected to the British Army .
Excited by the prospects , Clinton informed his superiors of his intelligence coups , but failed to respond to Arnold &apos; s July 7 letter .

These further aerobic reactions use pyruvate and NADH + H + from glycolysis .
Since glucose leads to two triose sugars in the preparatory phase , each reaction in the pay-off phase occurs twice per glucose molecule .
It occurs , with variations , in nearly all organisms , both aerobic and anaerobic .
This yields 2 NADH molecules and 4 ATP molecules , leading to a net gain of 2 NADH molecules and 2 ATP molecules from the glycolytic pathway per glucose .
Glycolysis is thought to be the archetype of a universal metabolic pathway .
The wide occurrence of glycolysis indicates that it is one of the most ancient known metabolic pathways .
The second half of glycolysis is known as the pay-off phase , characterised by a net gain of the energy-rich molecules ATP and NADH .
Cells performing aerobic respiration synthesize much more ATP , but not as part of glycolysis .
Eukaryotic aerobic respiration produces approximately 34 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule , however most of these are produced by a vastly different mechanism to the substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis .

Early on October 6 , the NHC issued their final advisory on Grace as it merged with a frontal system over the northeastern Atlantic .
The first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 : 00 AST on October 4 ; at this time , the system was officially named Grace , the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season .
The storm intensified slightly as it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures , with winds estimated at 70 mph -LRB- 110 km \ / h -RRB- early on October 5 .
Just prior to merging , the lowest pressure in relation to the storm was recorded at 986 mbar -LRB- hPa ; 29.12 inHg -RRB- .
Gusts up to 44 m were recorded on Ponta Delgada .
Operationally , Grace was not classified a tropical storm until it reached latitude 41.2 Â N. This marked the second northernmost formation of a tropical storm in the Atlantic on record ; only Tropical Storm Alberto of 1988 had formed farther north .
In Ireland , 1.18 i of precipitation fell in the city of Cork .
The following day , convection began to decrease around the low and the National Hurricane Center -LRB- NHC -RRB- ceased monitoring it .
Although the storm was tropical at this time , the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours .
Over the following three days , the system was not mentioned in the NHC &apos; s tropical weather outlooks until just prior to Grace &apos; s classification .
Sustained winds in the city were recorded up to 23 m . Rainfall in the country peaked at 48 m in Wexford .
The storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye-like feature .
One ship , the Cap Castillo -LRB- call sign A8PI5 -RRB- , recorded sustained winds of 45 m on October 5 , while located about 110 m south of the storm &apos; s center .
Tropical Storm Grace holds the record as the tropical cyclone to form farthest northeast in the Atlantic basin .
By this time , the storm was over 18 C waters , likely inhibiting convective development .
By October 1 , convection began to develop near the center of the system as it tracked through the central Azores .
While merging with the frontal system on October 6 , the storm &apos; s outer bands produced heavy rains and strong winds over parts of Portugal , resulting in some street flooding .
The seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season , Grace formed out of an extratropical cyclone over the Azores on October 4 .
The strongest winds were recorded at 8 on the Beaufort scale , corresponding to gale-force winds .
However , in a post-storm analysis from the NHC , it was found that Grace attained peak winds of 65 mph -LRB- 100 km \ / h -RRB- , slightly lower than operationally stated .
The storm &apos; s remnants persisted for most of October 6 before dissipating over England .
Over the following two days , the system executed a counter-clockwise loop near the Azores .
Near the coastline of Wales , a buoy recorded sustained winds up to 41 m , equivalent to a minimal tropical storm .
In higher elevations , wind gusts were estimated to have exceeded 80 k .
Tropical Storm Grace originated from a large extratropical cyclone that formed along a cold front on September 27 , 2009 roughly 470 mi -LRB- 755 km -RRB- east of Cape Race , Newfoundland .
Late on October 6 , the remnants of Grace moved inland over Wales , bringing heavy rains and high winds to the region .
However , a post-storm analysis concluded that Grace had actually become a tropical storm 12 hours earlier than initially estimated , placing its location of development further south , at 38.5 Â N. The storm still marked the farthest northeast a tropical cyclone formed in the Atlantic basin , breaking the record set by Hurricane Vince in 2005 .
During the afternoon of October 4 , convection redeveloped around the center of the low and was classified as a tropical storm near SÃ # o Miguel Island .
The extratropical remnants of Grace persisted for roughly 18 hours before dissipating over the Celtic Sea early on October 7 .

By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit : the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle -LRB- or Northern Hound -RRB- .

Snoopy of the comic strip Peanuts has been promoted as `` the world &apos; s most famous beagle &apos; &apos; .
Beagles are scent hounds , developed primarily for tracking hare , rabbit , and other game .
Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings , and more recently in film , television and comic books .
Dogs of similar size and purpose to the modern Beagle can be traced in Ancient Greece back to around the 5th century BC .
Small enough to fit in a `` pocket &apos; &apos; or saddlebag , they rode along on the hunt .
Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups .
Beagles are intelligent , and are popular as pets because of their size , even temper , and lack of inherited health problems .
From medieval times , beagle was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds , though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed .
The Beagle is a breed of small to medium-sized dog .
In the 11th century , William the Conqueror brought the Talbot hound to Britain .
Although beagle-type dogs have existed for over 2,000 years , the modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds , including the Talbot Hound , the North Country Beagle , the Southern Hound , and possibly the Harrier .
At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed .
Xenophon , born around 433 BC , in his Treatise on Hunting or Cynegeticus refers to a hound that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot .
Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII , who both had packs of Glove Beagles , so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove , and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle , which stood 8 t at the shoulder .
In George Jesse &apos; s Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866 , the early 17th century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the Beagle as small enough to sit on a man &apos; s hand and to the : Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901 ; these genetic lines are now extinct , although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety .
The Talbot was a predominantly white , slow , deep-throated , scent hound derived from the St. Hubert Hound which had been developed in the 8th century .
If genuine , these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in England before 1016 , but it is likely the laws were written in the Middle Ages to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to Forest Law .

Ventricular fibrillation -LRB- V-fib or VF -RRB- is a condition in which there is uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of the ventricles in the heart , making them quiver rather than contract properly .
Antiarrhythmic agents like amiodarone or lidocaine can help , but , unlike atrial fibrillation , ventricular fibrillation rarely reverses spontaneously in large adult mammals .
Ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death .
In patients at high risk of ventricular fibrillation , the use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator has been shown to be beneficial .
The ventricular muscle twitches randomly , rather than contracting in a coordinated fashion -LRB- from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles -RRB- , and so the ventricles fail to pump blood into the arteries and into systemic circulation .
It is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause , the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation .

When ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field , the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field , thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains . Since a bar magnet gets its ferromagnetism from electrons distributed evenly throughout the bar , when a bar magnet is cut in half , each of the resulting pieces is a smaller bar magnet .
Even though a magnet is said to have a north pole and a south pole , these two poles can not be separated from each other .
A very common source of magnetic field shown in nature is a dipole , with a `` South pole &apos; &apos; and a `` North pole &apos; &apos; , terms dating back to the use of magnets as compasses , interacting with the Earth &apos; s magnetic field to indicate North and South on the globe .
Since opposite ends of magnets are attracted , the north pole of a magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet .

More modern louver windows comprise slats of glass , opened and closed with a metal lever , or they may be shutters of wood , plastic or other material .
A second example , taking influence from Aalto , is the second-generation modernist architect Juha LeiviskÃ .
Later they evolved into more elaborate designs made of pottery , taking the shape of faces where the smoke and steam from cooking would pour out through the eyes and mouth , or into constructions that were more like modern louvers , with slats that could be opened or closed by pulling on a string .
A louver -LRB- American English -RRB- or louvre -LRB- British English -RRB- , from the French l &apos;ouvert ; `` the open one &apos; &apos; -RRB- is a window , blind or shutter with horizontal slats that are angled to admit light and air , but to keep out rain , direct sunshine , and noise .
Louvers originated in the Middle Ages as lantern-like constructions in wood that were fitted on top of roof holes in large kitchens to allow ventilation while keeping out rain and snow .
They were originally rather crude constructions consisting merely of a barrel .
The most well-known example is Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto who would create aesthetic effects in the facades of his buildings through the combination of different types and sizes of louvers , some fixed some moveable , and made mostly from wood -LRB- e.g. the various buildings of the Helsinki University of Technology -RRB- .
Such louvers may be integrated in between two panes of double glazing .
However , there are examples of architects who use them as part of the overall aesthetic effect of their buildings .
Additionally , louvers are used as semi-passive means of thermal control on spacecraft .

Because the Planck length is the only length that can be formed from the constants c , G , and Ä , dimensional analysis suggests that lengths of special significance in quantum gravity are likely to be small multiples of the Planck length . In some theories or forms of quantum gravity , it is the length scale at which the structure of spacetime becomes dominated by quantum effects , giving it a discrete or foamy structure , but other theories of quantum gravity predict no such effects .
It is a base unit in the system of Planck units . The Planck length can be defined from three fundamental physical constants : the speed of light in a vacuum , Planck &apos; s constant , and the gravitational constant .

Carolingian minuscule was the direct ancestor of blackletter .
Flavio Biondo , in Italia Illustrata -LRB- 1531 -RRB- thought it was invented by the Lombards after their invasion of Italy in the 6th century .
Lieftinck also divided cursiva into three styles : littera cursiva formata was the most legible and calligraphic style .
As early as the 11th century , different forms of Carolingian were already being used , and by the mid-12th century , a clearly distinguishable form , able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new books , was being used in northeastern France and the Low Countries .
Blackletter developed from Carolingian as an increasingly literate 12th-century Europe required new books in many different subjects .
Textualis was most widely used in France , the Low Countries , England , and Germany .
The letters a , g , and s -LRB- at the end of a word -RRB- are very similar to their Carolingian forms .
Some characteristics of the script are :
Littera cursiva currens was used for textbooks and other unimportant books and it had very little standardization in forms .
Characteristics of Fraktur are :
Not only were black-letter forms called Gothic script , but any other seemingly barbarian script , such as Visigothic , Beneventan , and Merovingian , were also labeled `` Gothic &apos; &apos; , in contrast to Carolingian minuscule , a highly legible script which the Humanists called littera antiqua , `` the ancient letter &apos; &apos; , wrongly believing that it was the script used by the Romans .
It is a mixture of textualis and cursiva , developed in the early 15th century .
These books needed to be produced quickly to keep up with demand .
Hybrida is also called bastarda -LRB- especially in France -RRB- , and as its name suggests , refers to a hybrid form of the script .
Cursiva refers to a very large variety of forms of black letter ; as with modern cursive writing , there is no real standard form .
Littera cursiva textualis -LRB- or libraria -RRB- was the usual form , used for writing standard books , and it generally was written with a larger pen , leading to larger letters .
It developed in the 14th century as a simplified form of textualis , with influence from the form of textualis as used for writing charters .
Carolingian , though legible , was time-consuming and labour-intensive to produce .
It was invented in the reign of Charlemagne , although only used significantly after that era .
The black letter must not be confused either with the ancient alphabet of the Gothic language , nor with the sans-serif typefaces that are also sometimes called Gothic .
Its use was so common that often any black-letter form is called Fraktur in Germany .
For Lieftinck , the highest form of textualis was littera textualis formata , used for de luxe manuscripts .
It continued to be used occasionally until the 20th century .
It was therefore , easier to write quickly on paper in a cursive script .
Schwabacher was a black-letter form that was much used in early German print typefaces .
The term Gothic was first used to describe this script in 15th-century Italy , in the midst of the Renaissance , because Renaissance Humanists believed it was barbaric .
In cursiva , descenders are more frequent , especially in the letters f and s , and ascenders are curved and looped rather than vertical -LRB- seen especially in the letter d -RRB- .
Cursiva developed partly because of the introduction of paper , which was smoother than parchment .
From textualis , it borrowed vertical ascenders , while from cursiva , it borrowed long f and Å , single-looped a , and g with an open descender -LRB- similar to Carolingian forms -RRB- .
According to Dutch scholar Gerard Lieftinck , the pinnacle of black-letter use occurred in the 14th and 15th centuries .
Textualis , also known as textura or Gothic bookhand , was the most calligraphic form of black letter , and today is the form most associated with `` Gothic &apos; &apos; .
Fraktur is a form of black letter that became the most common German black-letter typeface by the mid 16th century .
Johannes Gutenberg carved a textualis typeface â `` including a large number of ligatures and common abbreviations â `` when he printed his 42-line Bible .
Lieftinck &apos; s third form , littera textualis currens , was the cursive form of black letter , extremely difficult to read and used for textual glosses , and less important books .
Characteristics of Schwabacher are :
Gothic was a synonym for barbaric .
Its large size consumed a lot of manuscript space in a time when writing materials were very costly .
New universities were founded , each producing books for business , law , grammar , history , and other pursuits , not solely religious works for which earlier scripts typically had been used .
However , not all of these features are found in every example of cursiva , which makes it difficult to determine whether or not a script may be called cursiva at all .
However , the textualis was rarely used for typefaces afterwards .
The usual form , simply littera textualis , was used for literary works and university texts .

Alternative country -LRB- sometimes alt-country , insurgent country , or Americana -RRB- is a loosely defined sub-genre of country music , which includes acts that differ significantly in style from mainstream or pop country music .
No Depression , the best-known magazine dedicated to the genre , declared that it covered `` alternative-country music -LRB- whatever that is -RRB- &apos; &apos; .
It has been used to describe country music bands and artists that have incorporated influences ranging from roots rock , bluegrass , rockabilly , honky-tonk , alternative rock , folk rock , and particularly punk .
Bottle Rockets signed , along with acts like Freakwater , The Old 97 &apos; s and Robbie Fulks , to the Chicago-based indie label , Bloodshot , who pioneered a version of the genre under the name insurgent country .
Lyrics may be bleak , gothic , or socially aware , but also more heartfelt and less-often follow the clichÃ s sometimes used by mainstream country musicians .
The bands Blue Mountain , Whiskeytown , Blood Oranges and Drive-By Truckers further developed this tradition before most began to move more in the direction of rock music in the 2000s .
This already broad labeling has been further confused by alternative country artists disavowing the movement , mainstream artists declaring they are part of it , and retroactive claims that past or veteran musicians are alternative country .
Attempts to combine punk and country had been pioneered in the 1980s Southern Californian cowpunk scene with bands like Jason and the Scorchers , but these styles merged fully in Uncle Tupelo &apos; s 1990 LP No Depression , which is widely credited as being the first `` alt-country &apos; &apos; album , and gave its name to the online notice board and eventually magazine that underpinned the movement .

Der Wanderer -LRB- D. 493 -RRB- is the name of a Lied composed by Franz Schubert in October 1816 for voice and piano .
Towards the end of this section , the music gets quite animated and forms the climax of the song .
Next the music shifts to the key of E major , the tempo increases and the time signature changes to 6 \ / 8 .
The wanderer asks : `` where are you my beloved land ? &apos; &apos;
The piece has a total of 72 measures .
The song begins with a recitative , describing the setting : mountains , a steaming valley , the roaring sea .
from the opening , the song closes with a `` ghostly breath &apos; &apos; finally answering the question : `` There where you are not , there is happiness . &apos; &apos;
Finally , the music returns to the original minor key and slow tempo .
The words are taken from a German poem by Georg Philipp Schmidt -LRB- von LÃ 1 \ / 4 beck -RRB- .
The lied is set in the key of C-sharp minor with the tempo marking sehr langsam -LRB- very slow -RRB- and the time signature alla breve .
The song closes in the key of E major .
This 8 bar section was later used by Schubert as theme for a set of variations forming the second movement of the Wanderer Fantasy .
The next section , consisting of 8 bars of a slow melody sung in pianissimo , describes the feelings of the wanderer : the sun seems cold , the blossom withered , life old . The wanderer expresses the conviction of being a stranger everywhere .
After quoting the question `` where ? &apos; &apos;
The wanderer is strolling quietly , unhappily , and asks , sighing , the question : `` where ? &apos; &apos;
Schubert wrote another lied entitled `` Der Wanderer ; &apos; &apos; it is numbered D. 649 .

Patroclus orbits in Jupiter &apos; s trailing Lagrangian point , , in an orbit called the ` Trojan node &apos; after one of the sides in the legendary Trojan War -LRB- the other node is called the ` Greek node &apos; -RRB- .
Because of the density of the components -LRB- 0.8 g \ / cm Â -RRB- is less than water and about one third that of rock , the team of researchers led by F. Marchis suggest that the Patroclus system , previously thought to be a pair of rocky asteroids , is more similar to a comet in composition .
It is suspected that many Trojan asteroids are in fact small planetesimals captured in the Lagrange point of Jupiter-Sun system during the outer migration of the giant planets , 3.9 billion years ago .
They estimated that the two components orbit around their center of mass in 4.283 Â 0.004 d at a distance of 680 Â 20 km , describing a roughly circular orbit .
Patroclus is the only object in the Trojan camp to be named after a Greek character ; the naming conventions for the trojan asteroids were not adopted until after Patroclus was named -LRB- similarly , the asteroid Hektor is the only Trojan character to appear in the Greek camp -RRB- .

In 2001 , it was discovered that Patroclus is a binary object , made up of two components of roughly similar size .
The slightly larger component , which measures 122 km in diameter , retains the name Patroclus .
Combining their observations with thermal measurements taken in November 2000 , the team estimated the size of the components of the system .
The smaller component , measuring 112 km , is now named Menoetius , after the legendary Patroclus &apos; s father .
It is classified as a trojan asteroid , sharing an orbit with Jupiter .

A processor that executes every instruction one after the other -LRB- i.e. a non-pipelined scalar architecture -RRB- may use processor resources inefficiently , potentially leading to poor performance .
As a result , VLIW CPUs offer significant computational power with less hardware complexity -LRB- but greater compiler complexity -RRB- than is associated with most superscalar CPUs .
Before executing any operations in parallel , the processor must verify that the instructions do not have interdependencies .
Since determining the order of execution of operations -LRB- including which operations can execute simultaneously -RRB- is handled by the compiler , the processor does not need the scheduling hardware that the three techniques described above require .
For example a first instruction &apos; s result is used as an second instruction &apos; s input .
The acronym VLIW may also refer to Variable Length Instruction Word , a CPU instruction set designed to load -LRB- or copy -RRB- a literal value count of inline Machine code to the on-chip RAM for higher speed CPU decoding .
Clearly , they can not execute at the same time , and the second instruction ca n &apos;t be executed before the first .

Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding and the interactions between the various systems of a cell , including the interactions between the different types of DNA , RNA and protein biosynthesis as well as learning how these interactions are regulated .
Researchers in molecular biology use specific techniques native to molecular biology -LRB- see Techniques section later in article -RRB- , but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from genetics and biochemistry .
The figure above is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields :
Increasingly many other loops of biology focus on molecules , either directly studying their interactions in their own right such as in cell biology and developmental biology , or indirectly , where the techniques of molecular biology are used to infer historical attributes of populations or species , as in fields in evolutionary biology such as population genetics and phylogenetics .
Much of the work in molecular biology is quantitative , and recently much work has been done at the interface of molecular biology and computer science in bioinformatics and computational biology . As of the early 2000s , the study of gene structure and function , molecular genetics , has been among the most prominent sub-field of molecular biology .
This field overlaps with other areas of biology and chemistry , particularly genetics and biochemistry .

Victor Amadeus II -LRB- Vittorio Amedeo Sebastiano ; 14 May 1666 â `` 31 October 1732 -RRB- was Duke of Savoy from 1675 to 1730 .
Victor Amadeus organised the first two marriages of Charles Emmanuel the first one being to Anne Christine of Sulzbach , daughter of the Count Palatine of Sulzbach which produced a son which died in infancy .
Under the influence of Louis XIV and Marie Jeanne Victor Amadeus was forced to marry a French princess Anne Marie d &apos;Orl Ã ans .
At the death of the Prince of Piedmont in 1715 from smallpox Anne Marie died in 1728 after a series of heart attacks .
Three of these children would go on to have further progeny including the eldest Maria Adelaide who was the mother of Louis XV of France .
His second daughter Maria Luisa known in the family as Louison would marry Philip V of Spain in 1701 and was also regent of Spain for various periods .
Having fought in the War of the Spanish Succession , he became king of Sicily in 1713 but he was forced to exchange this title and instead became king of Sardinia to which his direct descendants claim as part of the Kingdom of Italy .
His favorite child was Victor Amadeus born in 1699 and given the title Prince of Piedmont as heir apparent .
Victor Amadeus subsequently had his daughter including the future Maria Vittoria marry the Prince of Carignan from which the present Vittorio Emanuele , Prince of Naples is a direct descendant .
Anne Marie would remain a devoted wife .
These two marriages were tactics used by Louis XIV to keep Victor Amadeus close to France prior to the War of the Spanish Succession .
She quietly accepted his extramarital affairs the longest one being with the famed beauty Jeanne Baptiste d &apos;Albert de Luynes by whom he had two children .
Louis XIV organised his marriage in order to maintain French influence in the Duchy but Victor Amadeus soon broke away from the influence of France .
Jeanne Baptiste was his mistress for eleven years and eventually fled Savoy due to Victor Amadeus &apos; obsession with her .
Anne Marie gave her husband six children but also had two stillbirths of each gender one in 1691 and again in 1697 .
Victor Amadeus left a considerable cultural influence in Turin remodeling the Royal Palace of Turin , Palace of Venaria , Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi as well as building the Basilica of Superga where he rests .
His distant relationship with his mother was always strained and has been blamed on her ambition to keep power to herself .
His relationship with his younger son and eventual successor Charles Emmanuel was a cold one and the two were never close .
At his father &apos; s death in 1675 , his mother took over a regency in the name of her nine year old son and would remain in de facto power till 1684 when Victor Amadeus banished her further involvement in the state .
The second marriage was to Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg a first cousin of Anne Christine and mother of six children including the future Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia .

Viking Age is the term for the period in European history , especially Northern European and Scandinavian history , spanning the late 8th to 11th centuries .
At the start of the Viking age , the Vikings adhered to the Norse religion and system of beliefs .
The lower class of society would go to a place called `` hel &apos; &apos; , similar to life on earth .
Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain .
It was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that the Northmen raided the important island monastery of Lindisfarne : `` AD .
The introduction of Christianity did not immediately end Viking voyages , but it may have been a contributing factor to bringing the Viking Age to an end .
Several generations later , the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as French but carried the French language , and their variant of the French culture , into England in 1066 .
The end of the Viking-era in Norway is marked by the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030 .

- Anglo Saxon Chronicle .
The beginning of the Viking Age in the British Isles is , however , often given as 793 .
Until recently the history of the Viking Age was largely based on Icelandic Sagas , the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus , the Russian Primary Chronicle and The War of the Irish with the Foreigners .
During the latter half of the 18th century the Icelandic Sagas were still used as important historical sources , but the Viking Age was regarded as a barbaric and uncivilized period in the history of the Nordic countries .
In England the Viking Age began dramatically on June 16 , 793 when Vikings destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne , a center of learning famous across the continent .
Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings .
The earliest date given for a Viking raid is 787 AD when , according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , a group of men from Norway sailed to the Isle of Portland in Dorset .
In Scandinavia the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion .
Historians also suggest that the Scandinavian population was too large for the peninsula and there was not enough good farmland for everyone .
Monks were killed in the abbey , thrown into the sea to drown or carried away as slaves along with the church treasures .
The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to grapple with the primary Icelandic Sagas .
In 911 , French King Charles the Simple was able to make an agreement with the Viking warleader Rollo , a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins .
The first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century .
Particularly for the settlement and conquest period that followed the early raids , internal strife in Scandinavia resulted in the progressive centralisation of power into fewer hands .
Iceland became Europe &apos; s first modern republic , with an annual assembly of elected officials called the Althing -- though only Godi -LRB- wealthy landowners -RRB- had the vote there .
According to Viking beliefs , Viking chieftains would please their war-gods by their bravery , and would become `` worth-ship ; &apos; &apos; that is , the chieftain would earn a `` burial at sea &apos; &apos; .
More than any other single event , the attack on Lindisfarne cast a shadow on the perception of the Vikings for the next twelve centuries .
`` Never before has such an atrocity been seen , &apos; &apos; declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York .
These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine : and not long after , on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year , the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island -LRB- Lindisfarne -RRB- , by rapine and slaughter . &apos; &apos;
Some farmers even called their fields after Freyr , in the hope that this would ensure a good harvest .
Freyr and his sister Freya were fertility gods .
From bases there , the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802 , causing great slaughter amongst the CÃ li DÃ Brethren , and burning the abbey to the ground .
There , they were mistaken for merchants by a royal official .
This led to a hunt for more land .
They believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses , as well as Valhalla , a heaven for warriors .
Some of the most important trading ports during the period include both existing and ancient cities such as Aarhus -LRB- Denmark -RRB- , Ribe -LRB- Denmark -RRB- , Hedeby -LRB- Germany -RRB- , Vineta -LRB- Pomerania -RRB- , Truso -LRB- Poland -RRB- , Kaupang -LRB- Norway -RRB- , Birka -LRB- Sweden -RRB- , Bordeaux -LRB- France -RRB- , York -LRB- England -RRB- , Dublin -LRB- Ireland -RRB- and Aldeigjuborg -LRB- Russia -RRB- .
Formerly empowered local lords who did not want to be oppressed by greedy kings emigrated overseas .
Near the end of Charlemagne &apos; s reign -LRB- and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons -RRB- , a string of Norse raids began , culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as Normandy .
With the Norman Conquest , they became the ruling aristocracy of Anglo-Saxon England .
Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources ; historians today rely more on archaeology and numismatics , disciplines that have made valuable contributions toward understanding the period .
This year came dreadful fore-warnings over the land of the Northumbrians , terrifying the people most woefully : these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air , and whirlwinds , and fiery dragons flying across the firmament .
The end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III -LRB- Haraldr HarÃ rÃ Ã i -RRB- , who was defeated by Saxon King Harold Godwinson in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge ; in Ireland , the capture of Dublin by Strongbow and his Hiberno-Norman forces in 1171 ; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King HÃ kon HÃ konarson at the Battle of Largs by troops loyal to Alexander III .
The Vikings also reached Iceland , Greenland , Newfoundland , and Anatolia .
Towards the end of the Viking Age , more and more Scandinavians were converted to Christianity .
The Kingdom of the Franks under Charlemagne was particularly hard-hit by these raiders , who could sail down the Seine with near impunity .
The Viking devastation of Northumbria &apos; s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal Courts of Europe .
They also performed land burials which often still included a ship , treasure , weapons , tools , clothing and even slaves and women buried alive with the dead chieftain , for his `` journey to Valhalla , and adventure and pleasure in the after-life . &apos; &apos;
In 794 , according to the Annals of Ulster , there was a serious attack on Lindisfarne &apos; s mother-house of Iona , which was followed in 795 by raids upon the northern coast of Ireland .
They murdered him when he tried to get them to accompany him to the king &apos; s manor to pay a trading tax on their goods .
Sages then composed sagas about the exploits of these chieftains , keeping their memories alive .
The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries .

Note that any data fed to the smallimage , smallimageright and smalltext parameters is only used if `` small = yes &apos; &apos; .
Such banners have special programming constraints that merit their own meta-templates .
That is the usual way we make meta-templates since wiki markup has several drawbacks .
This template uses the tmbox CSS classes in MediaWiki : Common .
If the imageright parameter also is empty then no image is shown on the right side .
-LRB- But the message box can handle images of any size . -RRB-
If the image parameter also is empty then a small default image is used .
And now a pipe and end braces -RCB- -RCB- .
image No parameter = If no image parameter is given the template uses a default image .
For more technical details see the talk page .
smallimageright No parameter = If no smallimageright parameter is given then this template falls back to use the imageright parameter .
This template works similarly to and uses the same parameters .
An image = Should be an image with usual wiki notation .
small yes = Makes it a smaller right floating message box .
This template should not be used for WikiProject banners .
The following examples use different type parameters but use no image parameters thus they use the default images for each type .
Anything = Any other object that you want to show on the right side .
That means it gets a gray border .
When deciding on the type to use for a talkpage messagebox , please consider the following guidelines :
After discussions on the talk page of this template and announcing it at several places for some time we are now deploying this template .
Internally this meta-template uses HTML markup instead of wiki markup for the table code .
When this template is used to build talk page message boxes those boxes should contain explanatory texts just like before .
If you find any tricky cases then list them on the talk page of this template and you &apos; ll get help .
If there are more specific images in the boxes or you know a better image , then use them instead of the default images shown here .
text The message body text .
Since this template works almost exactly like , , and their talk pages and related pages might also contain more details .
This overrides any image fed to image , when `` small = yes &apos; &apos; .
For instance it makes it harder to use parser functions and special characters in parameters .
See the `` See also &apos; &apos; section below for links .
smallimage No parameter = If no smallimage parameter is given then this template falls back to use the image parameter .
imageright No parameter = If no imageright parameter is given then no image is shown on the right side .
Feel free to convert any message boxes used on talk pages to use this meta-template .
style Optional CSS values used by the entire message box table .
type If no type parameter is given the template defaults to type notice .
30px width is usually about right .
If no smalltext parameter is given then this template falls back to use the text parameter .
none = Means that no image is used .
none = Means that no right side image is used .
This template calls which holds most of the code for , while itself does parameter preprocessing .
Without quotation marks but with the ending semicolons .
-LRB- The same texts as before or new improved texts . -RRB-
This overrides any image fed to imageright , when `` small = yes &apos; &apos; .
The types of talkpage messageboxes follow the same naming convention as the boxes for all other namespaces , but the type of any particular talkpage messagebox may not be as obvious as in other namespaces .
textstyle Optional CSS values used by the text cell .
This also makes the default images smaller .
To make it so your template also understands the small parameter you can use this code : :
Some other parameter combinations .
40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio .
smalltext A shorter version of the message body text .
css for most of its looks , thus it is fully skinnable .
Which default image it uses depends on the type parameter .

As a separate genre , it appears to have no specific form , although most of the divertimenti of the second half of the 18th century go either back to a dance suite approach -LRB- derived from the ` ballet &apos; type of theatrical divertimento -RRB- , or take the form of other chamber music genres of their century -LRB- as a continuation of the merely instrumental theatrical divertimento -RRB- . There are many other terms which describe music similar to the divertimento , including serenade , cassation , notturno , Nachtmusik ; after about 1780 , the divertimento was the term most commonly applied to this light , `` after-dinner &apos; &apos; and often outdoor music .
Several examples exist from the 20th century , including works by Nikolai Medtner , Ferruccio Busoni , Vincent Persichetti , Sergei Prokofiev , BÃ la BartÃ k , Benjamin Britten , Gordon Jacob , Lennox Berkeley , Gareth Walters , Malcolm Arnold , Lars-Erik Larsson , Bohuslav MartinÅ and Igor Stravinsky -LRB- from his ballet to music of Tchaikovsky Le baiser de la fÃ e -RRB- .

Jane Chance -LRB- Professor of English , Rice University -RRB- in her 1980 article `` The Structural Unity of Beowulf : The Problem of Grendel &apos; s Mother &apos; &apos; argued that there are two standard interpretations of the poem : one view which suggests a two-part structure -LRB- i.e. , the poem is divided between Beowulf &apos; s battles with Grendel and with the dragon -RRB- and the other , a three-part structure -LRB- this interpretation argues that Beowulf &apos; s battle with Grendel &apos; s mother is structurally separate from his battle with Grendel -RRB- .
One of his men , however , Wiglaf , who finds great distress in seeing Beowulf &apos; s plight , comes to Beowulf &apos; s aid .
Finally , Beowulf tears Grendel &apos; s arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes to die .
Beowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot .

This process is one aspect of homeostasis : a dynamic state of stability between an animal &apos; s internal environment and its external environment -LRB- the study of such processes in zoology has been called ecophysiology or physiological ecology -RRB- .
Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries , even when the surrounding temperature is very different .
If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs .
The opposite condition , when body temperature decreases below normal levels , is known as hypothermia .
This occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 Â C , any prolonged exposure -LRB- longer than a few hours -RRB- at this temperature and up to around 70 Â C death is almost inevitable .
Afterward , he left their mutilated bodies in front of the palace for all to see .

The treaty further provides that the most recent European elections should be `` taken into account &apos; &apos; when appointing the Commission , although the President is still proposed by the European Council ; the European Parliament would `` elect &apos; &apos; the Commission rather than `` approve &apos; &apos; it as under the Treaty of Nice .
In May 1949 , the Soviets lifted the blockade , and West Berlin as a separate city with its own jurisdiction was maintained .
This circular line connected all train routes heading for West Berlin and accommodated all domestic GDR traffic , thus directing railway traffic into East Berlin while by-passing West Berlin . Commuters in the East German suburbs around West Berlin now boarded Sputnik express trains , which took them into East Berlin without crossing any western sectors .
East Germany closed the borders between East and West Germany and sealed off the border with West Berlin in 1952 ; but because of the quadripartite Allied status of the city , the 46 k-long sectorial border between East and West Berlin remained open . As there was freedom of movement between West Berlin and West Germany , Easterners could use the city as a transit point to West Germany , usually traveling there by air .
The Western Allies did not recognize this claim , as they asserted that the entire city of Berlin was legally under four-power administration .
To stop this drain of people defecting , the East German government built the Berlin Wall , thus physically closing off West Berlin from East Berlin and East Germany , on 13 August 1961 .
By the end of 1949 , two new states had been created out of occupied Germanyâ &apos; &apos; the Federal Republic of Germany -LRB- West Germany -RRB- in the West and the German Democratic Republic -LRB- GDR , East Germany -RRB- in the Eastâ &apos; &apos; with West Berlin an enclave surrounded by , but not part of , the GDR .
On 3 October 1990 , West Berlin and East Berlin were united as the city of Berlin , which then acceded to the Federal Republic as a state .
However , as the relations between the western allies and the Soviet Union soured and the Cold War began , the joint administration of Germany and Berlin broke down .
Hence , the Grundgesetz -LRB- the constitution of the Federal Republic -RRB- was not applicable to West Berlin .
Starting from 31 May 1961 , East Berlin was officially called Berlin , Capital of the GDR -LRB- , replacing the formerly used term Democratic Berlin -RRB- , or simply `` Berlin , &apos; &apos; by East Germany , and `` Berlin -LRB- Ost -RRB- &apos; &apos; by the West German Federal government .
West Berlin and East Berlin thus both formally ceased to exist .
West Berlin consisted of the American , British , and French occupation sectors , which had been established in 1945 .
The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 physically divided East Berlin and West Berlin until the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
East Berlin encompassed the region occupied and administered by the Soviet Union , and was claimed as capital by East Germany .
In 1948 , the Soviets tried to force the Western Allies out of Berlin by imposing a land blockade on the western sectors : the Berlin Blockade .
However , because the occupation of Berlin could only be ended by a quadripartite agreement , Berlin remained an occupied territory under the formal sovereignty of the allies .
The Two Plus Four Treaty , signed by the two German states and the four wartime allies , paved the way for German reunification and an end to the western occupation of West Berlin .
In many ways , West Berlin functioned as the de facto 11th state of West Germany , and was depicted on maps published in the West as being a part of West Germany .
This move was , however , not recognized by the Western Allies , who continued to view all of Berlin as a jointly occupied territory belonging to neither of the two states .
On 9 November 1989 , the Wall was opened , and the two parts of the city were once again physicallyâ &apos; &apos; though at this point not legallyâ &apos; &apos; united .
Berlin &apos; s underground -LRB- Untergrundbahn , U-Bahn -RRB- and Berlin &apos; s S-Bahn -LRB- a metropolitan public transit network -RRB- , rebuilt after the war , continued to span all occupation sectors .
The Soviets unilaterally declared the occupation of East Berlin at an end along with the rest of East Germany .
West Berliners and West Germans who had earlier fled East Germany or East Berlin , and thus could face imprisonment on entering East Germany or East Berlin , could only take flights for travel to and from West Berlin .
Soon Soviet-occupied Berlin and western-occupied Berlin had separate city administrations .
The West German Federal government officially called West Berlin `` Berlin -LRB- West -RRB- &apos; &apos; , whereas the East German government commonly referred to it as `` Westberlin &apos; &apos; ; it began to use `` Berlin -LRB- West -RRB- &apos; &apos; only in the late 1980s .
Travelling to and from West Berlin by road or train always required passing through East German border checks , since West Berlin was an enclave surrounded by East Germany and East Berlin .
Many people lived in one half of the city and had family , friends , and jobs in the other .
West Berlin was a political exclave that existed between 1949 and 1990 .
According to the legal theory followed by the Western Allies , the occupation of most of Germany ended in 1949 with the declaration of the Federal Republic of Germany -LRB- 23 May 1949 -RRB- and the German Democratic Republic -LRB- 7 October 1949 -RRB- .
The Four Power Agreement on Berlin -LRB- September 1971 -RRB- and the Transit Agreement -LRB- May 1972 -RRB- helped to slightly ease tensions over the status of West Berlin . While many restrictions remained in place , it also made it easier for West Berliners to travel to East Germany and it simplified the regulations for Germans traveling along the autobahn transit routes .
Mohamed Kallon -LRB- born 6 October 1979 -RRB- is a Sierra Leonean international footballer and arguably the most famous footballer from Sierra Leone .

`` Good Morning Good Morning &apos; &apos; is a song composed by John Lennon -LRB- credited to Lennon \ / McCartney -RRB- and performed by The Beatles on the 1967 Sgt. Pepper &apos; s Lonely Hearts Club Band album .
At Lennon &apos; s request , George Martin brought in Sounds Incorporated to play the brass section with their signature saxophone sound .
The final sound effect of a chicken clucking was so placed that it transforms into the guitar on the following track , `` Sgt. Pepper &apos; s Lonely Hearts Club Band -LRB- Reprise -RRB- &apos; &apos; .
The jingle went : `` Good morning , good morning , The best to you each morning , Sunshine Breakfast , Kellogg &apos; s Corn Flakes , Crisp and full of fun &apos; &apos; .
In the mono version , the length is 2 : 35 , whereas in the stereo version , the length is 2 : 41 because there are more animal noises .
Lennon asked engineer Geoff Emerick to arrange the animal noises heard at beginning as well as the end of the song so that the animal heard was one capable of devouring or frightening the animal that came before it . .
Inspiration for the song came to Lennon from a television commercial for Kellogg &apos; s Corn Flakes .
The guitar solo was played by Paul McCartney .
The track was recorded on 8 February 1967 , with overdubs on 16 February -LRB- bass and vocals -RRB- , 13 March -LRB- brass section -RRB- , 28 March -LRB- backing vocals and guitar solo -RRB- , and 29 March -LRB- animal noises -RRB- .

Vitamin C is produced from glucose by two main routes .
In animals , these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries .
The Reichstein process , developed in the 1930s , uses a single pre-fermentation followed by a purely chemical route .
Between 1933 and 1934 , not only Haworth and fellow British chemist -LRB- later Sir -RRB- Edmund Hirst had synthesized vitamin C , but also , independently , the Polish chemist Tadeus Reichstein , succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin in bulk , making it the first vitamin to be artificially produced .
Both processes yield approximately 60 % vitamin C from the glucose feed .
The modern two-step fermentation process , originally developed in China in the 1960s , uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages .
While plants are generally a good source of vitamin C , the amount in foods of plant origin depends on the precise variety of the plant , soil condition , climate where it grew , length of time since it was picked , storage conditions , and method of preparation .
It is also a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions , including several collagen synthesis reactions that cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy when they are dysfunctional .

One foam-rubber process has been coined as Foamation by Will Vinton .
The portmanteau term `` Claymation &apos; &apos; is a registered trademark in the United States , registered by Will Vinton in 1978 to describe his clay-animated films .
Each frame , or still picture , is recorded on film or digital media and then played back in rapid succession .
As in other forms of object animation , the object is arranged on the set -LRB- background -RRB- , a film frame is exposed , and the object or character is then moved slightly by hand .
Clay animation is one of many forms of stop motion animation .
All traditional animation is produced in a similar fashion , whether done through cel animation or stop motion .
For feature-length productions , the use of clay has generally been supplanted by rubber silicone and resin-cast components .
For a 30-minute movie , there would be approximately 21,600 stops to change the figures for the frames .
When played back at a frame rate greater than 10 â `` 12 frames per second , a fairly convincing illusion of continuous motion is achieved .
Producing a stop-motion animation using clay is extremely laborious .
Each animated piece , either character or background , is `` deformable &apos; &apos; -- made of a malleable substance , usually Plasticine clay .
With the standard practice of `` doubles &apos; &apos; or `` twos &apos; &apos; -LRB- double-framing , exposing 2 frames for each shot -RRB- , 12 changes are usually made for one second of film movement .
In clay animation , each object is sculpted in clay or a similarly pliable material such as Plasticine , usually around a wire skeleton called an armature .
Normal film runs at 24 frames per second -LRB- frame \ / s -RRB- .
For a full-length -LRB- 90-minute -RRB- movie , there would be approximately 64,800 stops , and possibly far more if parts were shot with `` singles &apos; &apos; or `` ones &apos; &apos; -LRB- one frame exposed for each shot -RRB- .
Another frame is taken , and the object is moved slightly again .

The trip to Mexico was for Eisenstein to make a film produced by Sinclair and his wife , Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair , and three other investors organized as the `` Mexican Film Trust &apos; &apos; .
He accepted a short-term contract for $ 100,000 and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930 .
But it was mostly his international critical renown which enabled Eisenstein to direct October -LRB- aka Ten Days That Shook The World -RRB- as part of a grand tenth anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917 , and then The General Line -LRB- aka Old and New -RRB- .
The thing which appeared to save Eisenstein &apos; s career at this point was that Stalin ended up taking the position that the Bezhin Meadow catastrophe , along with several other problems facing the industry at that point , had less to do with Eisenstein &apos; s approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him .
Many of his theoretical articles from this period , such as Eisenstein on Disney , have surfaced decades later as seminal scholarly texts used as curriculum in film schools around the world .
By December 4 , 1930 , Eisenstein was en route to Mexico by train , accompanied by Alexandrov and Tisse .
Eisenstein was thence able to ingratiate himself with Stalin for ` one more chance &apos; , and he chose , from two offerings , the assignment of a biopic of Alexander Nevsky , with music composed by Sergei Prokofiev .
Julia left Riga the year of the 1905 Revolution , bringing Sergei with her to St. Petersburg .
Eisenstein was a pioneer in the use of montage , a specific use of film editing .
Eisenstein was thus faced with returning home a failure .
Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative â &apos; &apos; at the Sinclairs &apos; expense â &apos; &apos; and distribute any resulting product .
Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein -LRB- ; January 23 , 1898 â `` February 11 , 1948 -RRB- was a pioneering Soviet Russian film director and film theorist , often considered to be the `` Father of Montage . &apos; &apos;
He and his contemporary , Lev Kuleshov , two of the earliest film theorists , argued that montage was the essence of the cinema .
Ultimately this came down on the shoulders of Boris Shumyatsky , `` executive producer &apos; &apos; of Soviet film since 1932 , who in early 1938 was denounced , arrested , tried and convicted as a traitor , and shot .
-LRB- The production executive at Film studio Mosfilm , where Meadow was being made , was also replaced , but without further executions . -RRB-
He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow .
Eisenstein &apos; s father Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein was of German-Jewish and Swedish descent and his mother , Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya , was from a Russian Orthodox family .
Another hypothetical was the staging of the Haitian struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov &apos; s The Black Consul , influenced as well by John Vandercook &apos; s Black Majesty .
In 1918 Sergei joined the Red Army with his father Mikhail supporting the opposite side .
This brought his father to Germany after defeat , and Sergei to Petrograd , Vologda , and Dvinsk .
Eisenstein returned to teaching and was assigned to direct Richard Wagner &apos; s Die WalkÃ 1 \ / 4 re at the Bolshoi Theatre .
Within months of its release , the Stalin entered into a pact with Hitler , and Nevsky was promptly pulled from distribution .
His father was an architect and his mother was the daughter of a prosperous merchant .
With the war approaching Moscow , Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to Alma-Ata , where he first considered the idea of making a film about Czar Ivan IV .
Prokofiev composed the score for Eisenstein &apos; s film and Eisenstein reciprocated by designing sets for an operatic rendition of War and Peace that Prokofiev was developing .
At school with his fellow students however , Sergei would join the military to serve the revolution , which would divide him from his father .
Paramount then proposed a movie version of Theodore Dreiser &apos; s An American Tragedy .
Eisenstein would then work as a designer for Vsevolod Meyerhold .
Eisenstein corresponded with Prokofiev from Alma Ata , and was joined by him there in 1942 .
Eisenstein taught film-making during his career at GIK where he wrote the curricula for the directors &apos; course ; his classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir NizhniÄ &apos; s Lessons with Eisenstein .
Later he produced a brief synopsis of the six-part film which would come , in one form or another , to be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project .
He is noted in particular for his silent films Strike -LRB- 1924 -RRB- , Battleship Potemkin -LRB- 1925 -RRB- and October -LRB- 1927 -RRB- , as well as the historical epics Alexander Nevsky -LRB- 1938 -RRB- and Ivan the Terrible -LRB- 1944 , 1958 -RRB- .
The title for the project , Â Que viva MÃ xico !
Eisenstein &apos; s re-entry visa had expired , and Sinclair &apos; s contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension .
This time , however , he was also assigned a co-scenarist , Pyotr Pavlenko , to bring in a completed script ; professional actors to play the roles ; and an assistant director , Dmitri Vasilyev , to expedite shooting .
Eisenstein admired these artists as much as Mexican culture in general , and they inspired Eisenstein to call his films `` moving frescoes . &apos; &apos;
Eisenstein &apos; s film , Ivan The Terrible , Part I , presenting Ivan IV of Russia as a national hero , won Joseph Stalin &apos; s approval -LRB- and a Stalin Prize -RRB- , but the sequel , Ivan The Terrible , Part II was criticized by various authorities and would go unreleased until 1958 .
In 1920 , Sergei was transferred to a command position in Minsk , after success providing propaganda for the October Revolution .
He used stock characters , and the roles were filled with untrained people from the appropriate classes ; he avoided casting stars .
His narratives eschewed individual characters and addressed broad social issues , especially class conflict .
Eisenstein was born in Riga , Latvia but his family moved frequently in his early years , as Eisenstein continued to do throughout his life .
In his initial films , Eisenstein did not use professional actors .
Like many Bolshevik artists , Eisenstein envisioned a new society which would subsidize artists totally , freeing them from the confines of bosses and budgets , leaving them absolutely free to create , but budgets and producers were as significant to the Soviet film industry as the rest of the world .
The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him and his films , techniques , and theories were becoming increasingly attacked as ` ideological failures &apos; and prime examples of formalism .
He would publicly maintain that he had lost all interest in the project .
Eisenstein felt the `` collision &apos; &apos; of shots could be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience and create film metaphors .
In mid-1932 , the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of Sol Lesser , who had just opened his distribution office in New York , Principal Distributing Corporation .
Eisenstein &apos; s vision of communism brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling regime of Joseph Stalin .
In 1920 Eisenstein moved to Moscow , and began his career in theater working for Proletkult .
In the autumn of 1928 , with October still under fire in many Soviet quarters , Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe , accompanied by his perennial film collaborator Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse .
He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in Kislovodsk in July 1933 , ostensibly a result of depression born of his final acceptance that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage , turned over by Sinclair to Hollywood editors , who would irreparably alter the negatives .
On October 23 , 1930 , by `` mutual consent , &apos; &apos; Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract null and void , and the Eisenstein party were treated to return tickets to Moscow at Paramount &apos; s expense .
Sergei would return at times to see his father , who later moved to join them around 1910 .
The fledgling war - and revolution-wracked and isolated new nation did not have the resources to nationalize its film industry at first .
Officially , the trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and company to learn about sound motion pictures and to present the famous Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West .
Two short feature films and a short subject â &apos; &apos; Thunder Over Mexico based on the `` Maguey &apos; &apos; footage , Eisenstein in Mexico , and Death Day respectively â &apos; &apos; were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934 .
His articles and books â &apos; &apos; particularly Film Form and The Film Sense â &apos; &apos; explain the significance of montage in detail .
, was decided on some time later still .
Eisenstein married filmmaker and writer Pera Atasheva -LRB- 1900 â `` 65 -RRB- in 1934 and remained married until his death in 1948 , though there is some speculation about his sexuality .
Eisenstein proposed a biography of munitions tycoon Sir Basil Zaharoff and a film version of Arms and the Man by George Bernard Shaw , and more fully developed plans for a film of Sutter &apos; s Gold by Jack London , but on all accounts failed to impress the studio &apos; s producers .
It was an obvious allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany , well played and well made .
Strike -LRB- 1925 -RRB- was Eisenstein &apos; s first full-length feature film .
He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin , Zurich , London , and Paris .
Pease , an anti-communist , mounted a public campaign against Eisenstein .
In 1923 Eisenstein began his career as a theorist , by writing The Montage of Attractions for LEF .
Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin , so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way .
The Battleship Potemkin -LRB- 1925 -RRB- was acclaimed critically worldwide .
Eisenstein &apos; s pedagogy , like his films , were politically charged and contained quotes from Vladimir Lenin interwoven with his teaching .
All footage from the still incomplete Ivan The Terrible : Part III was confiscated , and most of it was destroyed -LRB- though several filmed scenes still exist today -RRB- .
Eisenstein toured the American South , on his way to New York .
Further to the didactics of literary and dramatic content , Eisenstein taught the technicalities of directing , photography , and editing , while encouraging his students &apos; development of individuality , expressiveness , and creativity .
Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films , nor a later effort by his first biographer , Marie Seton , called Time in the Sun .
In 1935 , he began another project , Bezhin Meadow , but it appears the film was afflicted with many of the same problems as Que Viva Mexicoâ &apos; &apos; Eisenstein unilaterally decided to film two versions of the scenario , one for adult viewers and one for children ; failed to define a clear shooting schedule ; and shot film prodigiously , resulting in cost overruns and missed deadlines .
Eisenstein &apos; s first film , Glumov &apos; s Diary -LRB- for the theater production Wiseman -RRB- , was also made in that same year with Dziga Vertov hired initially as an `` instructor . &apos; &apos;
This was started , completed , and placed in distribution all within the year 1938 , and represented not only Eisenstein &apos; s first film in nearly a decade but also his first sound film .
At the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering , Sergei studied architecture and engineering , the profession of his father .
On November 24 , Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust `` upon the basis of Eisenstein &apos; s desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be , and in full faith in Eisenstein &apos; s artistic integrity . &apos; &apos;
The two had mutual admiration and between the end of October 1930 , and Thanksgiving of that year , Sinclair had secured an extension of Eisenstein &apos; s absences from the USSR , and permission for him to travel to Mexico .
When it did , limited resources â &apos; &apos; both monetary and equipment â &apos; &apos; required production controls as extensive as in the capitalist world .
Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just expounding a scene or moment , through a `` linkage &apos; &apos; of related images .
In 1929 , in Switzerland , Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by TissÃ entitled Frauennot - FrauenglÃ 1 \ / 4 ck .
The result was a film critically received by both the Soviets and in the West , which won him the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize .
His writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers .
Exercises and examples for students were based on rendering literature such as HonorÃ de Balzac &apos; s Le PÃ re Goriot .
While in Mexico Eisenstein mixed socially with Frida Kahlo , and Diego Rivera .
For Eisenstein , however , it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union .
This excited Eisenstein , who had read and liked the work , and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow .
He developed what he called `` methods of montage &apos; &apos; :
After a prolonged absence , Stalin sent a telegram expressing the concern that Eisenstein had become a deserter .
In late April 1930 , Jesse L. Lasky , on behalf of Paramount Pictures , offered him the opportunity to make a film in the United States .
Eisenstein , Alexandrov , and Tisse were allowed , after a month &apos; s stay at the U.S.-Mexico border outside Laredo , Texas , a 30-day `` pass &apos; &apos; to get from Texas to New York , and thence depart for Moscow , while Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film .
The critics of the outside world praised them , but at home , Eisenstein &apos; s focus in these films on structural issues such as camera angles , crowd movements , and montage brought him and like-minded others , such as Vsevolod Pudovkin and Alexander Dovzhenko , under fire from the Soviet film community , forcing him to issue public articles of self-criticism and commitments to reform his cinematic visions to conform to the increasingly specific doctrines of socialist realism .
The contract also stipulated that the film would be `` non-political , &apos; &apos; that immediately available funding came from Mrs. Sinclair in an amount of `` not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars , &apos; &apos; that the shooting schedule amounted to `` a period of from three to four months , &apos; &apos; and most importantly that `` Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico , all negative film and positive prints , and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture , will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair ... &apos; &apos; A codicil to the contract , dated December 1 , allowed that the `` Soviet Government may have the -LRB- finished -RRB- film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R. &apos; &apos; Reportedly , it was verbally clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hour &apos; s duration .
Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930 , but Paramount disliked it completely and , additionally , found themselves intimidated by Major Frank Pease , president of the Hollywood Technical Director &apos; s Institute .
Eisenstein and his entourage spent considerable time with Charlie Chaplin , who recommended that Eisenstein meet with a sympathetic benefactor in the person of American socialist author Upton Sinclair .
At this time , Sergei studied Japaneseâ &apos; &apos; he learned some three hundred kanji characters which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development , and gained an exposure to Kabuki theater ; these studies led to travel to Japan .
For the unfinished filming of the `` novel &apos; &apos; of Soldadera , without incurring any cost , Eisenstein had secured 500 soldiers , 10,000 guns , and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army , but this was lost due to Sinclair &apos; s canceling of production .
He was subsequently assigned a teaching position with the film school GIK -LRB- now Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography -RRB- where he had taught earlier and in 1933 and 1934 was in charge of writing curriculum .
Eisenstein &apos; s health was also failing : he was struck by a heart attack during the making of this picture , and soon died of another at the age of 50 .
His productions there were entitled Gas Masks , Listen Moscow , and Wiseman .
When Eisenstein arrived at the American border , a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of Jesus caricatures amongst other material of a lewd pornographic nature .
Sinclair &apos; s works had been accepted by and were widely read in the USSR , and were known to Eisenstein .
He was born into a middle-class family .
Under pressure , Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair &apos; s younger brother , Hunter Kimbrough , who had been sent along to act as a line producer , for the film &apos; s problems .

In the first year the plant grows leaves , stems , and roots -LRB- vegetative structures -RRB- , then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months .
True biennials flower only once , while many perennials will flower every year once mature .
From a gardener &apos; s perspective , a plant &apos; s status as annual , biennial , or perennial often varies based on location or purpose .
Under extreme climatic conditions , a biennial plant may complete its life cycle in a very short period of time -LRB- e.g. three or four months instead of two years -RRB- .
Many biennials require a cold treatment , or vernalization , before they will flower .
Biennials grown for flowers , fruits , or seeds need to be grown for two years .
Examples of biennial plants are parsley , Lunaria , silverbeet , Sweet William , colic weed , and carrot .
Flowering can be induced in some biennials without vernalization by application of the plant hormone gibberellin , but this is rarely done commercially .
The plant then flowers , producing fruits and seeds before it finally dies .
This behavior leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas .
Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals , e.g. beets , Brussels sprouts , cabbage , carrots , celery , lettuce , parsley , and Swiss chard .
If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions , it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold .
This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions , or vernalized , before they were planted in the ground .
Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial .
Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed , e.g. foxglove and stock .
A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle .
Conversely , an annual grown under extremely favorable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation , giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial .
Usually the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground , forming a rosette .

Tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents , a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds .
In the mid-latitude westerlies , troughs and ridges often alternate , especially when upper-level winds are in a high-amplitude pattern .

Convective cells may develop in the vicinity of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone .
For a trough in the westerlies , the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air - and hence high pressure - while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast , divergent winds and low pressure .
A trough is an elongated region of relatively low atmospheric pressure , often associated with fronts .

An intron is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing to generate the final mature RNA product of a gene .
Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses , and can be located in a wide range of genes , including those that generate proteins , ribosomal RNA -LRB- rRNA -RRB- , and transfer RNA -LRB- tRNA -RRB- .
The term intron was introduced by American biochemist Walter Gilbert :
Alternative splicing of introns within a gene acts to introduce greater variability of protein sequences translated from a single gene , allowing multiple related proteins to be generated from a single gene and a single precursor mRNA transcript .
The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene , and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts .
When proteins are generated from intron-containing genes , RNA splicing takes place as part of the RNA processing pathway that follows transcription and precedes translation .
Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons .
The discovery of introns led to the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for Phillip Allen Sharp and Richard J. Roberts .
The control of alternative RNA splicing is performed by complex network of signaling molecules that respond to a wide range of intracellular and extracellular signals .

Due to expanding restrictions on work permits restaurants have found it difficult to employ such specialists .
The agreement was absolutely fictional but was neither discovered to be a joke by the Social Democrats during the nightly negotiations nor later by civil servants or the press who went through the coalition contracts .

The terms mud volcano or mud dome are used to refer to formations created by geo-excreted liquids and gases , although there are several different processes which may cause such activity .
Iran and Pakistan also possess mud volcanoes in the Makran range of mountains in the south of the two countries .
The geothermal phenomena known as `` mud volcanoes &apos; &apos; are often not true mud volcanoes -LRB- pelovolcano -RRB- .
Most mud volcanoes in this region are situated in out-of-reach areas having very difficult terrain . Dormant mud volcanoes stand like columns of mud in many other areas .
Approximately 1,100 mud volcanoes have been identified on land and in shallow water .
Many mud volcanoes exist on the shores of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea .
It has been estimated that well over 10,000 may exist on continental slopes and abyssal plains .
Tectonic forces and large sedimentary deposits around the latter have created several fields of mud volcanoes , many of them emitting methane and other hydrocarbons .
Mud volcanoes are often associated with petroleum deposits and tectonic subduction zones and orogenic belts ; hydrocarbon gases are often erupted . They are also often associated with lava volcanoes ; in the case of such close proximity , mud volcanoes emit incombustible gases including helium , whereas lone mud volcanoes are more likely to emit methane .
In 2001 , one mud volcano 15 k from Baku made world headlines when it suddenly started ejecting flames 15 m high .
The largest mud volcano structures are 10 k in diameter and reach 700 m in height .
Depending upon the precise definition of the term mud volcano , the Yellowstone formation could be considered a hydrothermal mud volcano cluster .

Dormant mud volcanoes stand like columns of mud in many other areas .
Mud volcanoes are often associated with petroleum deposits and tectonic subduction zones and orogenic belts ; hydrocarbon gases are often erupted .
In Italy , they are common in the northern front of the Apennines and in Sicily .
A mud volcano may be the result of a piercement structure created by a pressurized mud diapir which breaches the Earth &apos; s surface or ocean bottom .
There are generally few mud volcanoes in Europe , but dozens can be found on the Taman Peninsula of Russia and the Kerch Peninsula of southeastern Ukraine .
They are also often associated with lava volcanoes ; in the case of such close proximity , mud volcanoes emit incombustible gases including helium , whereas lone mud volcanoes are more likely to emit methane .
The name of Yellowstone National Park &apos; s `` Mud Volcano &apos; &apos; feature and the surrounding area is misleading ; it consists of hot springs , mud pots and fumaroles , rather than a true mud volcano .

These long , thin regions resemble a spiral and thus give spiral galaxies their name .
They are mostly found in low-density regions and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters .
A spiral galaxy is a certain kind of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae and , as such , forms part of the Hubble sequence .
Spiral arms are regions of stars that extend from the center of spiral and barred spiral galaxies .
The most convincing evidence for its existence comes from a recent survey , performed by the Spitzer Space Telescope , of stars in the Galactic center .
Our own Milky Way has recently -LRB- in the 1990s -RRB- been confirmed to be a barred spiral , although the bar itself is difficult to observe from our position within the Galactic disk .
Spiral galaxies are named for the -LRB- usually two-armed -RRB- spiral structures that extend from the center into the disk .
Together with irregulars , spiral galaxies make up approximately 60 % of galaxies in the local Universe .

`` Do not the Unbelievers see that the skies -LRB- space -RRB- and the earth were joined together , then We -LRB- Allah -RRB- clove them asunder and We -LRB- Allah -RRB- created every living thing out of the water .
Islamic creationism is the belief that the universe -LRB- including humanity -RRB- was directly created by God as explained in the Qur ` an .
`` On the day when We -LRB- Allah -RRB- will roll up the sky -LRB- space -RRB- like the rolling up of the scroll for writings , as We -LRB- Allah -RRB- originated the first creation , -LRB- so -RRB- We -LRB- Allah -RRB- shall reproduce it ; a promise -LRB- binding on Us -RRB- ; surely We will bring it about . &apos; &apos;

Homosexual behavior in animals refers to the documented evidence of homosexual , bisexual and transgender behavior in non-human animals .
The motivations for and implications of these behaviors have yet to be fully understood , since most species have yet to be fully studied .
Animal sexual behavior takes many different forms , even within the same species .
According to Bagemihl , `` the animal kingdom -LRB- does -RRB- it with much greater sexual diversityâ &apos; &apos; including homosexual , bisexual and nonreproductive sexâ &apos; &apos; than the scientific community and society at large have previously been willing to accept . &apos; &apos;

Although Sturgeon is well-known among readers of classic science-fiction anthologies -LRB- at the height of his popularity in the 1950s he was the most anthologized author alive -RRB- and much respected by critics -LRB- John Clute writes in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction : `` His influence upon writers like Harlan Ellison and Samuel R. Delany was seminal , and in his life and work he was a powerful and generally liberating influence in post-WWII US sf &apos; &apos; -RRB- , he is not much known among the general public and won comparatively few awards -LRB- though it must be noted that his best work was published before the establishment and consolidation of the leading genre awards , while his later production was scarcer and weaker -RRB- .
At first he wrote mainly short stories , primarily for genre magazines such as Astounding and Unknown , but also for general-interest publications such as Argosy Magazine .

Mercury is the innermost and smallest planet in the Solar System , orbiting the Sun once every 87.969 Earth days . The orbit of Mercury has the highest eccentricity of all the Solar System planets , and it has the smallest axial tilt .
Surface temperatures range from about 90 to -LRB- â &apos; 183 Â C to 427 Â C -RRB- , with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the poles being the coldest .
It is an exceptionally dense planet due to the large relative size of its core .
Mercury &apos; s density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g \ / cm3 , only slightly less than Earthâ s density of 5.515 g \ / cm3 .
Before the 4th century BC , Greek astronomers believed the planet to be two separate objects : one visible only at sunrise , which they called Apollo ; the other visible only at sunset , which they called Hermes .
The first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was Mariner 10 , which mapped about 45 % of the planetâ s surface from 1974 to 1975 .
However , unlike the Moon , it has a large iron core , which generates a magnetic field about 1 % as strong as that of the Earth .
Recorded observations of Mercury date back to at least the first millennium BC .
Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System , and is a rocky body like the Earth .
The astronomical symbol for Mercury is a stylized version of Hermes &apos; caduceus .
It is the smallest planet in the Solar System , with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 km .
Since Mercury is normally lost in the glare of the Sun , unless there is a solar eclipse it can be viewed from Earth &apos; s Northern Hemisphere only in morning or evening twilight , while its extreme elongations occur in declinations south of the celestial equator , such that it can be seen at favorable apparitions from moderate latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere in a fully dark sky .
Mercury consists of approximately 70 % metallic and 30 % silicate material .

But , for StarÄ eviÄ , the `` Slavoserb &apos; &apos; were worse than the Jews ; the notion was firstly of a political nature : the `` Slavoserbs &apos; &apos; are his political opponents who `` sold themselves to a foreign rule &apos; &apos; .
StarÄ eviÄ returned to Croatia and continued studying theology in Senj .
As an aged man , he equated Serbs with the `` Slavoserb breed &apos; &apos; and mocked them for defeats they suffered long ago - which provoked negative reactions even within his `` Party of Rights &apos; &apos; .
When Srbski dnevnik from Novi Sad published an article saying that `` Croatians write in Serbian &apos; &apos; , StarÄ eviÄ wrote a fierce reply : Instead of claiming that the Croats use anything else but the Croatian language , those writers who consider themselves Serbs -LRB- or whatever they like -RRB- would do well to write in the educated and pure Croatian language , like some of them are already doing , and they can call their language Coptic for all I care .
To let the Jews to participate in public life is dangerous : throw a piece of mud in a glass of the clearest water - then all the water will be puddled .
In the preface to this edition , Dr. Vladimir Veselica , a Zagreb University professor , expresses his enthusiasm that the author had given `` relevant answers &apos; &apos; at the highest intellectual level .
On that occasion , the Party member Erazmo BarÄ iÄ -LRB- 1894 -RRB- described StarÄ eviÄ &apos; s mockery and racism as `` throwing mud at people and primitive cheeky invectives &apos; &apos; .
In his old age , he moved to StarÄ eviÄ House -LRB- StarÄ eviÄ ev dom -RRB- , built for him by the Croatian people in 1895 .
After passing a number of philosophy and free sciences classes , he earned a honoris causa degree in 1846 .
His translation of Anacreon from Ancient Greek was published in Danica in 1853 .
StarÄ eviÄ &apos; s famous phrase was : `` Ni s BeÄ om ni s PeÅ tom &apos; &apos; -LRB- `` Neither with Vienna nor with Pest &apos; &apos; -RRB- StarÄ eviÄ was the only parliamentary representative who agreed with Kvaternik &apos; s draft constitution of 26 June 1861 .
Rather than becoming a priest , however , he decided to engage in secular pursuits and started working in the law firm of Ladislav Å ram in Zagreb .
According to these two historians , his understanding of basic human rights and the way he linked them to civil liberties were extremely primitive and selective .
He published the reply as an unsigned article in Narodne novine , the newspaper of Ljudevit Gaj , so the Serbian side attacked Gaj , wrongly attributing the article to him .
The Croatian Party of Rights was abolished .
Further , he claimed that the injustice was done to different `` cursed breeds &apos; &apos; which spoiled those breeds even more and made them `` to be vengeful against their oppressors &apos; &apos; .
He pointed out that Croatia needed to determine its relationships with Austria and Hungary through international agreements .
In the foreword , young StarÄ eviÄ elaborated his linguistic ideas , specifically that the mixture of all three Croatian dialects -LRB- Shtokavian , Chakavian and Kajkavian -RRB- and the Krajina dialect , with its 600 year history , was the Croatian language .
That way the Jews spoiled and poisoned the French people too much &apos; &apos; .
He wrote a whole tractate about the Jews that could be summarized in a few sentences : `` Jews ... are the breed , except a few , without any morality and without any homeland , the breed of which every unit strives to its personal gain , or to its relatives &apos; gain .
This was not a popular or widely accepted theory ; educated people headed by Strossmayer and Gaj supported KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ .
His portrait is depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 1000 kuna banknote , issued in 1993 .
According to his wish , he was buried in the Church of St Mirko in the Zagreb suburb of Å estine .
As a convinced racist , he stresses that the `` cursed breeds &apos; &apos; should not be given any role in the public life .
His travelogue From Lika was published in KuÅ lan &apos; s magazine Slavenski Jug on 22 October 1848 .
However , facing negative reactions to his open racism , he temporarily retreated .
He started his studies at the seminary in Senj , but moved to Pest in 1845 in order to attend a Roman Catholic theological seminary from which he graduated in 1848 .
His opposition to KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ &apos; s work was based in utter denial of the Serbs as the nation , their language , their culture and history .
StarÄ eviÄ wrote literary criticism , short stories , newspaper articles , philosophical essays , plays and political satire .
Austria lost control over Italy , and Austria &apos; s weakening status in the world paved the way for StarÄ eviÄ &apos; s career .
While the revolt drew several hundred men , both Croats and Serbs , it was soon crushed by Imperial Austrian troops .
StarÄ eviÄ believed that Bosniaks were `` the best Croats &apos; &apos; , and claimed that `` Bosnian Muslims are a part of the Croatian people and of the purest Croatian blood &apos; &apos; .
While in Paris , he published his work La Croatie et la confÃ dÃ ration italienne , considered by some to be the precursor to his Party of Rights &apos; political program .
He advocated the termination of the Military Frontier and persuaded parliament to pass on 5 August 1861 the decision annulling any joint business with Austria .
In 1862 , when Fiume was implicated in participation in protests against the Austrian Empire , he was suspended and sentenced to one month in prison as an enemy of the regime .
StarÄ eviÄ subsequently proclaimed he was the author , not Gaj , who cared to maintain good relations with Serbia , distanced himself from his friend .
He was also a member of the committee of Matica ilirska , a Croatian cultural society -LRB- see Illyrian movement -RRB- , in the Historical Society and in the editorial board of Neven , a literary magazine .
In later years , StarÄ eviÄ marked the `` Slavoserbs &apos; &apos; as a separate ethnic group , or - as he used to say the `` breed &apos; &apos; , which ranked , as humans , lower than the Jews : `` The Jews are less harmful than the Slavoserbs .
After being banned from practising law in 1857 , StarÄ eviÄ traveled to Russia where he hoped he would gather support from his country &apos; s eastern rival .
When he was released , StarÄ eviÄ returned to Å ram &apos; s office , where he remained until 11 October 1871 , when he was arrested again , this time on the occasion of the Rakovica Revolt .
That was a reason that he wrote an article in Sloboda , issue of March 23 , 1883 : The main thing is this : everybody should work for the people and the homeland , and let them call themselves as they wish ... We have disputes and dissensions only because they are supported and strengthened from the outside ... We believe that hungry and cold Serbs and Croats feel the same ... Therefore , everybody can assume the name of Hottentots , every person can choose their own name , as long as we are all free and happy !
StarÄ eviÄ was born in Å 1 \ / 2 itnik near GospiÄ , a small town in Lika , not far from the Adriatic Sea , in what was then part of Austria-Hungary .
On that ideological basis , he founded the Party of Rights with his school friend Eugen Kvaternik in 1861 .
In 1845 , he graduated from the comprehensive secondary school in Zagreb .
For his political and literary work , StarÄ eviÄ is commonly called Father of the Nation -LRB- Otac domovine -RRB- among Croats , a name first used by Eugen Kvaternik while StarÄ eviÄ was still alive .
In 1850 , inspired by Ljudevit Gaj , StarÄ eviÄ started working on the manuscript of Istarski razvod , a Croatian document from 1325 .
He demanded the reintegration of the Croatian lands , the large kingdom of Croatia of old -LRB- themedieval Kingdom of Croatia -RRB- , the homeland of one people , with the same blood , language , past and -LRB- God willing -RRB- future .
It is sufficient to submit one quotation that explains the sense and content of this book , which far outdoes the current demonization of the Serbs : &apos; &apos; it was not without reason that I tried to show how the Serbs today are dangerous for their ideas and their racial composition , how a bent for conspiracies , revolutions and coups is in their blood . &apos; &apos;
He wrote four plays in the period 1851-52 , but only the Village Prophet has been preserved .
It was demonstrated publicly immediately after KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ &apos; s death - when Croatian Parliament -LRB- Sabor -RRB- collected a considerable amount of money in order to erect a monument to honor KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ in Croatia and the Court chancellor Ivan MaÅ 3 \ / 4 uraniÄ got the Viennese Imperial Court to financially support KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ &apos; s widow .
In that period , in the Call for Subscriptions to the Croatian Grammar -LRB- 8 December 1851 -RRB- he stated his opposition to the Vienna Language Agreement of 1850 and the linguistic concept of Vuk StefanoviÄ KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ .
He was the son of a Croat Catholic father and a Serb Orthodox mother .
The revolt was launched by Kvaternik , who was not a Serb hater as StarÄ eviÄ was and who had become convinced that a political solution of the type StarÄ eviÄ called for was not possible .
About the people and nations which he saw as cursed and lower ranked races - he spoke as of the animal breeds and uses the `` breed &apos; &apos; word to mark them .
The issue of StarÄ eviÄ &apos; s alleged racism was further elaborated by Ivo Pilar , under the pseudonym L. von SÃ 1 \ / 4 dland -RRB- The same book was translated into Croatian in 1943 , by Independent State of Croatia , as one of the tenets of its UstaÅ e . This racist work was reprinted in 1990 in Croatia .
StarÄ eviÄ would be reelected to the parliament in 1865 , 1871 , and from 1878 to his death .
He transcribed the text from the Glagolitic alphabet to the Latin alphabet , analyzed it and published it in 1852 .
That same year , he was elected to the Croatian Parliament as the representative of Fiume and founded the original Croatian Party of Rights with Eugen Kvaternik .
StarÄ eviÄ was released after two months in prison .
He continued his dispute with the followers of KaradÅ 3 \ / 4 iÄ in a series of articles published in 1852 .
Then all those who favorably look on the South Slavs unity not regarding them -LRB- the South Slavs -RRB- as the Croats .
StarÄ eviÄ accepted the etymological orthography and used the ekavian form for his entire life , considering it the heir of the old Kajkavian .
His language is a `` synthetic &apos; &apos; form of Croatian , never used before or after him , most similar to the Ozalj idiom of Petar Zrinski , whom he probably never read .
In 1859 , the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Second Italian War of Independence , during which time StarÄ eviÄ returned to Croatia .
His bust was made by Ivan RendiÄ .
Ante StarÄ eviÄ -LRB- ; 23 May 1823 -- 28 February 1896 -RRB- , often refered as Father of Homeland was a Croatian politician and writer , whose activities and works laid the foundations for the modern Croatian state .
He was also a translator .
According to Croatian-Jewish historians Mirjana Gross and Ivo Goldstein , StarÄ eviÄ was a racist and an anti-Semite .
As the chief notary in Fiume in 1861 , StarÄ eviÄ wrote `` the four petitions of the Rijeka county &apos; &apos; , which are considered the basis of the political program of the Croatian Party of Rights .
- he wrote once .
In 1861 , he was appointed the chief notary of the Fiume -LRB- Rijeka -RRB- county .
On his deathbed , he requested that no monuments be raised to his honor , but his statue was put up in front of StarÄ eviÄ House in 1998 .
As Josip Horvat said : `` His literary work from 1849 to the end of 1853 made Ante StarÄ eviÄ the most prolific and original Croatian writer along with Mirko BogoviÄ . &apos; &apos;
For the Jews care for themselves and their people ... but the Slavoserbs are always for the evil : if they can not gain a benefit , then they tend to harm the good or just affair , or to harm those who are for the affair . &apos; &apos;
He advocated the resolution of Bosnian issues by reforms and cooperation between the people and the nobility .
His opus shows an affinity with practical philosophy , which he calls `` the science of life &apos; &apos; .
For example , StarÄ eviÄ criticized socialism as `` unshaped &apos; &apos; and was delighted by the colonialism and claimed that `` Algeria should be densely populated by a few million happy Frenchmen and not to allow to have one hundred fifty thousand of them against two and half million of Arabs &apos; &apos; .
He then tried to get an academic post with the University of Zagreb , but was unsuccessful , so he remained in Å ram &apos; s office until 1861 even though he was banned from practicing law in 1857 .
His critical review -LRB- 1855 -RRB- of Ä urÄ ` eviÄ &apos; s Pjesni razlike was described by the Croatian literary historian Branko Vodnik as `` our first genuine literary essay about older Dubrovnik literature &apos; &apos; .
StarÄ eviÄ based his ideological views on writings of ancient Greek writers who thought that some people , by their very nature , are slaves , for they had `` just half of the human mind &apos; &apos; and , for that reason , they `` shall be governed by people of the human nature &apos; &apos; .
When this failed , he traveled to France , pinning his hopes on French emperor Napoleon III .
He died in his house a year later , when he was 73 .

Some templates have their documentation on a separate \ / doc page , and then show that documentation in a green doc box below the template code by using the template .
-LRB- Although most users remove the sandbox notice when they copy the code from the \ / sandbox to the main template .
See more below . -RRB-
-LRB- See also Protection policy . -RRB-
Provided there is only one sandbox or testcases page in use for the particular main page , another option is to move the sandbox page to the standard &apos; &apos; \ / sandbox &apos; &apos; name , or testcases to &apos; &apos; \ / testcases &apos; &apos; .
If you do n &apos;t want a page to be categorised then use the template like this :
If you want to demonstrate the template on say Template messages \ / Template namespace then you need to feed the subpage-name to make it show and feed an empty category parameter so it does n &apos;t categorise the page .
To learn more about how to use template \ / sandbox and \ / testcases subpages see Template test cases .
It also detects when it is not on a \ / sandbox page and then shows nothing , thus it can be left in the code when copied and pasted to the main template .
If the \ / sandbox page has another name , for instance &apos; &apos; \ / sandbag &apos; &apos; , then you need to tell the sandbox notice the name of the page , so that it knows when to show and when not to show itself .
The notice-not-sandbox parameter can for instance be used so a protection template can be placed already in the \ / sandbox version of the code .
-LRB- See also Protection policy and Template documentation . -RRB-
Then place the sandbox notice like this :
This example handles both a protection template and a green doc box from a \ / doc page at the same time .
That may be preferable since other templates and tools also assume that the sandbox uses that name , such as .
This template categorises \ / sandbox pages into : Category : Template sandboxes .

Any blank space or newlines between the template code and the tag can cause the template to render unwanted spaces or newlines when used .
It can be placed on template \ / sandbox pages .
But beware , if the notice-not-sandbox parameter has been used then the sandbox notice must be copied with the rest of the template code .

Currently , WWE has the WrestleMania Revenge tour , after WrestleMania , at the beginning of the year and the Survivor Series tour , at the end of the year , in the UK .
In the United Kingdom and Ireland , some pay-per-views are shown on Sky Sports 1 and others on Sky Box Office .
Each includes a Raw and SmackDown taping .
This article lists pay-per-view events promoted by World Wrestling Entertainment -LRB- WWE -RRB- . WWE holds one pay-per-view event per month , except in the month of October , when it holds two .
The first SummerSlam was held in Madison Square Garden in August 1988 .
The only exceptions to the pay-per-view split were the `` Big Four &apos; &apos; events -LRB- Royal Rumble , WrestleMania , SummerSlam and Survivor Series -RRB- which remained inclusive of all WWE brands .
The first two WrestleManias were financial successes , and after WrestleMania III became a popular event in wrestling history , the WWF then decided to expand their pay-per-view offerings .
Initially , the WWF used the In Your House brand , but beginning in 1996 began using other names to complement the In Your House name -LRB- such as Bad Blood and No Way Out -RRB- , to avoid confusion .

The Snowball Earth hypothesis has been invoked to explain glacial deposits in the Huronian Supergroup of Canada , though the palaeomagnetic evidence that suggests ice sheets at low latitudes is contested .
It was certainly less significant than the Sturtian or Marinoan glaciations , and probably not global in extent .
Even the leading Snowball proponent Hoffman agrees that the ~ million year long Gaskiers glaciation did not lead to global glaciation , although it was probably as intense as the late Ordovician glaciation .
The Snowball Earth hypothesis posits that the Earth &apos; s surface became entirely or nearly entirely frozen at least once , some time earlier than 650 million years ago .
The status of the Kaigas `` glaciation &apos; &apos; or `` cooling event &apos; &apos; is currently unclear ; some workers do not recognize it as a glacial , others suspect that it may reflect poorly dated strata of Sturtian association , and others believe it may indeed be a third ice age .
It has been proposed that rise of free oxygen that occurred during this part of the Paleoproterozoic removed methane in the atmosphere through oxidation .
The glacial sediments of the Makganyene formation of South Africa are slightly younger than the Huronian glacial deposits -LRB- ~ 2.25 billion years old -RRB- and were deposited at tropical latitudes .
Emerging evidence suggests that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic , which would stand strongly at odds with the Snowball hypothesis .
Opponents to the hypothesis contested the implications of the geological evidence for global glaciation , the geophysical feasibility of an ice - or slush-covered ocean , and the difficulty of escaping an all-frozen condition .
Of these , the Marinoan was the most significant , and the Sturtian glaciations were also truly widespread .
As the Sun was notably weaker at the time , the Earth &apos; s climate may have relied on methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , to maintain surface temperatures above freezing .
There are three or four significant ice ages during the late Neoproterozoic .
The geological community generally accepts this hypothesis because it best explains sedimentary deposits generally regarded as of glacial origin at tropical paleolatitudes and other otherwise enigmatic features in the geological record .
In the absence of this methane greenhouse , temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred .

Some Orthodox churches have adopted the Revised Julian calendar for the observance of fixed feasts , while other Orthodox churches retain the Julian calendar for all purposes . The Julian calendar is still used by the Berber people of North Africa , and on Mount Athos .
It was chosen after consultation with the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria and was probably designed to approximate the tropical year -LRB- known at least since Hipparchus -RRB- .
The Julian calendar remained in use into the 20th century in some countries as a civil calendar , but has been replaced by the Gregorian calendar in nearly all countries .
Although all Eastern Orthodox countries -LRB- most of them in Eastern or Southeastern Europe -RRB- had adopted the Gregorian calendar -LRB- or in the case of Greece , possibly the Revised Julian calendar -RRB- by 1927 , their national churches had not .
The Julian calendar began in 45 BC -LRB- 709 AUC -RRB- as a reform of the Roman calendar by Julius Caesar .
The Julian calendar has a regular year of 365 days divided into 12 months with a leap day added to February every four years . The Julian year is , therefore , on average 365.25 days long .

While French and allied forces were able to occupy Prussian and Hanoveranian territories up to East Frisia , French ambitions to invade Britain and to continue with their guerre de course were thwarted by a British naval blockade , which also impaired French supply routes to the colonies .
The war ended with the peace treaties of Paris -LRB- Bourbon France and Spain , Great Britain -RRB- and of Hubertusburg -LRB- Hohenzollerns , Habsburgs , Saxon elector -RRB- in 1763 .
The native American tribes were excluded from the peace settlement , and were unable to return to their former status after the resulting Pontiac &apos; s rebellion .
William Pitt &apos; s saying that `` America was won in Germany &apos; &apos; referred to the Prussian war effort , which enabled Great Britain to keep her continental commitment limited and focus on her `` blue water policy , &apos; &apos; successfully establishing naval supremacy .
Frederick however recovered , regained ground and managed to avoid any concessions in Hubertusburg , where the status quo ante bellum was restored .
Spain &apos; s short intervention resulted in the loss of Florida , though she gained French Louisiana west of the Mississippi in exchange and Britain returned Cuba as well as the Philippines .
In the historiography of some countries , the war is alternatively named after respective theaters : French and Indian War -LRB- USA , 1754 â `` 1763 -RRB- , Pomeranian War -LRB- Sweden , 1757 â `` 1762 -RRB- , Third Carnatic War -LRB- India , 1757 â `` 1763 -RRB- and Third Silesian War -LRB- Prussia and Austria , 1756 â `` 1763 -RRB- .
The Russian Empire left its offensive alliance with the Habsburgs on the succession of Peter III , and like Sweden concluded a separate peace with Prussia in 1762 .
The Seven Years &apos; War was a global military conflict between 1756 and 1763 , involving most of the great powers of the time affecting North and Central America , Europe , the West African coast , India and the Philippines .
The involvement of Portugal , Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers .
The war was driven by the antagonism between the British Empire -LRB- in personal union with Hanover -RRB- and the Bourbons -LRB- in France and Spain -RRB- , resulting from overlapping interests in their colonial and trade empires , and by the antagonism between the Hohenzollerns -LRB- in Prussia -RRB- and Habsburgs -LRB- Holy Roman Emperors and archdukes in Austria -RRB- , resulting from territorial and hegemonial conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire .
The diplomatic revolution established an Anglo-Prussian camp , allied with some smaller German states and later Portugal , as well as an Austro-French camp , allied with Sweden , Saxony and later Spain .
In Europe , Frederick II of Prussia failed to complete a preemptive strike against Austria , and his numerically superior opponents repulsed and at Kunersdorf nearly annilihated his forces .
Great Britain excelled her Bourbon rivals in the contested overseas territories , gaining the bulk of New France , Spanish Florida , some Caribbean islands , Senegal and superiority over the French outposts on the Indian subcontinent .
The war was characterized by sieges and arson of towns as well as open battles involving extremely heavy losses ; overall , some 900,000 to 1,400,000 people died .

Three Southampton trams have survived .
The last tram to pass through the central archway did so on 4 June 1938 , by which time part of Southampton ancient walls had been demolished so that the Bargate was passable on both sides .
Despite the clever design , the roadway through the arch in the Bargate still had to be lowered and some secretive fine-tuning of the profile of the arch masonry was also required at the last minute .
By 1887 , the company was on a sound financial footing , and paying dividends of 8 % per annum to its shareholders .
Southampton Corporation Tramways were in operation from 1879 to 1949 .
In 1923 a new design of enclosed double deck tram was introduced by P.J Baker , General Manager of the tramways , with a rounded top that would fit through the arch .
These trams had smaller wheels to help reduce the overall height and were driven by high speed motors producing more torque .
After closure , some dome-topped trams were sold to Leeds , but the majority were sent to A F Harris &apos; s scrapyard at Bevois Valley for scrapping .
The first route opened was Stag Gates â `` Holy Rood , with approval to operate Alma Road â `` Canute Road â `` Oxford Street â `` High Street â `` Floating Dock and Stag Gates â `` Lodge Road â `` Portswood being received on 6 May 1879 .
They were initially horse-drawn , but latterly powered by electricity .
Services began on 5 May 1879 , with takings of Â # 26 on that day .
The first horse-drawn omnibus service in the town started about the time the railway arrived , and by 1843 one Thomas Matcham was running a regular service from the station to Millbrook , Eling , Bitterne , Shirley , Portswood , Totton and Romsey .
Southampton Tramways were mainly affected by staffing issues during World War I. With the introduction of female `` conductorettes &apos; &apos; .
Car no . 31 was destroyed by an incendiary bomb on 30 November 1940 , the only loss of the war .
Tram No. 2 , which had been converted to a toastrack in 1916 , had a central gangway cut through for the benefit of the ladies .
Floating Bridge - Shirley , Holy Rood - High Street - Royal Pier and Roberts Road - Millbrook all closed on 31 December 1949 .
Trams started to pass around the East of the Bargate on 24 April 1932 .
To save the fleet of trams from the intensive bombing of Southampton during World War II , they were painted gray , regular services ceased at 7pm and they were parked up overnight in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common .
In the early years of the war , a tram went round Southampton for two hours twice a week , with a military band playing on the top deck , in an effort to boost recruitment .
The Southampton Tramway Company was compulsorily purchased by Southampton Corporation on 30 June 1898 , at a price of Â # 51,000 .
Swaythling - Burgess Road - Bassett Crossroads - Avenue Junction closed on 5 March 1949 .
It was decided that buses were a better alternative .
Prior to 1932 , the only road route between Southampton High Street and Above Bar was through the arch in the center of the Bargate .
From 22 October 1889 , the Portswood route operated via Spear Road and Avenue Road .
That incident caused some consternation locally , as saboteurs were thought to be responsible .
Various objection were raised to this scheme , and the Corporation refused to allow tram lines to be laid in the High Street and Above Bar .
Four new trams and forty more horses were required to operate this service .
By 1876 , the Corporation realized that Southampton was falling behind other places in regards to the provision of public transport .
With the coming of the railway in 1839 and the development of the docks , Southampton grew from a population of 27,000 in 1841 to 42,000 in 1861 .
Again women were employed , but this time they were allowed to drive the trams too .
The Southampton Tramways Company was formed to build a new tramway system .
Construction began in the summer of 1878 .
There was opposition to the running of trams on Sundays , and a petition of 3,500 signatures was raised against this practice .
Southampton was a growing town in the nineteenth century .
A few were sold on from there to be used as sheds or summer houses , which enabled the preservation of three vehicles .
The unmanned convoy of trams was stopped by a lorry before anybody was hurt .
Swaythling - Portswood - Lodge Road - Stag Gates closed on 30 October 1948 .
It later emerged that the incident was due to a young boy playing on the trams .
World War II affected Southampton much more than World War One .
Tramway Junction â `` Commercial Road â `` Shirley opened on 9 June 1879 .
The last movement of a tram in Southampton was on 4 February 1950 when cars No. 21 and No. 101 were moved from Shirley depot to Portswood depot under their own power .
In November 1942 , a tram was accidentally set in motion whilst parked up overnight , taking two others with it .
In 1896 , fares were reduced from 3d to 2d for the through routes , and frequency doubled to 5 minute intervals from Stag Gates to Holy Rood .
By 1872 , tramways were becoming fashionable and the British and Foreign Tramway Company approached Southampton Corporation with a view to setting up a tramway in the town .
The first line to close was Bitterne Park - St. Mary &apos; s - Docks , which closed on 15 May 1948 .

Current projections show a steady decline in the population growth rate , with the population expected to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the year 2040 and 2050 .
The term often refers to the relationship between the human population and its environment , the Earth .
The scientific consensus is that the current population expansion and accompanying increase in usage of resources is linked to threats to the ecosystem .
The recent rapid increase in human population over the past two centuries has raised concerns that humans are beginning to overpopulate the Earth , and that the planet may not be able to sustain present or larger numbers of inhabitants .
The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth , which was ratified by 58 member national academies in 1994 , called the growth in human numbers `` unprecedented &apos; &apos; , and stated that many environmental problems , such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , global warming , and pollution , were aggravated by the population expansion .
Steve Jones , head of the biology department at University College London , has said , `` Humans are 10,000 times more common than we should be , according to the rules of the animal kingdom , and we have agriculture to thank for that .
The population has been growing continuously since the end of the Black Death , around the year 1400 ; at the beginning of the 19th century , it had reached roughly 1,000,000,000 -LRB- 1 billion -RRB- .
Overpopulation is a condition where an organism &apos; s numbers exceed the carrying capacity of its habitat .
Without farming , the world population would probably have reached half a million by now . &apos; &apos;
At the time , the world population stood at 5.5 billion , and low-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050 , a number that current estimates show will be reached around 2022 .

On the other hand , a significant number participated in anti-Nazi movements such as the French resistance .
Many white Ã migrÃ s also believed it was their duty to remain active in combat against the Soviet dictatorship , with the hopes of liberating Russia .
After the war , active anti-Soviet combat was almost exclusively continued by NTS : other organizations either dissolved , or began concentrating exclusively on self-preservation and \ / or educating the youth .
Berlin and Paris developed thriving Ã migrÃ communities .
These people formed organizations such as the Mladorossi , the Evraziitsi , and the Smenovekhovtsi .

Various youth organizations , such as the Russian scouts in exile became functional in raising children with a background in pre-Soviet Russian culture and heritage .
The Ã migrÃ s formed various organizations for the purpose of combatting the Soviet regime such as the Russian All-Military Union , the Brotherhood of Russian Truth , and the NTS .
They spanned all classes and included military soldiers and officers , Cossacks , intellectuals of various professions , dispossessed businessmen and landowners , as well as officials of the Russian Imperial Government and various anti-Bolshevik governments of the Russian Civil War period .
During the war , the white Ã migrÃ s came into contact with former Soviet citizens from German-occupied territories who used the German retreat as an opportunity to flee from the Soviet Union or were in Germany and Austria as POWs and forced labourers and preferred to stay in the West , often referred to as the second wave of emigres -LRB- often also called DPs - displaced persons , see Displaced persons camp -RRB- .
During and after World War II many Russian Ã migrÃ s moved to the United Kingdom , the United States , Canada , Peru , Brazil , Argentina , and Australia where many of their communities still exist today .

During World War II , many white Ã migrÃ s took part in the Russian Liberation Movement .
`` There will be an hour - believe it - there will be , when the liberated Russia will ask each of us : `` What have you done to accelerate my rebirth . &apos; &apos;
White Ã migrÃ s were generally speaking anticommunist and did not consider the Soviet Union and its legacy to be Russian at its core .

Although he won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology , Tonegawa is a molecular biologist by training .
Tonegawa is best known for elucidating the genetic mechanism in the adaptive immune system .
Susumu Tonegawa -LRB- å æ å é Tonegawa Susumu , born September 6 , 1939 -RRB- is a Japanese scientist who won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1987 for his discovery of the genetic mechanism that produces antibody diversity .
In his later years , he has turned his attention to the molecular and cellular basis of memory formation .
Instead , as Tonegawa showed in a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976 , genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies .
Comparing the DNA of B cells -LRB- a type of white blood cell -RRB- in embryonic and adult mice , he observed that genes in the mature B cells of the adult mice are moved around , recombined , and deleted to form the diversity of the variable region of antibodies .
To achieve the diversity of antibodies needed to protect against any type of antigen , the immune system would require millions of genes coding for different antibodies , if each antibody was encoded by one gene .

There are many different methods of strength training , the most common being the use of gravity or elastic \ / hydraulic forces to oppose muscle contraction . See the resistance training article for information about elastic \ / hydraulic training , but note that the terms `` strength training &apos; &apos; and `` resistance training &apos; &apos; are often used interchangeably .
Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity , although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of aerobic exercise through circuit training .
When properly performed , strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being , including increased bone , muscle , tendon and ligament strength and toughness , improved joint function , reduced potential for injury , increased bone density , a temporary increase in metabolism , improved cardiac function , and elevated HDL -LRB- good -RRB- cholesterol .
Strength training differs from bodybuilding , weightlifting , powerlifting , and strongman , which are sports rather than forms of exercise , although training for them is inherently interconnected with strength training , as it is for shotput , discus , and Highland games .
The specific combinations of reps , sets , exercises , resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the exercise : sets with fewer reps can be performed using more force , but have a reduced impact on endurance .
Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen , notably football , rugby , lacrosse , basketball , hockey , and track and field .
Strength training is the use of resistance to muscular contraction to build the strength , anaerobic endurance , and size of skeletal muscles .
Until the 20th century , the history of strength training was very similar to the history of weight training .
See the resistance training article for information about elastic \ / hydraulic training , but note that the terms `` strength training &apos; &apos; and `` resistance training &apos; &apos; are often used interchangeably .
The basic principles of strength training involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions -LRB- reps -RRB- , sets , tempo , exercises and force to cause desired changes in strength , endurance , size or shape by overloading of a group of muscles .
Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental increases of weight , elastic tension or other resistance , and uses a variety of exercises and types of equipment to target specific muscle groups .

Tamamo-no-Mae was not only beautiful , but she was infinitely knowledgeable in all subjects .
Tamamo-no-Mae &apos; s spirit became Hoji and haunted the stone .
After eluding the hunters for some time , the fox appeared to Miura-no-suke in a dream .
In the OtogizÅ shi , a collection of Japanese prose written in the Muromachi period , Tamamo-no-Mae was a courtesan under the Japanese Emperor Konoe -LRB- who reigned from 1142 through 1155 -RRB- .
He went to many priests and fortune-tellers for answers , but they had none to offer .
She was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman in Japan .
After some time had passed , with Konoe all the while lavishing all his affection on the beautiful Tamamo-no-Mae , the Emperor suddenly and mysteriously fell ill . .
Hoji is said to have haunted this stone in the Japanese prefecture of Nasu until a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by Hoji .
Miura-no-suke refused .
Tamamo-no-Mae &apos; s body mysteriously always smelled wonderful , and her clothes never became wrinkled or dirty .
Although she appeared to be only twenty years old , there was no question that she could not answer .
Tamamo-no-Mae -LRB- ç è -- &apos; &apos; å , ç è -- &apos; &apos; ã å , also ç è -- &apos; &apos; å 3 \ / 4 å -RRB- is a legendary figure in Japanese mythology .
Because of her beauty and intelligence , everyone in the Imperial Court adored her , and Emperor Konoe fell deeply in love with her .
Tamamo-no-Mae &apos; s legend forms the basis of both the noh drama Sessho-seki -LRB- `` The Killing Stone &apos; &apos; -RRB- and the kabuki play Tamamo-no-Mae -LRB- or The Beautiful Fox Witch -RRB- .
The astrologer explained that the beautiful young woman was in fact a kind nine-tailed fox -LRB- kitsune -RRB- working for an evil daimyo , who was making the Emperor ill in a devious plot to take the throne .
Once again in the form of the beautiful Tamamo-no-Mae , the fox prophesied that Miura-no-suke would kill it the next day , and begged for its life .
Finally , an astrologer , Abe no Yasuchika , told the Emperor that Tamamo-no-Mae was the cause of his illness .
Early the next day , the hunters found the fox on the Plain of Nasu , and Miura-no-suke shot and killed the magical creature with an arrow .
The body of the fox became the Sessho-seki , -LRB- æ ç &apos; &apos; ç -RRB- or Killing Stone , which kills anyone that comes in contact with it .
Genno performed certain spiritual rituals , and begged the spirit to consider her spiritual salvation , until finally Hoji relented and swore to never haunt the stone again .
She answered every question posed to her , whether about music , religion or astronomy .
In Matsuo BashÅ &apos; s famous book The Narrow Road to the Deep North , BashÅ tells of visiting the stone in the Japanese prefecture of Nasu .
The Emperor ordered Kazusa-no-suke and Miura-no-suke , the most powerful warriors of the day , to hunt and kill the fox .
Following this , Tamamo-no-Mae disappeared from the court .
Jazz fusion is a musical fusion genre that developed in the late 1960s from a mixture of elements of jazz such as its focus on improvisation with the rhythms and grooves of funk and R &amp; B and the beats and heavily amplified electric instruments and electronic effects of rock . While the term `` jazz rock &apos; &apos; is often used as a synonym for `` jazz fusion &apos; &apos; , it also refers to the music performed by late 1960s and 1970s-era rock bands when they added jazz elements to their music such as free-form improvisation .
Jazz fusion to me is the hardest music to play .
Although the meaning of `` fusion &apos; &apos; became confused with the advent of `` smooth jazz &apos; &apos; , a number of groups helped to revive the jazz fusion genre beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s .
This section lists a few of the jazz fusion artists and albums that are considered to be influential by prominent jazz fusion critics , reviewers , journalists , or music historians . For a longer list , see the List of notable jazz fusion recordings article .
Artists like Lee Ritenour , Al Jarreau , Kenny G , Bob James and David Sanborn among others were leading purveyors of this pop-oriented mixture -LRB- also known as `` west coast &apos; &apos; or `` AOR fusion &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
Many of the most well-known fusion artists were members of earlier jazz fusion groups , and some of the fusion `` giants &apos; &apos; of the 1970s kept working in the genre .

A sender encrypts data with the public key ; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data .
PRNGs that use system entropy to seed data generally produce better results , since this makes the initial conditions of the PRNG much more difficult for an attacker to guess .
Public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key .
The simplest method to read encrypted data is a brute force attack -- simply attempting every number , up to the maximum length of the key .
Key generation is the process of generating keys for cryptography .
Therefore , it is important to use a sufficiently long key length ; longer keys take exponentially longer to attack , rendering a brute force attack impractical .
A key is used to encrypt and decrypt whatever data is being encrypted \ / decrypted .
Modern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms -LRB- such as DES and AES -RRB- and public-key algorithms -LRB- such as RSA -RRB- .
Since public-key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric-key algorithms , modern systems such as TLS and SSH use a combination of the two : one party receives the other &apos; s public key , and encrypts a small piece of data -LRB- either a symmetric key or some data used to generate it -RRB- .
In some cases keys are randomly generated using a random number generator -LRB- RNG -RRB- or pseudorandom number generator -LRB- PRNG -RRB- . A PRNG is a computer algorithm that produces data that appears random under analysis .
Computer cryptography uses integers for keys .
Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key ; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret .
The public key is made available to anyone -LRB- often by means of a digital certificate -RRB- .

In computer science , a lookup table is a data structure , usually an array or associative array , often used to replace a runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation .
Lookup tables are also used extensively to validate input values by matching against a list of valid -LRB- or invalid -RRB- items in an array and , in some programming languages , may include pointer functions -LRB- or offsets to labels -RRB- to process the matching input .
The savings in terms of processing time can be significant , since retrieving a value from memory is often faster than undergoing an ` expensive &apos; computation or input \ / output operation .

In 1868 , when the shogunate came to an end , the city was renamed Tokyo , meaning `` eastern capital &apos; &apos; , and the emperor moved his residence to Tokyo , making the city the formal capital of Japan .
Edo , literally : bay-entrance , `` estuary &apos; &apos; , pronounced , also romanized as Yedo or Yeddo , is the former name of the Japanese capital Tokyo , and was the seat of power for the Tokugawa shogunate which ruled Japan from 1603 to 1868 .
Edo consequently rapidly grew from what had been a small , virtually unknown fishing village in 1457 to a metropolis with an estimated population of 1,000,000 by 1721 , the largest city in the world at the time .
From the establishment of the Tokugawa bakufus headquarters at Edo , Kyoto remained merely the formal capital of the country . The de facto capital was now Edo , because it was the center of real political power .
During this period it grew to become one of the largest cities in the world and the site of a vibrant urban culture centered on notions of the `` floating world &apos; &apos; .

The National Football Conference -LRB- NFC -RRB- is one of the two -LRB- NFC and AFC -RRB- conferences of the National Football League -LRB- NFL -RRB- .
The NFC playoffs culminate in the NFC Championship Game for the George Halas Trophy .
While all of the former AFL teams along with the NFL &apos; s Cleveland Browns , Pittsburgh Steelers , and Baltimore Colts formed the American Football Conference -LRB- AFC -RRB- , the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC .
The NFC Champion plays the AFC Champion in the Super Bowl .
The Carolina Panthers joined the NFC in 1995 .
The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment .
At the end of each season , a series of playoff games are contested among the top six teams in the NFC , consisting of the four division champions -LRB- by place standing -RRB- and the two other teams -LRB- `` wild cards &apos; &apos; -RRB- with the best win-loss records .
Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the teams &apos; final record in the previous season .
When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976 , they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC , respectively , for one season before they switched conferences .
This assignment shifts each year .
The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions .
However , team owners could not agree to a plan on how to align the clubs in the NFC .

His father had him made a British citizen , a decision that would later allow Gambon to receive an actual , rather than honorary , knighthood and CBE -LRB- although , under the British Nationality Act 1981 anyone born in Ireland before 1949 can still register as a British subject and , after five years &apos; UK residence , become a British citizen -RRB- .
In 1992 he played a psychotic general in the Barry Levinson film Toys and he also starred as Georges Simenon &apos; s detective Inspector Jules Maigret in an ITV adaptation of Simenon &apos; s series of books .
I &apos; m not really a character actor at all ... &apos; &apos;
By the time he was 21 , he was a fully qualified engineer .
-LRB- Harris had also played Maigret on television four years before Gambon took that role . -RRB-
The final corner of the Dunsfold Park track has been named `` Gambon &apos; &apos; in his honor .
Gambon is a very private person , a `` non-starry star &apos; &apos; as Ayckbourn called him .
I just stick on a beard and play me , so it &apos; s no great feat .
He clipped his namesake corner the second time , and when asked why by Jeremy Clarkson , replied , `` I dunno - I just do n &apos;t like it . &apos; &apos;
After this success , for which he won a BAFTA , his work includes such controversial films as The Cook , The Thief , His Wife and Her Lover , which also starred Helen Mirren .
He made his film debut in the Laurence Olivier Othello in 1965 .
He currently does the voice over to the new Guinness ads with the penguins .
As a result , Gambon was asked by James Bond producer Cubby Broccoli to audition for the role in 1970 , to replace George Lazenby .
Gambon , along with Robert Stephens , Derek Jacobi and Frank Finlay , was hired as one of the `` to be renowned &apos; &apos; and played any number of small roles , appearing on cast lists as Mike Gambon .
A year later , cheekily auditioning with the opening soliloquy from Richard III , he caught the eye of star-maker Laurence Olivier who was recruiting promising spear carriers for his new National Theatre Company .
Also like Richardson , interviews are rarely given and raise more questions than they answer .
While filming Gosford Park , Gambon brought Philippa Hart on to the set and introduced her to co-stars as his girlfriend .
His father , Edward Gambon , was an engineer , and his mother , Mary -LRB- nÃ e Hoare -RRB- , was a seamstress .
But together with Simon Russell Beale and Alan Bates he gave a deliciously droll radio account of the role of Marc .
Five years later he wrote a letter to Michael MacLiammoir , the Irish theater impresario who ran Dublin &apos; s Gate Theatre .
Aged 19 , while at RADA , he joined the Unity Theatre in King &apos; s Cross .
Gambon raced the Suzuki Liana and was driving so aggressively that it went round the last corner of his timed lap on two wheels .
Perhaps his most significant role in 2004 was Albus Dumbledore , Hogwarts &apos; s headmaster in the third installment of J. K. Rowling &apos; s franchise , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , taking over from the late Richard Harris .
He appeared on the program again on 4 June 2006 , and set a time in the Chevrolet Lacetti of 1 : 50.3 , a significant improvement on his previous time of 1 : 55 .
It was accompanied by a CV describing a rich and wholly imaginary theater career - and he was taken on .
`` Skylight was ten times as hard to play as anything I &apos; ve ever done &apos; &apos; he told Michael Owen in the Evening Standard .
Sir Michael John Gambon , CBE -LRB- born 19 October 1940 -RRB- is an Irish-born British actor who has worked in theater , television and film .
He starred as Fyodor Dostoyevsky in the Hungarian director KÃ roly Makk &apos; s movie The Gambler -LRB- 1997 -RRB- about the writing of Dostoyevsky &apos; s novella The Gambler .
In 2001 he played what he described as `` a physically repulsive &apos; &apos; Davies in Patrick Marber &apos; s revival of Pinter &apos; s The Caretaker , but he found the rehearsal period an unhappy experience , and felt that he had let down the author .
Gambon is a qualified private pilot and his love of cars led to his appearance on the BBC &apos; s Top Gear program .
Hall called him `` unsentimental , dangerous and immensely powerful &apos; &apos; , even The Sunday Times curmudgeonly critic of the day called his performance `` a decisive step in the direction of great tragedy ... great acting &apos; &apos; , while fellow actors paid him the rare compliment of applauding him in the dressing room on the first night .
Gambon reprised the role of Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , which was released in November 2005 in the United Kingdom and the United States .
Gambon made his professional stage dÃ but in the Gate Theatre Dublin &apos; s 1962 production of Othello , playing `` Second Gentleman &apos; &apos; , followed by a European tour .
Similarly , he has also misled another interviewer to believe that , when playing Dumbledore , he does not `` have to play anyone really .
They have one son , Fergus , an expert on the BBC &apos; s Antiques Roadshow .
But it was not until Dennis Potter &apos; s The Singing Detective -LRB- 1986 -RRB- that he became a household name .
From the first Ralph Richardson dubbed him The Great Gambon , an accolade which stuck , outshining his 1990 CBE , even the later knighthood , although Gambon dismisses it as a circus slogan .
I never ease into a roleâ &apos; &apos; every part I play is just a variant of my own personality .
He then gained an apprenticeship with Vickers Armstrong as a toolmaker .
In 2007 he played major roles in Stephen Poliakoff &apos; s Joe &apos; s Palace , and the five-part adaptation of Mrs Gaskell &apos; s Cranford novels , both for BBC TV .
He returned to the role again in the fifth film , 2007 &apos; s Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , and the sixth film , Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince .
When the affair was revealed in 2002 , he moved out of the marital home and bought a bachelor pad .
And for the RSC he shared Reza &apos; s two-hander The Unexpected Man with Eileen Atkins , first at The Pit in the Barbican and then at the Duchess Theatre , a production also intended for New York but finally delayed by other commitments .
The couple lived near Gravesend , Kent , where she has a workshop .
He kept the job for a further year , acquiring a fascination and passion for collecting antique guns , clocks , watches , and classic cars .
In February 2007 , it was revealed that Hart was pregnant with Gambon &apos; s child , and gave birth to son , Michael , in May 2007 .
Brought up as a strict Roman Catholic , he attended St Aloysius Boys &apos; School in Somers Town and served at the altar .
This was to serve him in good stead in John Dexter &apos; s masterly staging of The Life of Galileo in 1980 , the first Brecht to become a popular success .
In 2004 , he appeared in five films , including Wes Anderson &apos; s quirky comedy The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou ; the British gangster flick Layer Cake ; theatrical drama Being Julia ; and CGI action fantasy Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow .
A year later , playing opposite Daniel Craig , he portrayed the father of a series of cloned sons in Caryl Churchill &apos; s A Number at the Royal Court , notable for a recumbent moment when he smoked a cigarette , the brightly lit spiral of smoke rising against a black backdrop , an effect which he dreamed up during rehearsals .
In 2004 he finally achieved a life-long ambition to play Falstaff , in Nicholas Hytner &apos; s National production of Henry IV , Parts 1 and 2 , co-starring with Matthew Macfadyen as Prince Hal .
A speedy transfer to the West End established him as a brilliant comic actor , squatting at a crowded dining table on a tiny chair and sublimely agonising over a choice between black or white coffee .
Hart , who worked with Gambon on the film , Sylvia in 2003 , in late 2006 moved into a Â # 500,000 terraced home in Chiswick , west London .
But as Sheridan Morley perceptively remarked in 2000 , when reviewing Cressida : `` Gambon &apos; s eccentricity on stage now begins to rival that of his great mentor Richardson &apos; &apos; .
Gambon played for four years in many NT productions , including named roles in The Recruiting Officer and The Royal Hunt of the Sun , working with directors William Gaskill and John Dexter .
He later attended a school in Kent , before leaving with no qualifications at fifteen .
His father decided to seek work in the rebuilding of London , and so the family moved to Mornington Crescent in North London , when Gambon was five .
Off-stage he prefers to back out of the limelight , an unpretentious guy sharing laughs with his fellow cast and crew .
As Simon Callow once said : `` Gambon &apos; s iron lungs and overwhelming charisma are able to command a sort of operatic full-throatedness which triumphs over hard walls and long distances &apos; &apos; .
David Hare &apos; s Skylight , with Lia Williams , which opened to rave reviews at the National in 1995 , transferred first to Wyndham &apos; s Theatre and then on to Broadway for a four-month run which left him in a state of advanced exhaustion .
Back at the National , now on the South Bank , his next turning point was Peter Hall &apos; s premiere staging of Harold Pinter &apos; s Betrayal , an unexpectedly subtle performance - a production photograph shows him embracing Penelope Wilton with sensitive hands and long slim fingers -LRB- the touch of a master clock-maker -RRB- .
His rise to stardom began in 1974 when Eric Thompson cast him as the melancholy vet in Alan Ayckbourn &apos; s The Norman Conquests at Greenwich .
Gambon married Anne Miller when he was 22 , but has always been secretive about his personal life , responding to one interviewer &apos; s question about her : `` What wife ? &apos; &apos;
He performed as Joe in Beckett &apos; s Eh Joe , giving two performances a night at the Duke of York &apos; s Theatre in London .
He then moved to St Aloysius &apos; College in Hornsey Lane , Highgate , London , whose former pupils include Peter Sellers and Joe Cole .
His craggy looks soon made him into a character actor , although he won critical acclaim as Galileo in John Dexter &apos; s production of The Life of Galileo by Brecht at the National Theatre in 1980 .
He is also one of the few actors to have mastered the harsh demands of the vast Olivier Theatre .
Gambon was invested by Prince Charles as a Knight Bachelor on 17 July 1998 for `` services to drama &apos; &apos; . -LRB- Queen Elizabeth II &apos; s approval for the award was notified in the 1998 New Year Honours List . -RRB-

These are particularly common in chip pan fires , which are responsible for one in five house fires in Britain .
Consequently , they are better suited when the goal is to move an object -LRB- a bullet in a gun , or a piston in an internal combustion engine -RRB- with the force of the expanding gas .
This simplified model neglects the change of temperature and thus the burning rate across the deflagration front .
Damage to buildings , equipment and people can result from a large-scale short-duration deflagration .
For a stationary moving deflagration front , these two timescales are equal : The heat generated by burning is equal to the heat carried away by heat transfer .
Between these extremes both heat and pressure are released .
In free-air deflagrations , there is a continuous variation in deflagration effects relative to maximum flame velocity .
The potential damage is primarily a function of the total amount of fuel burned in the event -LRB- total energy available -RRB- , the maximum flame velocity that is achieved , and the manner in which the expansion of the combustion gases is contained .
The water boils rapidly and ejects the burning material as a fine spray of droplets .
Typical examples of deflagrations are the combustion of a gas-air mixture in a gas stove or a fuel-air mixture in an internal combustion engine , and the rapid burning of gunpowder in a firearm or of pyrotechnic mixtures in fireworks .
The first is the thermal diffusion timescale , which is approximately equal to
The net result is that the volume of the vessel or structure needs to either expand \ / fail to accommodate the hot combustion gases , or build internal pressure to contain them .
When flame velocities are low , the effect of a deflagration is the release of heat .
Deflagration is different from detonation -LRB- which is supersonic and propagates through shock compression -RRB- .
When a low-speed deflagration occurs within a closed vessel or structure , pressure effects can produce damage due to expansion of gases , as a secondary effect .
We can better understand the underlying flame physics by constructing an idealized model consisting of a uniform one-dimensional tube of unburnt and burned gaseous fuel , separated by a thin transitional region of width in which the burning occurs .
The risks of deflagration inside waste storage drums is a growing concern among storage facilities .
Deflagration -LRB- Lat : de + flagrare , `` to burn down &apos; &apos; -RRB- is a technical term describing subsonic combustion that usually propagates through thermal conductivity -LRB- hot burning material heats the next layer of cold material and ignites it -RRB- .
where is the thermal diffusivity .
The second is the burning timescale that strongly decreases with temperature , typically as
Most `` fire &apos; &apos; found in daily life , from flames to explosions , is technically deflagration .
The burning region is commonly referred to as the flame or flame front .
At flame velocities near the speed of sound , the energy released is in the form of pressure and the results resemble a detonation .
As a result , this derivation gives the laminar flame speed -- hence the designation .
This lets us find the characteristic width of the flame front :
Addition of water to a burning hydrocarbon such as oil or wax produces a deflagration .
The heat released by the deflagration causes the combustion gases and excess air to try to expand thermally as well .
In equilibrium , thermal diffusion across the flame front is balanced by the heat supplied by burning .
See drum deflagration videos
Some authors use the term flash fire to describe these low-speed deflagrations .
where is the activation barrier for the burning reaction and is the temperature developed as the result of burning that can be found from thermodynamics -LRB- the so-called `` flame temperature &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
There are two characteristic timescales which are important here .
In engineering applications , deflagrations are easier to control than detonations .
A deflagration then occurs , as the fine mist of oil ignites and burns extremely rapidly .
Also this model neglects the possible influence of turbulence .

Market capitalization represents the public consensus on the value of a company &apos; s equity .
Insurance firms use a value called the embedded value -LRB- EV -RRB- .
Its market capitalization is the share price multiplied by the number of shares in issue , providing a total value for the company &apos; s shares and thus for the company as a whole .
Market capitalization -LRB- often market cap -RRB- is a measurement of size of a business enterprise -LRB- corporation -RRB- equal to the share price times the number of shares outstanding -LRB- shares that have been authorized , issued , and purchased by investors -RRB- of a publicly traded company .
The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world was US $ 51.2 trillion in January 2007 and rose as high as US $ 57.5 trillion in May 2008 before dropping below US $ 50 trillion in August 2008 and slightly above US $ 40 trillion in September 2008 .
Market cap reflects only the equity value of a company .
A more comprehensive measure is enterprise value -LRB- EV -RRB- , which includes debt and other factors .
Note that market capitalization is a market estimate of a company &apos; s value , based on perceived future prospects , economic and monetary conditions .
An entirely public corporation , including all of its assets , may be freely bought and sold through purchases and sales of stock , which will determine the price of the company &apos; s shares .

In some non-English-speaking cultures , `` a divided by b &apos; &apos; is written a : b . However , in English usage the colon is restricted to expressing the related concept of ratios -LRB- then `` a is to b &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
This form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic .
For example , a divided by b is written
In the above expression , a is called the dividend , b the divisor and c the quotient .
A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are integers -LRB- although typically called the numerator and denominator -RRB- , and there is no implication that the division needs to be evaluated further .
This can be read out loud as `` a divided by b &apos; &apos; , `` a by b &apos; &apos; or `` a over b &apos; &apos; .
The obelus is also used alone to represent the division operation itself , as for instance as a label on a key of a calculator .
Any of these forms can be used to display a fraction .
A way to express division all on one line is to write the dividend , or numerator then a slash , then the divisor , or denominator like this :
Division is often shown in algebra and science by placing the dividend over the divisor with a horizontal line , also called a vinculum or fraction bar , between them .
This is the usual way to specify division in most computer programming languages since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of ASCII characters .

The tunnel , which was about 1.2 m high by 0.9 m wide , extended more than 1000 m beyond the MDL into South Korea .
He said the south side of the wall is packed with soil , which permits access to the top of the wall and makes it effectively invisible from the south side .
In the Armistice Agreement of July 27 , 1953 , the DMZ was created as each side agreed to move their troops back 2000 m from the front line , creating a buffer zone 4 k wide .
In the North , Kijong-dong features a number of brightly painted , poured-concrete multi-story buildings and apartments with electric lighting .
Sporadic outbreaks of violence due to North Korean hostilities killed over 500 South Korean soldiers and 50 U.S. soldiers along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999 .

Since then the resort and the Donghae Bukbu Line have effectively been closed by the North .
Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ , but they may not cross the MDL .
The defector was not captured .
Upon their discovery , North Korea claimed that the tunnels were for coal mining ; however , no coal has been found in the tunnels , which are dug through granite , but some of the tunnel walls have been painted black to give the appearance of anthracite .
Currently the South uses the original name , but the North refers to the route as the P ` yÅ ngbu Line .
One South Korean and three North Korean soldiers were killed in the action .
Tae Sung Dong and Kijong-dong were the only villages allowed by the armistice committee to remain within the boundaries of the DMZ .

The blast also wounded five Americans and one South Korean from the United Nations Command .
The railway line has been mainly used to carry materials and South Korean workers to the industrial complexes at Kaesong .
Following each discovery , engineering within the tunnels has become progressively more advanced .
The conflict , which claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines , commenced on June 25 , 1950 , with a Soviet-sponsored DPRK invasion across the 38th parallel , and ended in 1953 after international intervention pushed the front of the war back to near the 38th parallel .
The new rail crossing was built adjacent to the road which took South Koreans to KÅ mgangsan , a region that has significant cultural importance for all Koreans .
Residents of Tae Sung Dong are governed and protected by the United Nations Command and are generally required to spend at least 240 nights per year in the village to maintain their residency .

The villagers of Tae Sung Dong are direct descendants of people who owned the land before the 1950 â `` 53 Korean War .
According to the United States , the wall does not exist , although there are anti-tank barriers along some sections of the DMZ .
However in November 2008 North Korean authorities closed the railway amid growing tensions with the South .
The tunnels are believed to have been planned as a military invasion route by North Korea .
In 2008 , the village had a population of 218 people .

The road at Panmunjeom , which was known historically as Highway One in the South , was originally the only access point between the two countries on the Korean Peninsula .
This tunnel is about 1600 m long and about 150 m below ground .
The 38th parallel northâ &apos; &apos; which divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in halfâ &apos; &apos; was the original boundary between the United States-occupied and Soviet-occupied areas of Korea at the end of World War II .
Originally , it was the only connection between North and South Korea but that changed in 2007 when a Korail train crossed the DMZ to the North on the new Donghae Bukbu Line built on the east coast of Korea .
Villagers are classed as Republic of Korea citizens , however they are exempt from paying tax and other civic requirements such as military service .

Foreign visitors touring the South Korean DMZ may view inside this tunnel using a sloped access shaft .

By the eve of the First World War , the Ottoman state , despite its weakness relative to Europe , represented the largest and most powerful independent Islamic political entity .
However , the ShiÊ &apos; &apos; at Ê &apos; &apos; AlÄ `` , `` the Party of Ali &apos; &apos; , were again disappointed when the Abbasid dynasty took power , as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammad &apos; s uncle , ` Abbas ibn ` Abd al-Muttalib and not from Ali .
Large territories , including those with large Muslim populations , such as Crimea , were lost to the Russian Empire .
1258 saw the conquest of Baghdad and the execution of Abbasid caliph al-Musta ` sim by Mongol forces under Hulagu Khan .
Its leaders included Maulana Mohammad Ali , his brother Shawkat Ali , and Abul Kalam Azad , Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari , and Barrister Muhammad Jan Abbasi .
However , the Ottomans under Abdul Hamid I claimed a diplomatic victory by being allowed to remain the religious leader of Muslims in the now-independent Crimea as part of the peace treaty : in return Russia became the official protector of Christians in Ottoman territory .
Mehmed II and his grandson Selim I used it to justify their conquest of Islamic countries .
The outcome of this war was disastrous for the Ottomans .
In areas which were previously under Sassanid Persian or Byzantine rule , the Caliphs lowered taxes , provided greater local autonomy -LRB- to their delegated governors -RRB- , greater religious freedom for Jews , and some indigenous Christians , and brought peace to peoples demoralized and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the decades of Byzantine-Persian warfare .
Muawiyah transformed the caliphate into a hereditary office , thus founding the Umayyad dynasty .
Uthman was killed by members of a disaffected group .
The Caliphate of CÃ rdoba -LRB- Ø Ù Ù Ù Ø Ù Ø Ø Ø Ø -RRB- ruled most of the Iberian Peninsula from the city of CÃ rdoba from 929 to 1031 .
This made it one of the largest unitary states in history and one of the few states to ever extend direct rule over three continents -LRB- Africa , Europe , and Asia -RRB- .
Ottoman rulers used the title `` Caliph &apos; &apos; symbolically on many occasions but it was strengthened when the Ottoman Empire defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517 and took control of most Arab lands .
Ali then took control but was not universally accepted as caliph by the governors of Egypt , and later by some of his own guard .
There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads , as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks -LRB- notably , the rivalry between Yaman and Qays -RRB- .
Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey , the parliament of the newly formed Turkish Republic .
All Caliphs of CÃ rdoba were members of the Umayyad dynasty ; the same dynasty had held the title Emir of CÃ rdoba and ruled over roughly the same territory since 756 .
Although not ruling all of the Sahara , homage was paid to the Caliph by Saharan Africa , usually via various nomad Berber tribes .
Ù Ø Ù Ø Ø Ø Ø -RRB- .
This period was characterized by remarkable flourishing in technology , trade and culture ; many of the masterpieces of Spain were constructed in this period , including the famous Great Mosque of CÃ rdoba .
On March 3 , 1924 , the first President of the Turkish Republic , Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ 1 \ / 4 rk , as part of his reforms , constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate .
In the 1920s , the Khilafat Movement , a movement to defend the Ottoman Caliphate , spread throughout the British colonial territories in what is now Pakistan .
Muawiyah , a relative of Uthman and governor -LRB- Wali -RRB- of Syria , became one of Ali &apos; s challengers and after Ali &apos; s death managed to overcome the other claimants to the Caliphate .
It was particularly strong in British India , where it formed a rallying point for some Indian Muslims as one of many anti-British Indian political movements .
When the Caliphate was seized by the Abbasids , Al-Andalus -LRB- the Arab name for Hispania -RRB- split from the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad to form their own caliphate .
During the Ummayad dynasty , Hispania was an integral province of the Ummayad Caliphate ruled from Damascus , Syria .
Around 1880 Sultan Abdul Hamid II reasserted the title as a way of countering Russian expansion into Muslim lands .
This period is known as the Fitna , or the first Islamic civil war .
Eventually , supporters of the Banu Hashim and the supporters of the lineage of Ali united to bring down the Umayyads in 750 .
Some supported prominent early Muslims like Al-Zubayr ; others felt that only members of Muhammad &apos; s clan , the Banu Hashim , or his own lineage , the descendants of Ali , should rule .
Ottoman rulers -LRB- generally known as Sultans in the West -RRB- were known primarily by the title of Padishah and used the title of Caliph only sporadically .
A surviving member of the Abbasid house was installed as caliph at Cairo under the patronage of the newly formed Mamluk Sultanate three years later ; however , this line of caliphs had generally little authority although some Abbasid rulers had the actual rule over the Mamluk Sultans . Later Muslim historians referred to it as a `` shadow &apos; &apos; caliphate .
Abu Bakr , the first successor of Muhammad , according to Sunni beliefs , nominated Umar as his successor on his deathbed , and there was consensus in the Muslim community to his choice .
As the Ottoman Empire grew in size and strength , Ottoman rulers beginning with Selim I began to claim Caliphal authority .
For a time it worked in alliance with Hindu communities and was supported by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi , who was a member of the Central Khilafat Committee .
He faced two major rebellions and was assassinated after a tumultuous rule of only five years .
Initially controlling Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia and Libya , the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years , taking Egypt and Palestine , before the Abbasid dynasty was able to turn the tide , limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt .
Under the Umayyads , the Caliphate grew rapidly in territory .
The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171 .
His claim was most fervently accepted by the Muslims of British India .
The ShiÊ &apos; &apos; a Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty , which claimed descent from Muhammad through his daughter , claimed the title of Caliph in 909 , creating a separate line of caliphs in North Africa .
The title Caliph -LRB- Ø Ù Ù Ù Ø -RRB- was claimed by Abd-ar-Rahman III on 16 January 929 ; he was previously known as the Emir of CÃ rdoba -LRB- Ø # Ù
His successor , Uthman Ibn Affan , was elected by a council of electors -LRB- Majlis -RRB- , but was soon perceived by some to be ruling as a `` king &apos; &apos; rather than an elected leader .
The last Abbasid Caliph at Cairo , al-Mutawakkil III , was taken into custody and was transported to Constantinople , where he reportedly surrendered the Caliphate to Selim I. According to Barthold , the first time the title of `` Caliph &apos; &apos; was used as a political instead of symbolic religious title by the Ottomans was the peace treaty with Russia in 1774 .
Islamic rule expanded westward across North Africa and into Hispania and eastward through Persia and ultimately to the ancient lands of Indus Valley , in modern day Pakistan .

In 1655 , the advocate of Galenic physiology Edmund O &apos;Meara said that `` the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state . &apos; &apos;
Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle â &apos; &apos; many people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans .
Arguing that `` experiments on animals ... are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man ... the effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals , save for differences in degree , &apos; &apos; Bernard established animal experimentation as part of the standard scientific method .
In the 19th century , laws regulating drugs were more relaxed .
On November 3 , 1957 , a Russian dog , Laika , became the first of many animals to orbit the earth .
The earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the Greeks in the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE .
The terms animal testing , animal experimentation , animal research , in vivo testing , and vivisection have similar denotations but different connotations .
The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals ; for example , the EncyclopÃ dia Britannica defines `` vivisection &apos; &apos; as : `` Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes ; more broadly , all experimentation on live animals &apos; &apos; , although dictionaries point out that the broader definition is `` used only by people who are opposed to such work &apos; &apos; .
In the 1880s , Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep .
In the 1970s , antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos , then given to humans .
In the 1890s , Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning .
O &apos;Meara and others argued that animal physiology could be affected by pain during vivisection , rendering results unreliable .
Supporters of the use of animals in experiments , such as the British Royal Society , argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way , with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arguing that even sophisticated computers are unable to model interactions between molecules , cells , tissues , organs , organisms , and the environment , making animal research necessary in many areas .
This genetic research progressed rapidly and , in 1996 , Dolly the sheep was born , the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell .
Aristotle -LRB- Î ` Ï Î Ï Ï Î Ï Î Î &apos; &apos; Î Ï -RRB- -LRB- 384 â `` 322 BCE -RRB- and Erasistratus -LRB- 304 â `` 258 BCE -RRB- were among the first to perform experiments on living animals .
Animal testing , also known as animal experimentation , animal research , and in vivo testing , is the use of non-human animals in experiments .
Toxicology testing became important in the 20th century .
Galen , a physician in 2nd-century Rome , dissected pigs and goats , and is known as the `` father of vivisection . &apos; &apos;
The word `` vivisection &apos; &apos; is preferred by those opposed to this research , whereas scientists typically use the term `` animal experimentation &apos; &apos; .
On the other side of the debate , those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge .
In 1896 , the physiologist and physician Dr. Walter B. Cannon said â The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said , â Common sense without conscience may lead to crime , but conscience without common sense may lead to folly , which is the handmaiden of crime .
However , in response to the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users , the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed .
â â These divisions between pro- and anti- animal testing groups first came to public attention during the brown dog affair in the early 1900s , when hundreds of medical students clashed with anti-vivisectionists and police over a memorial to a vivisected dog .
The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch was able to produce the first transgenic mammal , by integrating DNA from the SV40 virus into the genome of mice .
Claude Bernard , known as the `` prince of vivisectors &apos; &apos; and the father of physiologyâ &apos; &apos; whose wife , Marie FranÃ oise Martin , founded the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883 â &apos; &apos; famously wrote in 1865 that `` the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen &apos; &apos; .

The contemporary reputation of Busnois was immense ; he was the probably the best-known musician in Europe between the time of Guillaume Dufay and Johannes Ockeghem .
He moved from the cathedral to the collegiate church of St. Martin , also in Tours , where he became a subdeacon in 1465 .
Of his sacred music , two cantus firmus masses and eight motets survive -LRB- most likely many others are lost -RRB- .
He was the leading figure of the late Burgundian school after the death of Guillaume Dufay .
Johannes Ockeghem was treasurer at that institution , and the two composers seem to have known each other well .
Later in 1465 Busnois moved to Poitiers , where he not only became `` maÃ trise &apos; &apos; -LRB- master of the choirboys -RRB- , but managed to attract a flood of talented singers from the entire region ; by this time his reputation as singing teacher , scholar , and composer seems to have spread widely .
While also noted as a composer of sacred music , such as motets , he was one of the most renowned 15th-century composers of secular chansons .
Antoine Busnois -LRB- also Busnoys -RRB- -LRB- c . 1430 -- November 6 , 1492 -RRB- was a French composer and poet of the early Renaissance Burgundian School .
Busnois wrote sacred and secular music .
However he departed just as suddenly as he came , in 1466 ; no reason was given , but the former maÃ trise was given his old job back . Busnois then moved to Burgundy .
According to Pietro Aron , Busnois may have been the composer of the famous tune L &apos;homme armÃ , one of the most widely distributed melodies of the Renaissance , and the one more often used than any other as a cantus firmus for mass composition .
Whether or not he wrote the first mass based on L &apos;homme armÃ , his was by far the most influential ; Obrecht &apos; s mass , for example , closely parallels the setting by Busnois and even the mass by Dufay quotes from it directly .
Stylistically , his music can be heard as a mid-point between the simplicity and homophonic textures of Dufay and Binchois , and the pervading imitation of Josquin and Gombert .

Laura degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone later that morning , and the final advisory by the National Hurricane Center was issued .
The 12th named storm of the season , Laura formed out of a large extratropical area of low pressure located about 1015 miles -LRB- 1635 km -RRB- west of the Azores on September 29 .
Laura slowly developed tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters .
During the afternoon , satellites revealed that Laura had developed a deep warm core , a characteristic of a tropical cyclone , but the wind field remained subtropical in nature .
Tropical Storm Laura was a short lived tropical cyclone that developed over the north-central Atlantic Ocean in late September during the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season .
Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed due to poor driving conditions .
Despite moving over colder waters , a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low , signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone .
On the afternoon of September 30 , Laura had acquired enough tropical characteristics to be designated a Tropical Storm .
Upon being upgraded , cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation .
Shortly after being declared tropical , Laura began to undergo an extratropical transition , which did not fully take place until the morning of October 1 .
Overnight , convection associated with Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics , but still retained its status .
By September 29 , the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura .
The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying .
Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around the center of the system .
At the time , its rain bands began interacting with a cold front associated with a well-developed low west of Norway , dropping up to 113 mm -LRB- 4.4 in -RRB- of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands . Consequently , streets and homes in the village of Hippolytushoef were reportedly inundated .
By the nighttime hours , the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80 mi -LRB- 130 km -RRB- , much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone .
However , the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September 30 , but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical .
Early on October 1 , the extratropical transition was fully apparent .
However , Laura was still under the influence of an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow .
As a tropical cyclone , Laura never approached land , and no damages or fatalities occurred .
As a result , more than 10,000 people lost power in southern parts of the country .
A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60 mph -LRB- 95 km \ / h -RRB- .
Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day .
As a result , Glebe Road near Windermere , England was closed in both directions , and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale , previously saturated soil , combined with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding .
Despite the lack of impact , the storm &apos; s remnants were caught in an upper-level jet stream , and steered towards Europe .
Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude , 40.6 Â N. Not long after being declared tropical , early signs of an extratropical transition appeared .

There is no publication date and Wikipedia does not have to be finished today .
Perfection is neither desired nor achievable .
Wikipedia is not paper and has no need to work towards a deadline .
And if it takes a long time for that process to work , so what ?
There are various points of view on what this lack of a deadline means .
And if someone beats you to it , makes that first place in the edit history , so what ?
We can afford to take our time , to consider matters , to wait before creating a new article until its significance is unambiguously established .
There is no finished version expected soon , and it is perfectly acceptable to let the editing process fashion an article up to our standards eventually .
Wikipedia is a work in progress , and will always remain so .
Merge in what you have and turn a stub or whatever into a good article .
A small number of articles might make Wikipedia 1.0 , but the vast majority will not and for the balance there is no deadline .
Wikipedia is not a competition either .
It merely needs to have improved on yesterday .
By creating an unfinished article , you encourage other people to contribute ; collaboration on articles will earn you far greater respect than solo editing .
There really are no points for being first ; being the author of the best and most neutral content will earn you far greater kudos .
Turn this into a strength by working on your article in your userspace or scratchpad until you have the best possible article , fully referenced , a masterpiece of neutrality .
Above all , creating an article without establishing the basis of the content and its significance is a bad idea .
Wikipedia is not working to a deadline .
Wikipedia is not Wikinews and has no need to scoop anyone .
We can afford to take our time to improve articles , to wait before deleting a new article unless its potential significance can not be established .

The Molotov cocktail , also known as the petrol bomb , gasoline bomb , Molotov bomb , fire bottle , fire bomb , or simply Molotov , is a generic name used for a variety of improvised incendiary weapons .
When Soviet People &apos; s Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that they were not bombing , but rather delivering food to the starving Finns , the Finns started to call the air bombs Molotov bread baskets .
At first , the term was used to describe only the burning mixture itself , but in practical use the term was soon applied to the combination of both the bottle and its contents .
Soon they responded by attacking advancing tanks with `` Molotov cocktails &apos; &apos; which were `` a drink to go with the food &apos; &apos; .
The name `` Molotov cocktail &apos; &apos; was coined by the Finns during Winter War to mock Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov , the Chairman of the Council of People &apos; s Commissars of the Soviet Union -LRB- i.e. Soviet Prime Minister -RRB- and the People &apos; s Commissar for Foreign Affairs at the time .

These equations arise from applying Newton &apos; s second law to fluid motion , together with the assumption that the fluid stress is the sum of a diffusing viscous term -LRB- proportional to the gradient of velocity -RRB- , plus a pressure term .
The Navierâ `` Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars , the study of blood flow , the design of power stations , the analysis of pollution , and many other things .
Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid ; however for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories .
These are called the Navierâ `` Stokes existence and smoothness problems .
The equations are useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest .
A solution of the Navierâ `` Stokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field , which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time .
Once the velocity field is solved for , other quantities of interest -LRB- such as flow rate or drag force -RRB- may be found .
The Navierâ `` Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense .
They may be used to model the weather , ocean currents , water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing .
The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US $ 1,000,000 prize for a solution or a counter-example .
Somewhat surprisingly , given their wide range of practical uses , mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist -LRB- existence -RRB- , or that if they do exist , then they do not contain any singularity -LRB- smoothness -RRB- .
This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics , where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a particle or deflection of a continuum .
The Navierâ `` Stokes equations dictate not position but rather velocity .
Coupled with Maxwell &apos; s equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics .
The Navierâ `` Stokes equations are nonlinear partial differential equations in almost every real situation .
In physics , the Navierâ `` Stokes equations , named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes , describe the motion of fluid substances .

The French annexed the Batavian Republic in 1810 , and Overijssel was organised into the new French dÃ partement of Bouches-de-l ` Yssel .
In the northwest , the geology is dominated by sediments from the Overijsselse Vecht and clay .
After the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 , the kingdom of the Netherlands and the former province of Overijssel were recreated .
Only small patches survive today -LRB- Engbertsdijksvenen near Tubbergen , Witteveen -LRB- near Haaksbergen -RRB- , and the Aamsveen -LRB- near Enschede -RRB- .
Widespread resistance against the increased power throughout the provinces eventually led to the formation of the Batavian Republic in 1795 .
The northern parts were once covered by veen -LRB- bogs -RRB- which separated the dryer and more arable south from Drenthe and which have been exploited as fuel to a large degree .
At first organised into its own dÃ partement , it was merged with Drenthe in 1798 to form Ouden IJssel , which was renamed Overijssel in 1801 .
The people joined with the other Dutch and rebelled against Charles &apos; heir Philip II .
After a brief occupation by the forces of the Bishop of MÃ 1 \ / 4 nster -LRB- 1672 â `` 74 -RRB- , Overijssel received a new form of government which granted the stadtholders more power .
Overijssel was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II from May 1940 until its liberation in April 1945 .
A centralist government arose and the Netherlands was organised into a series of dÃ partements , based on those used by revolutionary France .
The lowest point is in the Mastenbroek Polder near Kampen at 2 metres -LRB- 6 ft -RRB- below sea level .
Overijssel comprises three regions : Kop van Overijssel in the northwest , Salland in the center of the province , and Twente in the east .
The Noordoostpolder , which had been laid dry in 1942 , was part of Overijssel from 1962 until 1986 , when it became part of the newly created province of Flevoland .
The Bishops ceded the Oversticht to the Emperor Charles V in 1528 , who styled himself `` Lord of Overijssel &apos; &apos; , thereby giving the province its modern name .
Overijssel is bordered by Germany to the east , the Achterhoek region of Gelderland to the south , the Veluwe region of Gelderland and Flevoland to the west , and Friesland and the former moors of Drenthe to the north .
The extreme northwest is dominated by a system of lakes formed by former peat-mining , the Weerribben , which is a valuable wetland .
The province &apos; s name means `` Lands across river IJssel &apos; &apos; .
During its early history , Overijssel was formerly known as Oversticht and also included much of modern-day Drenthe .

Silver plating is not as comfortable or as expensive as gold , but still has properties and qualities that are sometimes necessary for some styles of playing .
Stainless steel and titanium mouthpieces hold many advantages to the classic brass mouthpiece , including , anecdotally , a much more centered feel and sound , as stainless steel and titanium do not absorb as many vibrations as brass ; they require much less care ; etc . , but they are much more expensive -LRB- titanium mouthpieces run up to about $ 400 each -RRB- .

Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download .
In the early days of the recording industry , record labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist .
Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made .
With the Internet now being a viable source for obtaining music , netlabels have emerged .
Such labels have a reputation for being fiercely uncompromising and especially unwilling to cooperate with the big six -LRB- now big four -RRB- record labels at all .
Many artists have had albums altered or censored in some way by the labels before they are releasedâ &apos; &apos; songs being edited , artwork or titles being changed , etc . .
The singer turned down lucrative contracts from several top-name labels in order to establish her own New York-based company .
Entertainment lawyers can be used by some to look over any contract before it is signed .
Depending on the ideals of the net label , music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via Paypal or an online payment system .
This approach has been around since the early 1980s , in an attempt to stay true to the punk ideals of doing it yourself and not selling out to corporate profits and control .
In the 1990s , as a result of the widespread use of home studios , consumer recording technology , and the Internet , independent labels began to become more commonplace .
Often the record label &apos; s decisions are prudent ones from a commercial perspective , but this typically frustrates the artist who feels that their artwork is being diminished or misrepresented by such actions .
These are inspired by the free software and open source movements and the success of GNU \ / Linux .
Most net labels acknowledge the Creative Commons licensing system thus reserving certain rights for the artist .
The new century brings the phenomenon of open-source or open-content record label .
Some independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases , purchase the label completely .
Constant touring resulted in noteworthy success for an act without significant major funding .
The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible .
Ani and others from the company have spoken on several occasions about their business model in hopes of encouraging others .
There are many independent labels ; folk singer Ani DiFranco &apos; s Righteous Babe Records is often cited as an ideal example .
In the 1940s , 1950s and 1960s , many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they usually ended up signing a bad contract , sometimes giving away the rights to their music in the process .
Although both parties need each other to survive , the relationship between record labels and artists can be a difficult one .
In the 1970s and 1980s , there was a phase of consolidation in the record industry that led to almost all major labels being owned by a very few multinational companies .
On the punk rock scene , the DIY ethic encourages bands to self-publish and self-distribute .

In Mexico , about 14 % of the overwintering Monarchs are eaten by birds and mice .
The body turns black shortly after .
Parasites include the tachinid flies Sturmia convergens and Lesperia archippivora .
Overwintering Monarchs in Mexico are often preyed upon by Black-headed Grosbeaks which are immune to that toxin .
The Monarch has also been noticed puddling at an oil stain on pavement .
The caterpillar is banded with yellow , black , and white stripes .
The monarch is the state insect of Alabama , Idaho , Illinois , Minnesota , Texas , and the state butterfly of Vermont and West Virginia .
Adult Monarchs have been seen on a number of different nectar plants .
Generally it is only about 1 % or less of all monarchs , but has maintained populations as high as 10 % on Oahu in Hawaii , possibly due to selective predation .
The Monarch can be found in a wide range of habitats such as fields , meadows , prairie remnants , urban and suburban parks , gardens , and roadsides .
In North America , the Monarch ranges from southern Canada to northern South America .
In North America they make massive southward migrations starting in August until the first frost .
It overwinters in conifer groves .
But no single individual makes the entire round trip .
A northward migration takes place in the spring .
Over time , overwintering adults become less poisonous , thus making them more vulnerable to predators .
The head is also striped with yellow and black .
Others enjoy raising them for pleasure or for educational purposes .
The caterpillar will reach a length of 5 cm -LRB- 2 in -RRB- .
Monarchs in Hawaii are known to have low cardiac glycoside levels , but the birds may also be tolerant for the chemical .

Other birds such as orioles and jays have learned to eat only the thoracic muscles and abdominal contents because these contain less poison than the rest of the body .
It rarely strays to western Europe -LRB- rarely as far as Greece -RRB- from being transported by U. S. ships or by flying there if weather and wind conditions are right .

In her youth Fitzgerald wanted to be a dancer , although she loved listening to jazz recordings by Louis Armstrong , Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters .
In January 1935 , Fitzgerald won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House .
She had even gone as far as furnishing an apartment in Oslo , but the affair was quickly forgotten when Larsen was sentenced to five months hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman to whom he had previously been engaged .
The advent of bebop led to new developments in Fitzgerald &apos; s vocal style , influenced by her work with Dizzy Gillespie &apos; s big band . It was in this period that Fitzgerald started including scat singing as a major part of her performance repertoire .

After infection with the disease , the body -LRB- usually -RRB- gains the ability of recognizing the similar smallpox virus from its antigens and so is able to fight the smallpox disease much more efficiently .
Cowpox was the original vaccine of sorts for smallpox .
Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized , pustular lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introduction .
Cowpox is similar to but much milder than the highly contagious and sometimes deadly smallpox disease . It resembles mild smallpox , and was the basis of the first smallpox vaccines .
Human cases today are very rare and most often contracted from domestic cats .
The incubation period is nine to ten days .
It is from these rodents that domestic cats contract the virus .
Symptoms in cats include lesions on the face , neck , forelimbs , and paws , and less commonly upper respiratory tract infection .
The vaccinia virus now used for smallpox vaccination is sufficiently different from the cowpox virus found in the wild as to be considered a separate virus .
Cowpox is a skin disease caused by a virus known as the Cowpox virus .
The virus is prevalent in late summer and autumn .
The cowpox virus was used to perform the first successful vaccination against a disease , smallpox , which is caused by the related Variola virus .

In normalized scientific notation , the exponent b is chosen such that the absolute value of a remains at least one but less than ten -LRB- 1 â a -LRB- 10 -RRB- .
Scientific notation , also known as standard form or as exponential notation , is a way of writing numbers that accommodates values too large or small to be conveniently written in standard decimal notation .
-LRB- `` a times ten to the power of b &apos; &apos; -RRB- , where the exponent b is an integer , and the coefficient a is any real number -LRB- but see normalized notation below -RRB- , called the significand or mantissa -LRB- though the term `` mantissa &apos; &apos; may cause confusion as it can also refer to the fractional part of the common logarithm -RRB- .
Scientific notation has a number of useful properties and is commonly used in calculators , and by scientists , mathematicians , doctors , and engineers .
This form allows easy comparison of two numbers of the same sign in a , as the exponent b gives the number &apos; s order of magnitude .

Bodybuilders use weight training to develop their muscles for size , shape , and symmetry regardless of any increase in strength for competition in bodybuilding contests ; they train to maximize their muscular size and develop extremely low levels of body fat .
Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement .
Although weight training is similar to bodybuilding , they have different objectives .
In contrast , many weight trainers train to improve their strength and anaerobic endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat far below normal .
Weight training is a common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles .
However , as with any form of exercise , improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury .
Weight training , however , is often part of the athlete &apos; s training regimen .
By increasing muscular strength and improving balance , weight training can reduce falls by elderly persons as well .
It uses the force of gravity -LRB- in the form of weighted bars , dumbbells or weight stacks -RRB- to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction .
Weight training differs from bodybuilding , Olympic weightlifting , powerlifting , and strongman , which are sports rather than forms of exercise .
Weight training also strengthens bones , helping to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis .
Weight training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are slow , controlled , and carefully defined .
Boiry-Becquerelle is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France .
This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on .
Adaptive radiations commonly follow mass extinctions : following an extinction , many niches are left vacant .
Birds find other ways to provide for each other , i.e. the evolution of flight opened new avenues for evolution to explore , initiating an adaptive radiation .
The colonizing population may diversify rapidly to take advantage of all possible niches .
A classic example is the evolution of a fourth cusp is the mammalian tooth .
Adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism arising in an environment with unoccupied niches , such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain .
Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of ecological niches available to mammals .
In Lake Victoria , an isolated lake which formed recently in the African rift valley , over 300 species of cichlid fish adaptively radiated from one parent species in just 15,000 years .
A classic example of this is the replacement of the non-avian dinosaurs with mammals at the end of the Cretaceous , and of brachiopods by bivalves at the Permo-Triassic boundary .
The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the Cenozoic , and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation .

There are examples of episodes , ostensibly having been the `` season finale &apos; &apos; , unexpectedly becoming the de facto series finale due to the cancellation of the series .
A season finale may contain a cliffhanger ending to be resolved in the next season .
Alternatively , a season finale could bring open-ended storylines to a close , `` going out on a high &apos; &apos; and similarly maintaining interest in the series &apos; eventual return .
This is often the final episode to be produced for a few months or longer , and , as such , will try to attract viewers to continue watching when the series begins again .
The final episode of a television series often concludes the entire premise of the show .
In American English , the term has developed to describe the final event of a sporting season , e.g. in soccer or Motocross , perhaps partly because of the popularity of these with television viewers .
Recent examples of this include John Doe , Invasion , Two Guys and a Girl , Instant Star , Las Vegas , Everybody Hates Chris , The New Adventures of Old Christine , and Heroes .

The Vampire Squid reaches a maximum total length of around 30 cm -LRB- 1 ft -RRB- .
What behavioural data known has been gleaned from ephemeral encounters with ROVs ; animals are often damaged during capture and survive for no more than about two months in aquaria .
Few specifics are known regarding the ontogeny of the Vampire Squid .
Unique retractile sensory filaments justify the Vampire Squid &apos; s placement in its own order : Vampyromorphida -LRB- formerly Vampyromorpha -RRB- , which shares similarities with both squid and octopuses .
Like many deep-sea cephalopods , Vampire Squid lack ink sacs .
Until fairly recently known only from the modern species and some fossil remains tentatively allocated to this group , a batch of Middle Jurassic -LRB- Lower Callovian , c.165-164 mya -RRB- specimens found at La Voulte-sur-Rh Ã ne demonstrated that clearly vampyromorphid cephalopods were in existence for far longer than has been hitherto believed .
The animals have weak musculature but maintain agility and buoyancy with little effort thanks to sophisticated statocysts -LRB- balancing organs akin to a human &apos; s inner ear -RRB- and ammonium-rich gelatinous tissues closely matching the density of the surrounding seawater .
The Vampire Squid is an extreme example of a deep-sea cephalopod , thought to reside at aphotic -LRB- lightless -RRB- depths from 600-900 metres -LRB- 2,000-3 , 000 feet -RRB- or more .
Once she does , she may need to brood over them for up to 400 days before they hatch .
If a predator were to bite off an arm tip , the Vampire Squid can regenerate it .
Their blue blood &apos; s hemocyanin binds and transports oxygen more efficiently than in other cephalopods -LRB- Seibel et al . 1999 -RRB- , aided by gills with especially large surface area .
`` vampire squid from ` Hell &apos; &apos; &apos; -RRB- is a small , deep-sea cephalopod found throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world .
Copepods , prawns and cnidarians have all been reported as prey of Vampire Squid .
Appearing as small white discs , the photophores are larger and more complex at the tips of the arms and at the base of the two fins , but are absent from the underside of the caped arms .
To cope with life in the suffocating depths , vampire squid have developed several radical adaptations .
Hatchlings are c . 8 mm in length and are well-developed miniatures of the adults , with some differences .
The Vampyromorphida are characterized by such apomorphies as the possession of photophores , a peculiar type of uncalcified endoskeleton called `` gladius &apos; &apos; , 8 webbed arms and the 2 velar filaments .
As a phylogenetic relict it is the only known surviving member of its order , first described and originally classified as an octopus in 1903 by German teuthologist Carl Chun , but later assigned to a new order together with several extinct taxa .
They are capable of swimming at speeds equivalent to two body lengths per second , with an acceleration time of five seconds .
The chromatophores -LRB- pigment organs -RRB- common to most cephalopods are poorly developed in Vampire Squid .
A webbing of skin connects its eight arms , each lined with rows of fleshy spines or cirri ; the inside of this `` cloak &apos; &apos; is black .
Nonetheless , the Vampire Squid is able to live and breathe normally in the OMZ at oxygen saturations as low as 3 % ; a feat no other cephalopod , and few other animals , can claim .
Within the OMZ oxygen saturation is too low to support aerobic metabolism in most higher organisms .
Within the webbing are two pouches wherein the tactile velar filaments are concealed .
The female may store a male &apos; s hydraulically implanted spermatophore -LRB- a tapered , cylindrical satchel of sperm -RRB- for long periods before she is ready to fertilize her eggs .
At the shallower end of the Vampire Squid &apos; s vertical range , the view from below is like the sky at twilight : The highly sensitive eyes of deepwater denizens are able to distinguish the silhouettes of other animals moving overhead .
The filaments are analogous to a true squid &apos; s tentacles , extending well past the arms ; however , they are a different arm pair than the squid &apos; s tentacles .
If hypotheses may be drawn from knowledge of other deep-sea cephalopods , the Vampire Squid likely reproduces slowly by way of a small number of large eggs .
Their beak-like jaws are white .
Instead , the filaments are the same pair that were lost by the ancestral octopuses .
Their arms lack webbing , their eyes are smaller and their velar filaments are not fully formed .
A pair of photoreceptors are located on top of its head , perhaps alerting the animal to movements above .
The glowing arm tips are clustered together far above the animal &apos; s head , diverting attack away from critical areas .
Only the distal half -LRB- farthest from the body -RRB- of the arms have suckers .
The Vampire Squid is almost entirely covered in light-producing organs called photophores .
Its 15 cm -LRB- 6 inch -RRB- gelatinous body varies in color between velvety jet-black and pale reddish , depending on location and lighting conditions .
Of all deep-sea cephalopods , their mass-specific metabolic rate is the lowest .
Little else is known regarding their feeding habits , but considering their environment , they are likely to be opportunists .
Its own large eyes detect even the faintest of gleams .
The vampire squid -LRB- Vampyroteuthis infernalis , lit .
If the filaments contact an entity , or if vibrations impinge upon them , the animals investigate with rapid acrobatic movements .
This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past , with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families -LRB- Young 2002 -RRB- .
Within this region of the world &apos; s oceans is a discrete habitat known as the oxygen minimum zone -LRB- OMZ -RRB- .
The intensity and size of the photophores can also be modulated .
Whereas the young propel themselves primarily by jet propulsion , mature adults find flapping their fins to be the most efficient means -LRB- Seibel et al . 1998 -RRB- .
The supposed vampyromorphids from the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian -LRB- 156-146 mya -RRB- of Solnhofen , Plesioteuthis prisca , Leptoteuthis gigas , and Trachyteuthis hastiformis , can not be positively assigned to this group ; they are large species -LRB- from 35 cm in P. prisca to -RRB- 1 meter in L. gigas -RRB- and show features not found in vampyromorphids , being somewhat similar to the true squids , Teuthida -LRB- Fischer &amp; Riou 2002 -RRB- .
The smaller animals frequent much deeper waters , perhaps feeding on marine snow -LRB- falling organic detritus -RRB- .
Given their low metabolic rate and the low density of prey at such depths , Vampire Squid must use innovative predator avoidance tactics to conserve energy .
Its limpid , globular eyes , which appear red or blue , depending on lighting , are proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom at 2.5 cm -LRB- 1 inch -RRB- in diameter .
The vastness of their habitat and its sparse population make procreative encounters a fortuitous event .
With their long velar filaments deployed , Vampire Squid have been observed drifting along in the deep , black ocean currents .
If threatened , instead of ink , a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light is ejected from the arm tips .
This luminous barrage , which may last nearly 10 minutes , is presumably meant to daze would-be predators and allow the Vampire Squid to disappear into the blackness without the need to swim far .
These fins serve as the adult &apos; s primary means of propulsion : vampire squid `` fly &apos; &apos; through the water by flapping their fins .
The animal has great control over the organs , capable of producing disorienting flashes of light for fractions of a second to several minutes in duration .
The display is made only if the animal is very agitated ; regenerating the mucus is costly from a metabolic point of view .
These were described as Vampyronassa rhodanica .
The hatchlings are transparent and survive on a generous internal yolk for an unknown period before they begin to actively feed .
While this means the animal is not capable of changing its skin color in the dramatic fashion of shallow-dwelling cephalopods , such trickery is not needed at the lightless depths where it lives .
An artificial environment makes reliable observation of non-defensive behavior difficult .
However , their weak muscles limit stamina considerably .
As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops , the fins are resized and repositioned to maximize gait efficiency .
Two larger white areas on top of the head were initially believed to also be photophores , but have turned out to be photoreceptors .
Their aforementioned bioluminescent `` fireworks &apos; &apos; are combined with the writhing of glowing arms , erratic movements and escape trajectories , making it difficult for a predator to home in .
The female will not eat towards this culmination and dies shortly thereafter .
Mature adults have a pair of ear-like fins projecting from the lateral sides of the mantle .
Unlike their relatives living in more hospitable climes , deep-sea cephalopods can not afford to expend energy in protracted flight .
Vampire Squid have been found among the stomach contents of large deepwater fish , deep diving whales , and pinnipeds such as sea lions .
Growth is slow as nutrients are not abundant at depths frequented by the animals .
To combat this , the vampire squid generates its own bluish light -LRB- bioluminescence -RRB- in a strategy called counterillumination : The light diffuses the animal &apos; s silhouette , effectively `` cloaking &apos; &apos; its presence from the watchful eyes below .
Their development progresses through three morphologic forms : the very young animals have a single pair of fins , an intermediate form has two pairs , and the mature form again has one .
In a threat response called `` pumpkin &apos; &apos; or `` pineapple posture &apos; &apos; , the Vampire Squid inverts its caped arms back over the body , presenting an ostensibly larger form covered in fearsome-looking though harmless spines -LRB- called cirri -RRB- The underside of the cape is heavily pigmented , masking most of the body &apos; s photophores .

Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network , decryption is easy ; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse .
The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly , so quickly that the cipher was broken at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel .
Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on DES , their main change being that the data block is not split into equal halves in the Feistel network . Instead , 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function , whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block .
MacGuffin &apos; s key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself .
In cryptography , MacGuffin is a block cipher created in 1994 by Bruce Schneier and Matt Blaze at a Fast Software Encryption workshop .
Schneier and Blaze recommended using 32 rounds , and specified MacGuffin with a 128-bit key .
Rijmen and Preneel tried attacking MacGuffin with different S-boxes , taken directly from DES . This version proved to be slightly stronger , but they warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle .

With Wilma , the 2005 hurricane season broke the record for most storms in a season previously held by the 1933 season .
The depression drifted southwestward because of the influence of two ridges to its north and with warm water temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment it strengthened into Tropical Storm Wilma on October 17 .
Wilma crossed the state in about 4.5 hours and weakened to winds of 110 mph -LRB- 175 km \ / h -RRB- after entering the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter , Florida .
Hurricane Wilma was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin .

Plutarch -LRB- AD 46 â `` 120 -RRB- wrote that during his visit to Alexandria in 48 BC Julius Caesar accidentally burned the library down when he set fire to his own ships to frustrate Achillas &apos; attempt to limit his ability to communicate by sea .
According to the earliest source of information , the pseudepigraphic Letter of Aristeas , the library was initially organized by Demetrius of Phaleron , a student of Aristotle , under the reign of Ptolemy Soter -LRB- ca .367 BCâ &apos; &apos; ca .283 BC -RRB- .
King Ptolemy II Philadelphus -LRB- 309 â `` 246 BC -RRB- is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library .
A single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls , and this division into self-contained `` books &apos; &apos; was a major aspect of editorial work .
However , the exact layout is not known .
As the same text often existed in several different versions , comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their veracity .
It did so through an aggressive and well-funded royal mandate involving trips to the book fairs of Rhodes and Athens and a policy of pulling the books off every ship that came into port .
The first known library of its kind to gather a serious collection of books from beyond its country &apos; s borders , the Library at Alexandria was charged with collecting all the world &apos; s knowledge .
The Royal Library of Alexandria , or Ancient Library of Alexandria , in Alexandria , Egypt , was the largest and most significant great library of the ancient world .
No index of the library survives , and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been .
It flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC .
These included , among others ,
Intended both as a commemoration and an emulation of the original , the Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002 near the site of the old library .
Ptolemy happily paid the fee but kept the original scripts for the library .
This detail is informed by the fact that Alexandria , because of its man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the Pharos island , welcomed trade from the East and West , and soon found itself the international hub for trade , as well as the leading producer of papyrus and , soon enough , books .
By decree of Ptolemy III of Egypt , all visitors to the city were required to surrender all books and scrolls , as well as any form of written media in any language in their possession which , according to Galen , were listed under the heading `` books of the ships &apos; &apos; .
It was rumored that carved into the wall above the shelves , a famous inscription read : The place of the cure of the soul .
As a research institution , the library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics , astronomy , physics , natural sciences and other subjects .
Once ascertained , canonical copies would then be made for scholars , royalty and wealthy bibliophiles the world over , this commerce bringing income to the library .
Its empirical standards applied in one of the first and certainly strongest homes for serious textual criticism .
The editors at the Library of Alexandria are especially well known for their work on Homeric texts .
This process also helped to create a reservoir of books in the relatively new city .
This model &apos; s influence may still be seen today in the layout of university campuses .
Papyrus scrolls comprised the collection , and although parchment codices were used after 300 BC , the Alexandrian Library is never documented as having switched to parchment , perhaps because of its strong links to the papyrus trade .
A hall contained shelves for the collections of scrolls -LRB- as the books were at this time on papyrus scrolls -RRB- , known as bibliothekai -LRB- Î Î Î Î &apos; &apos; Î Î Î á Î Î Î -RRB- .
The more famous editors generally also held the title of head librarian .
A possibly apocryphal or exaggerated story concerns how the library &apos; s collection grew so large .
According to Galen , Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original scripts of Aeschylus , Sophocles and Euripides , for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen talents -LRB- 450 kg of a precious metal -RRB- as guarantee .
The library itself is known to have had an acquisitions department -LRB- possibly built near the stacks , or for utility closer to the harbor -RRB- , and a cataloguing department .
Built in the Brucheion -LRB- Royal Quarter -RRB- in the style of Aristotle &apos; s Lyceum , adjacent to and in service of the Musaeum -LRB- a Greek Temple or `` House of Muses &apos; &apos; , hence the term `` museum &apos; &apos; -RRB- , the library comprised a Peripatos walk , gardens , a room for shared dining , a reading room , lecture halls and meeting rooms .
Mark Antony supposedly gave Cleopatra over 200,000 scrolls -LRB- taken from the great Library of Pergamum -RRB- for the library as a wedding gift , but this is regarded by some historians as a propagandist claim meant to show Antony &apos; s allegiance to Egypt rather than Rome .
Official scribes then swiftly copied these writings , some copies proving so precise that the originals were put into the library , and the copies delivered to the unsuspecting owners .
They kept the original texts and made copies to send back to their owners .

Inside the plastic casing is a small printed circuit board .
As of software revision 21 -LRB- R21 -RRB- , players can also store custom songs and play them on any machine on which this feature is enabled .
In addition , many home Hi-Fi and car stereo head units are now equipped with a USB port .
Many of the smallest players are powered by a permanently fitted rechargeable battery , charged from the USB interface .
To address this , as well as space limitations , some developers have produced special versions of operating systems -LRB- such as Linux in Live USB -RRB- or commonplace applications -LRB- such as Mozilla Firefox -RRB- designed to run from flash drives .
In addition to five high-bitrate MP3s , it also included a video , pictures , lyrics , and guitar tablature .
Subsequently artists including Kanye West , Nine Inch Nails , Kylie Minogue and Ayumi Hamasaki have released music and promotional material on USB flash drives .
This should be a consideration when using a flash drive to run application software or an operating system .
One end of the device is fitted with a single male type-A USB connector .
In the arcade game In the Groove and more commonly In The Groove 2 , flash drives are used to transfer high scores , screenshots , dance edits , and combos throughout sessions .
Some computers can boot up from flash drives .
Compared to hard drives , flash drives use little power , have no fragile moving parts , and for most capacities are small and light .
Examples include the Creative MuVo , Philips GoGear and the first generation iPod shuffle .
The drive is used as a backup medium : at the close of business each night , the drive is inserted , and a database backup is saved to the drive .
In the arcade games Pump it Up NX2 and Pump it Up NXA , a special produced flash drive is used as a `` save file &apos; &apos; for unlocked songs , as well as progressing in the WorldMax and Brain Shower sections of the game .
Channel Five &apos; s Gadget Show cooked one of these flash drives with propane , froze it with dry ice , submerged it in various acidic liquids , ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar .
Digital audio files can be transported from one computer to another like any other file , and played on a compatible media player -LRB- with caveats for DRM-locked files -RRB- .
Many companies make small solid-state digital audio players , essentially producing flash drives with sound output and a simple user interface .
Leaving such a flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it has been known to result in a working drive with no future problems .
Mounted on this board is some power circuitry and a small number of surface-mounted integrated circuits -LRB- ICs -RRB- .
The majority of flash drives use USB , but some flash drives use other interfaces , such as IEEE1394 -LRB- FireWire -RRB- , one of their theoretical advantages when compared to USB drives being the minimal latency and CPU utilisation that the IEEE1394 protocol provides , but in practice because of the prevalence of the USB interfaces all IEEE1394-based flash drives that have appeared used old slow flash memory chips and no manufacturer sells IEEE1394 flash drives with modern fast flash memory as of 2009 , and the currently available models go up only to 4 GB , 8 GB or 16 GB , depending on the manufacturer .
Data stored on flash drives is impervious to scratches and dust , and flash drives are mechanically very robust making them suitable for transporting data from place to place and keeping it readily at hand .
Artists have sold or given away USB flash drives , with the first instance believed to be in 2004 when the German band WIZO released the `` Stick EP &apos; &apos; , only as a USB drive .
While use of flash drives is common , the drive must be Linux compatible .

Often , a major surgical -LRB- excisional or open -RRB- biopsy can be avoided by performing a needle aspiration biopsy instead .
A recent study showed that in one case a needle biopsy of a liver tumor resulted in spread of the cancer along the path of the needle , and concluded that needle aspiration was dangerous and unnecessary .
Fine needle aspiration biopsies are very safe , minor surgical procedures .
In this technique , a thin , hollow needle is inserted into the mass to extract cells that , after being stained , will be examined under a microscope .
Needle aspiration biopsy -LRB- NAB -RRB- , also known as fine needle aspiration cytology -LRB- FNAC -RRB- , fine needle aspiration biopsy -LRB- FNAB -RRB- and fine needle aspiration -LRB- FNA -RRB- , is a diagnostic procedure sometimes used to investigate superficial -LRB- just under the skin -RRB- lumps or masses .

&apos; is the provisional designation of an object seen orbiting Saturn just beyond the outer strand of the F ring on June 21 , 2004 .
If a solid object after all , would be 3 â &apos; 5 km in diameter based on brightness , and might be a shepherd satellite for the outer edge of Saturn &apos; s F ring .
Notably , an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on November 15 , 2004 failed to recover the object .
It was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Science Team in images taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on June 21 , 2004 and announced on September 9 , 2004 .
Another object , , was sighted nearby 5 hours later , but this time just inside the F Ring .
Because of the differing localisation the second object was given a fresh designation , although their interpretation as a single object on a F-ring crossing orbit is also possible .
Such an object might also be orbiting at a slightly different inclination to the F ring , thereby not actually passing through the ring material despite being seen both radially inward and outward of it .
This suggests that it was a temporary clump of material that had disappeared by that time .

Placard and posters existed from the ancient times .
For the graphic designers who intend to convey a message with a minimum interference from the extraneous elements his experiment in minimalism was a valuable gift .
Unfortunately , the high cost sophisticated printing processes can only be afforded mostly by the government entities and large corporations .
This history together with the history of writing which was emerged in 3000-4000 BC are at the foundation of the Graphic Art .
This style of presentation at the time was called the Viennese method , but now it is known as ISOTYPE charts -LRB- International System of Typographic Picture Education -RRB- .

He attended Newman College and the University of Western Australia , where he received a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery in 1975 .
Marshall was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007 .
Interestingly , Marshall did not develop antibodies to H. pylori , suggesting that innate immunity can sometimes eradicate acute H. pylori infection .
He met Robin Warren , a pathologist interested in gastritis , during internal medicine fellowship training at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981 .
After his work at Fremantle Hospital , Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital -LRB- 1985-86 -RRB- and at the University of Virginia , USA -LRB- 1986-Present -RRB- , before returning to Australia while remaining on the faculty of the University of Virginia .
This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia , and is among the most cited articles from the journal .
Marshall is well-known for proving that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori -LRB- H. pylori -RRB- is the cause of most peptic ulcers , reversing decades of medical doctrine holding that ulcers were caused by stress , spicy foods , and too much acid .
In 1979 , Marshall was appointed as a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital .
It has been claimed that the H. pylori theory was ridiculed by the establishment scientists and doctors , who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach .
Together , the pair studied the presence of spiral bacteria in association with gastritis .
Symptoms included vague stomach discomfort , nausea , vomiting and halitosis -LRB- due to the achlorhydia , there was no acid to kill bacteria in the stomach , and their waste products manifested as bad breath -RRB- .

Certainly , an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take attempts if each key is n bits long , compared to the attempts required for a single key .
Diffie and Hellman , however , devised a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme .
where E is the encryption function -LRB- cipher -RRB- , and K1 and K2 are the two keys .
When trying to improve the security of a block cipher , one might get the idea to simply use two independent keys to encrypt the data twice . Naively , one might think that this would square the security of the double-encryption scheme .
The attacker can then compute EK -LRB- P -RRB- for all possible keys K and store the results in memory .
Assume the attacker knows a set of plaintext and ciphertext : P and C. That is , ,
Afterwards he can decrypt the ciphertext by computing DK -LRB- C -RRB- for each K. Any matches between these two resulting sets are likely to reveal the correct keys .
It was first developed as an attack on an attempted expansion of a block cipher by Diffie and Hellman in 1977 .
While the birthday attack attempts to find two values in the domain of a function that map to the same value in its range , the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to find a value in each of the range and domain of the composition of two functions such that the forward mapping of one through the first function is the same as the inverse image of the other through the second function -- quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function .
The meet-in-the-middle attack is a cryptographic attack which , like the birthday attack , makes use of a space-time tradeoff .
-LRB- To speed up the comparison , the EK -LRB- P -RRB- set is stored in an in-memory lookup table , then each DK -LRB- C -RRB- can be matched against the values in the lookup table to find the candidate keys . -RRB-
If the keysize is n , this attack uses only encryptions -LRB- and space -RRB- in contrast to the naive attack , which needs encryptions -LRB- but only space -RRB- .
Once the matches are discovered , they can be verified with a second test-set of plaintext and ciphertext .
The attack works by encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end , thus meeting in the middle .

IE versions , over time , have had widely varying OS compatibility , ranging from being available for many platforms and several versions of Windows to only a few versions of Windows .
In IE7 and later , when the cache is cleared , the cache files are more reliably removed , and the index .
Patches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service , as well as through Automatic Updates .
During the heyday of the browser wars , Internet Explorer superseded Netscape only when it caught up technologically to support the progressive features of the time .
Since the add-ons have a more privileged access to the system , malicious add-ons can and have been used to compromise the security of the system .
The result is that later versions of IE6 had many more users in total than all the early versions put together .
However , to prevent compatibility issues , IE8 also includes the IE7 rendering behavior .

The song received critical acclaim for Adele &apos; s powerful vocals , the powerful set of lyrics and the song &apos; s instrumentation .
Lipshutz also praised Adele &apos; s vocal performance by writing , `` Adele &apos; s noticeable leap in vocal confidence highlights the track .
The song debuted at number two in the United Kingdom , becoming Adele &apos; s third top ten single .
It was released as the lead single on 29 November 2010 in the Netherlands .
The song was written by Adele and Paul Epworth and has been described by Adele as a `` dark blues-y gospel disco tune &apos; &apos; .
Rolling Stones Barry Walters gave the song a positive review stating &apos; &apos; `` Rolling in the Deep &apos; &apos; finds the 22-year-old in bluesy gospel mode , sounding powerful but not particularly pop .
Jason Lipshutz from Billboard complimented the song &apos; s `` sweeping chorus &apos; &apos; and felt that the song `` places a similar emphasis on its refrain but its multilayered instrumentation gives the English singer &apos; s wail a previously unheard depth . &apos; &apos;

It was established in the 17th century as a trading post for the English East India Company , but later grew to encompass much of western and central India , as well as parts of post-partition Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula .
During the 18th century , the Hindu Maratha Empire expanded rapidly , claiming Konkan and much of eastern Gujarat from the disintegrating Mughal Empire .
In Sindh Islam had been the predominant religion from the Arab conquest in the 8th century .
The first conflict between the British and the Marathas was the First Anglo-Maratha War which began in 1774 and resulted in the 1782 treaty of Salbai , by which the island of Salsette , adjacent to Bombay island , was ceded to the British , while Bharuch was ceded to the Maratha ruler Scindia .
The Konkan is notable for various Christian castes , owing their origin to Portuguese rule ; while in the Carnatic , Lingayatism , a Hindu reformation movement of the 12th century , was embraced by 45 % of the population .
British territory was enlarged in the Second Anglo-Maratha War which ended in 1803 .
In western Gujarat , including Kathiawar and Kutch , the loosening of Mughal control allowed numerous local rulers to create virtually independent states .
The census of 1901 gave a total of 25,468,209 .
In 1947 Bombay Province became part of newly-independent India , and Sindh Province became part of Pakistan .
So lightly was the acquisition esteemed in England and so unsuccessful was the administration of the crown officers , that in 1668 Bombay was transferred to the East India Company for an annual payment of Â # 10 .
In 1687 Bombay was placed at the head of all the Company &apos; s possessions in India ; but in 1753 the government of Bombay became subordinate to that of Calcutta .
The Bombay Presidency was a province of British India .
By religion the population was 19,916,438 Hindu , 4,567,295 Muslim , 535,950 Jain , 78,552 Zoroastrian , and approximately 200,000 Christian .
The Bombay Presidency had a large and diverse population .
The British annexed Surat in 1800 .
In Gujarat the predominant religion is Hinduism , although Muslim kingdoms have left their influence in many parts of the province .
The first English settlement in the Presidency known as Western Presidency was in 1618 at Surat , when the East India Company established a factory at Surat in present-day Gujarat , protected by a charter obtained from the Mughal Emperor Jahangir .
In 1950 Bombay Province was reorganized into Bombay State , which included the princely states formerly under the political authority of Bombay Province ; these princely states were merged into the new state after their rulers acceded to India .
The chief languages of the Presidency were Sindhi in Sindh , Kutchi in Kutch , Gujarati and Hindustani in Gujarat , Marathi in Thana and the central division , Gujarati and Marathi in Khandesh , and Marathi and Kannada in the southern division .
It consisted partly of districts , which were directly under British rule , and partly of native or princely states , which were ruled by local rulers under the administration of a governor .
At its greatest extent , the Bombay Presidency comprised the present-day state of Gujarat , the western two-thirds of Maharashtra state , including the regions of Konkan , Desh , and Kandesh , and northwestern Karnataka state of India ; It also included Pakistan &apos; s Sindh province and the British territory of Aden in Yemen .
In 1661 it was ceded to the English crown , as part of the dowry of the infanta Catherine of Braganza on her marriage with Charles II of England .

The name Tachyglossus means `` quick tongue &apos; &apos; , in reference to the speed with which the Echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites , and aculeatus means `` spiny &apos; &apos; or `` equipped with spines &apos; &apos; .
The subspecies also differ from one another in their hairiness , spine length and width , and the size of the grooming claws on their hind feet .
During courtship -- observed for the first time in 1989 -- males locate and pursue females .
Suckling gradually decreases until juveniles are weaned at about six months of age .
Many groups have myths about the animal ; one myth explains that it was created when a group of hungry young men went hunting at night and stumbled across a wombat .
The age of sexual maturity is uncertain , but may be four to five years .
The Short-beaked Echidna is an iconic animal in contemporary Australia , notably appearing on the Australian five-cent piece -LRB- the smallest denomination -RRB- , and on a $ 200 commemorative coin released in 1992 .
Little is known about their distribution in New Guinea . They have been found in southern New Guinea between Merauke in the west and the Kelp Welsh River , east of Port Moresby , in the east , where they may be found in open woodland .
The earholes are on either side of the head , with no external pinnae .
The protruded tongue is stiffened by the rapid flow of blood , allowing it to penetrate wood and soil .
The spines , which may be up to 50 m long , are modified hairs , mostly made of keratin .
The failure of captive breeding programs has conservation implications for the endangered species of echidna from the genus Zaglossus , and to a lesser extent for the Short-beaked Echidna .
The nostrils and the mouth are at the distal end of the snout ; the mouth of the Short-beaked Echidna can not open wider than 5 m . The body of the Short-beaked Echidna is , with the exception of the underside , face and legs , covered with cream-coloured spines .
It has one of the shortest spinal cords of any mammal , extending only as far as the thorax .
After prodding and sniffing her back , the male is often observed to roll the female onto her side and then assume a similar position himself so that the two animals are abdomen to abdomen , having dug a small crater to lie in .
The Short-beaked Echidna has been included in several postal issues : it was one of four native species to appear on Australian postage stamps in 1974 , when it was on the 25-cent stamp ; it appeared on a 37-cent stamp in 1987 , and in 1992 it was on the 35-cent stamp .
Ten days after it is laid , the egg hatches within the pouch .
Like the Platypus , the Echidna has a low body temperature -- between 30 a -- but , unlike the Platypus , which shows no evidence of torpor or hibernation , the body temperature of the Echidna may fall as low as 5 Â . The Echidna does not pant or sweat and normally seeks shelter in hot conditions .
The tongue of the Short-beaked Echidna is the animal &apos; s sole means of catching prey , and can protrude up to 180 m outside the snout .
The embryo develops an `` egg tooth &apos; &apos; during incubation , which it uses to tear open the egg ; the tooth disappears soon after hatching .
In cooler parts of their range , such as Tasmania , females may mate within a few hours of arousal from hibernation .
The Short-beaked Echidna was first described by George Shaw in 1792 .
Juveniles are eventually ejected from the pouch at around two to three months of age , because of the continuing growth in the length of their spines .
They threw spears at the wombat , but lost sight of it in the darkness .
Species of the Tachyglossidae are egg-laying mammals ; together with the related family Ornithorhynchidae , they are the only extant monotremes in the world .
It is not threatened with extinction , but human activities , such as hunting , habitat destruction , and the introduction of foreign predatory species and parasites , have reduced the distribution of the Short-beaked Echidna in Australia .
Because of the low body temperature of the Short-beaked Echidna , it becomes sluggish in very hot and very cold weather .
The Short-beaked Echidna has a well-developed olfactory system , which may be used to detect mates and prey .
Trains of up to ten males -- often with the youngest and smallest male at the end of the queue -- may follow a single female in a courtship ritual that may last for up to four weeks ; the duration of the courtship period varies with location .
Like the other extant monotremes , the Short-beaked Echidna lays eggs ; the monotremes are the only group of mammals to do so .
Following the gestation period , a single rubbery-skinned egg between 13 a in diameter and 1.5 a in weight is laid from her cloaca directly into a small , backward-facing pouch that has developed on her abdomen .
The anthropomorphic echidna Millie was a mascot for the 2000 Summer Olympics .
By contraction of various parts of the panniculus carnosus , the Short-beaked Echidna can change shape , the most characteristic shape change being achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened , so protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines .
The musculature of the Short-beaked Echidna has a number of unusual aspects .
They have been observed ingesting large amounts during each feeding period , and mothers may leave them unattended in the burrow for between five and ten days in order to find food .
In autumn and winter the Echidna shows periods of torpor or deep hibernation .
The brain and central nervous system of the Short-beaked Echidna have been extensively studied for evolutionary comparison with placental mammals , particularly with its fellow monotreme , the Platypus .
Before mating , the male smells the female , paying particular attention to the cloaca .
When the tongue is retracted , the prey is caught on backward-facing keratinous `` teeth &apos; &apos; , located along the roof of the buccal cavity , allowing the animal both to capture and grind food .
Short-beaked Echidnas can live anywhere that has a good supply of food .
The claws on the hind feet are elongated and curve backwards to enable cleaning and grooming between the spines .
The solitary Short-beaked Echidna looks for a mate between May and September ; the precise timing of the mating season varies with geographic location .
Short-beaked Echidnas feature in the animistic culture of indigenous Australians , including their visual arts and stories .
Protrusion of the tongue is achieved by contracting circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forwards and contracting two genioglossal muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the mandible .
Retraction requires the contraction of two internal longitudinal muscles , known as the sternoglossi .
The Echidna &apos; s fur may be infested with what is said to be the world &apos; s largest flea , Bradiopsylla echidnae , which is about 4 m long .
He named the species Myrmecophaga aculeata , thinking it might be related to the South American anteater .
It has a highly sensitive optic nerve , and has been shown to have visual discrimination and spatial memory comparable to those of a rat .
Gestation takes between 21 and 28 days after copulation , during which time the female constructs a nursery burrow .
The Short-beaked Echidna can live as long as 45 years in the wild , and the longest-lived echidna in captivity reached 49 years of age in a zoo in Philadelphia in the US .
The Short-beaked Echidna -LRB- Tachyglossus aculeatus -RRB- , also known as the Spiny Anteater because of its diet of ants and termites , is one of four living species of echidna and the only member of the genus Tachyglossus .
The tongue moves with great speed , and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute .
Fertilisation occurs in the oviduct .
The wombat adapted the spears for its own defense and turned into an Echidna .
In agricultural areas , they are most likely to be found in uncleared scrub ; they may be found in grassland , arid areas , and in the outer suburbs of the capital cities .
Colouration of the fur and spines varies with geographic location .
The tongue is sticky because of the presence of glycoprotein-rich mucous , which both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites , which adhere to it .
Each mating results in the production of a single egg , and females are known to mate only once during the breeding season ; each mating is successful .
In Australia they are most common in forested areas where there are abundant termite-filled fallen logs .
The panniculus carnosus is an enormous muscle that is just beneath the skin and covers the entire body .
Up until 2006 , only five zoos have managed to breed a captive Short-beaked Echidna , but no captive-bred young have survived to maturity .
Short-beaked Echidnas are typically 30 t in length , have a 75 m snout , and weigh between 2 a . However , the Tasmanian subspecies , T. a. setosus , is smaller than its Australian mainland counterparts .
The species is found throughout Australia , where it is the most widespread native mammal , and in coastal and highland regions of southwestern New Guinea , where it is known as the Mungwe in the Daribi and Chimbu languages .
Although it considered easy to keep Echidnas healthy in captivity , breeding is difficult , partly due to the relatively infrequent cycle .
They locate food by smell , using sensors in the tip of their snout , and regularly feast on ants and termites .
The duration of lactation is about 200 days , and the young leave the burrow after 180 to 205 days , usually in January or February , at which time they are around 800 a . There is no contact between the mother and young after this point .
The eyes are small , approximately a 9 m diameter sphere and at the base of the wedge-shaped snout .
Because the neck is not externally visible , the head and body appear to merge together .
Insulation is provided by fur between the spines , which ranges in color from honey to a dark reddish-brown and even black ; the underside and short tail are also covered in fur .
A twelve-year field study , published in 2003 , found that the Short-beaked Echidna reaches sexual maturity between five and twelve years of age , and that the frequency of reproduction varies from once every two years to once every six years .
The Short-beaked Echidna is the only member of its genus , sharing the family Tachyglossidae with the extant species of the genus Zaglossus that occur in New Guinea .
Another story tells of a greedy man who kept food from his tribe ; warriors speared him and he crawled away into the bushes , where he turned into an Echidna , the spears becoming his spines .
The species was a totem for some groups , including the Noongar people from Western Australia .
There are five subspecies of the Short-beaked Echidna , each found in a different geographical location .
The Short-beaked Echidna is covered in fur and spines and has a distinctive snout and a specialized tongue , which it uses to catch its prey at a great speed .

According to tradition , she discovered silk and invented the silk loom in the 27th century BC .
A fine thread started to separate itself from the cocoon .
She collected some cocoons , and then sat down to have some tea .
She is attributed with inventing the silk reel , which joins fine filaments into a thread strong enough for weaving .
She persuaded her husband to give her a grove of mulberry trees , where she could domesticate the worms that made these cocoons .
Leizu shared her discoveries with others and the knowledge became widespread in China .
Another says that she found silkworms eating the mulberry leaves and spinning cocoons .
Leizu found that she could unwind this soft and lovely thread around her finger .
She is also credited with inventing the first silk loom .
It is not known how much , if any , of this story is true , but historians do know that China was the first civilization to use silk .
While she was sipping a cup of tea , she dropped a cocoon into the steaming water .
Leizu was a legendary Chinese empress and wife of the Yellow Emperor .
When the silk ran out she saw a small cocoon and realized that this cocoon was the source of the silk .

In 1944 this `` transforming principle &apos; &apos; was identified as being genetic by Oswald Avery , Colin MacLeod , and Maclyn McCarty .
Griffith discovered that a harmless strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae could be made virulent after being exposed to heat-killed virulent strains .
Griffith hypothesized that some `` transforming principle &apos; &apos; from the heat-killed strain was responsible for making the harmless strain virulent .
They isolated DNA from a virulent strain of S. pneumoniae and using just this DNA were able to make a harmless strain virulent .
Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A. tumefaciens so other methods were developed including electroporation and micro-injection .
Transformation was first demonstrated in 1928 by British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith .
Transformation did not become routine procedure in laboratories until 1972 when Stanley Cohen , Annie Chang and Leslie Hsu successfully transformed Escherichia coli by treating the bacteria with calcium chloride .
Introduction of foreign DNA into eukaryotic cells is usually called `` transfection &apos; &apos; .
The results of Avery et al . &apos; s experiments were at first sceptically received by the scientific community and it was not until the development of genetic markers and the discovery of other methods of genetic transfer -LRB- conjugation in 1947 and transduction in 1953 -RRB- by Joshua Lederberg that Avery &apos; s experiments were accepted .
Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System -LRB- gene gun -RRB- by John Sanford in 1990 .
They called this uptake and incorporation of DNA by bacteria `` transformation . &apos; &apos;
By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the cancer and adding in novel genes researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants .
This created an efficient and convenient procedure for transforming bacteria and opened the way for molecular cloning in biotechnology and research .
Transformation may also be used to describe the insertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells including animal and plant cells , however , because transformation has a special meaning in relation to animal cells indicating progression to a cancerous state , the term should be avoided for animal cells when describing introduction of exogenous genetic material .
Transformation is one of three processes by which exogenous genetic material may be introduced into bacterial cell , the other two being conjugation -LRB- transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct contact -RRB- , and transduction -LRB- injection of foreign DNA by a bacteriophage into the host -RRB- .
In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors , Agrobacterium tumefaciens , was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid .

Elephants replace their teeth six times .
The African forest elephant has a longer and narrower mandible , rounder ears , a different number of toenails , straighter and downward tusks , and considerably smaller size .
As the front pair wears down and drops out in pieces , the back pair shifts forward , and two new molars emerge in the back of the mouth .
Fossil members of Loxodonta have only been found in Africa , where they developed in the middle Pliocene .
With regard to the number of toenails : the African bush elephant normally has four toenails on the front foot and three on the hind feet , the African forest elephant normally has five toenails on the front foot and four on the hind foot -LRB- like the Asian elephant -RRB- , but hybrids between the two species commonly occur .
An anonymous author romanized the spelling to Loxodonta and the ICZN recognizes this as the proper authority .
Although it is commonly believed that the genus was named by Georges Cuvier in 1825 , Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte .
African elephants are the species of elephants in the genus Loxodonta -LRB- Greek for ` oblique-sided tooth &apos; -RRB- , one of the two existing genera in Elephantidae .
Their tusks are teeth ; the second set of incisors become the tusks .
The African elephant nominally has governmental protection , but poaching for the ivory trade can devastate populations .
They are used for digging for roots and stripping the bark off trees for food , for fighting each other during mating season , and for defending themselves against predators .
Poaching significantly reduced the population of Loxodonta in certain regions during the 20th century .
At about 40 to 60 years of age , the elephant no longer has teeth and will likely die of starvation , a common cause of death .
Human encroachment into or adjacent to natural areas where bush elephants occur has led to recent research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans , including the discovery that playback of the recorded sounds of angry honey bees is remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area .
An example of how the ivory trade causes poaching pressure is in the eastern region of Chadâ &apos; &apos; elephant herds where as recently as 1970 there was an estimated population of 400,000 ; however , by 2006 the number had dwindled to about 10,000 .

DNA repair refers to a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome .
In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as UV light and radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day .
Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell &apos; s ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes .
The rate of DNA repair is dependent on many factors , including the cell type , the age of the cell , and the extracellular environment .
As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure .
Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell &apos; s genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis .

It is a C-type asteroid with a primitive surface .
Its rotation period is typical for large asteroids , but nothing is known of its axial tilt .
It was the first asteroid found from North America .
31 Euphrosyne is one of the largest main-belt asteroids , discovered by James Ferguson on September 1 , 1854 .
During a rare perihelic opposition Euphrosyne is very high in the sky from northern latitudes , but invisible from such countries as New Zealand and Chile .

The circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake , a small man-made lake just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne .
Albert Park also has the distinction of being the only venue to hold the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-World Championship formats .
Prior to the 1996 Australian Grand Prix , an earlier configuration of the current circuit was used for both the 1953 and 1956 Australian Grands Prix .
During this time Albert Park actually ran anti-clockwise as opposed to the current GP circuit which runs clockwise .
The course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive , drivers having commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times .
As a result , compared to other circuits that are held on public roads , the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface .

These were a later development , most likely used to help remember the correct letters -LRB- a backronym -RRB- .
With the development of audio radio transmitters , there was a need for a spoken distress phrase , and `` Mayday &apos; &apos; was adopted by the 1927 International Radio Convention as the equivalent of SOS .
On January 20 , 1914 , the London International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea adopted the Morse code signal TTT -LRB- â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; -RRB- , three letter T &apos; s -LRB- â &apos; &apos; -RRB- spaced correctly as three letters so as not to be confused with the letter O -LRB- â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; -RRB- , as the `` Safety Signal , &apos; &apos; used for messages to ships `` involving safety of navigation and being of an urgent character . &apos; &apos;
The fact that SOS can be read right side up as well as upside down became important for visual recognition if viewed from above .
This distress signal was first adopted by the German government in radio regulations effective April 1 , 1905 , and became the worldwide standard under the second International Radiotelegraphic Convention , which was signed on November 3 , 1906 and became effective on July 1 , 1908 .
In popular usage , SOS became associated with phrases such as `` save our ship &apos; &apos; or `` save our souls &apos; &apos; .
However , there was some resistance among the Marconi operators to the adoption of the new signal , and , as late as the April , 1912 sinking of the , the ship &apos; s Marconi operators intermixed CQD and SOS distress calls .
During the Second World War , additional codes were employed to include immediate details about attacks by enemy vessels , especially in the Battle of the Atlantic .
In both the April 1 , 1905 German law , and the 1906 International regulations , the distress signal was specified as a continuous Morse code sequence of three-dits \ / three-dahs \ / three-dits , with no mention of any alphabetic equivalents .
The signal SSS signalled attacked by submarines , whilst RRR warned of an attack by a surface raider , QQQ warned of an unknown raider -LRB- usually an auxiliary cruiser -RRB- , and AAA indicated an attack by aircraft .
However , in International Morse , three dits comprise the letter S , and three dahs the letter O. It therefore soon became common to refer to the distress signal as `` SOS . &apos; &apos;
Article XVI of the regulations adopted Germany &apos; s Notzeichen distress signal as the international standard , reading : `` Ships in distress shall use the following signal : Â Â Â â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; Â Â Â repeated at brief intervals &apos; &apos; .
-LRB- In American Morse code , which was used by many coastal ships in the United States through the first part of the twentieth century , three dahs stood for the numeral `` 5 &apos; &apos; , so in a few cases the distress signal was informally referred to as `` S5S &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
In International Morse Code , three dits form the letter S , and three dahs make the letter O , so `` SOS &apos; &apos; became an easy way to remember the correct order of the dits and dahs .
The use of the SOS signal was first introduced in Germany as part of a set of national radio regulations , effective April 1 , 1905 .
Thus , under the modern notation , the distress signal becomes SOS .
In order to designate the proper sequence of dits-and-dahs for a long special symbol , the standard practice is to list alphabetic characters which contain the same dits-and-dahs in the same order , with a bar atop the character sequence to indicate that there should not be any internal spaces in the transmission .
There was no problem as long as operators were aware that `` SOS &apos; &apos; was technically just a convenient way for remembering the proper sequence of the distress signal &apos; s total of nine dits and dahs .
In 1906 , at the second International Radiotelegraphic Convention in Berlin , an extensive collection of Service Regulations was developed to supplement the main agreement , which was signed on November 3 , 1906 , becoming effective on July 1 , 1908 .
In contrast to CQD , which was sent as three separate letters with spaces between each letter , the SOS distress call has always been transmitted as a continuous sequence of dits-and-dahs , and not as individual letters .
It has also sometimes been used as a visual distress signal , consisting of three short , three long , three short light flashes such as from a survival mirror , or with `` SOS &apos; &apos; spelled out in individual letters , for example , stamped in a snowbank or formed out of logs on a beach .
They were usually sent in conjunction with the SOS distress code .
These regulations introduced three new Morse code sequences , including the SOS distress signal .
In later years , the number of special Morse symbols increased .
SOS is the commonly used description for the international Morse code distress signal -LRB- Â Â Â â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; Â Â Â -RRB- .
-LRB- In International Morse , VTB , IJS and SMB , among others , would also correctly translate into the Â Â Â â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; Â Â Â distress call sequence , but traditionally only SOS is used -RRB- .
From the beginning , the SOS distress signal has really consisted of a continuous sequence of three-dits \ / three-dahs \ / three-dits , all run together without letter spacing .
The first ship to transmit an SOS distress call appears to have been the Cunard liner Slavonia on June 10 , 1909 , according to `` Notable Achievements of Wireless &apos; &apos; in the September , 1910 Modern Electrics .
In modern terminology , SOS is a Morse `` procedural signal &apos; &apos; or `` prosign &apos; &apos; , and the formal way to write it is with a bar above the letters , i.e. SOS .
An early report on `` The International Radio-Telegraphic Convention &apos; &apos; in the January 12 , 1907 Electrical World stated that `` Vessels in distress use the special signal , SOS , repeated at short intervals . &apos; &apos;

Rosalyn is Calvin &apos; s babysitter .
Watterson explains :
Named for the pet beagle of Watterson &apos; s wife &apos; s family , she appeared early in the strip as a new student in Calvin &apos; s class .
From the other characters &apos; perspectives , Hobbes is Calvin &apos; s stuffed tiger . From Calvin &apos; s point of view Hobbes is an anthropomorphic tiger , much larger than Calvin and full of independent attitudes and ideas .
Though both of them hate to admit it , Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common .
From Calvin &apos; s point of view Hobbes is an anthropomorphic tiger , much larger than Calvin and full of independent attitudes and ideas .
Hobbes is named after the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes , who held what Watterson describes as `` a dim view of human nature . &apos; &apos;
G.R.O.S.S. , which stands for Get Rid Of Slimy girlS , is a club which consists only of two members : Calvin and Hobbes .
Calvin &apos; s Uncle Max was in the strip for a week but could not refer to the parents by name , which was one of the main reasons Max never reappeared .
Hobbes often openly expresses romantic feelings for Susie , much to Calvin &apos; s disgust . Calvin starts a `` club &apos; &apos; -LRB- of which he and Hobbes are the only members -RRB- that he calls G.R.O.S.S. -LRB- Get Rid Of Slimy girlS -RRB- club , and while holding `` meetings &apos; &apos; in Calvin &apos; s treehouse or in the `` box of secrecy &apos; &apos; in Calvin &apos; s room , they usually come up with some way to annoy or socially maim Susie , most of which backfire on them completely .
Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club , Calvin being `` Dictator-for-Life &apos; &apos; and Hobbes being `` President-and-First-Tiger &apos; &apos; .
For example , Susie is shown on occasion with a stuffed bunny rabbit named `` Mr. Bun , &apos; &apos; and Calvin , of course , has Hobbes .
They hold meetings to attempt to annoy Susie Derkins .
Susie Derkins , the only important character with both a first and last name , is a classmate of Calvin &apos; s who lives on his street .
Watterson eventually decided that it was not important to establish how Calvin and Hobbes met .
Moe is the stereotypical bully character , a large , cruel , dimwitted `` six-year-old who shaves &apos; &apos; who shoves Calvin against walls or onto the ground while demanding his lunch money and calling him `` Twinky , &apos; &apos; `` Shrimp , &apos; &apos; `` Twerp , &apos; &apos; or `` Squirt . &apos; &apos;
Calvin and Hobbes is a syndicated daily comic strip that was written and illustrated by American cartoonist Bill Watterson , and syndicated from November 18 , 1985 , to December 31 , 1995 .
Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other , and that Susie is inspired by the type of woman whom Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married .
Watterson says , `` As far as the strip is concerned , they are important only as Calvin &apos; s mom and dad . &apos; &apos;
Watterson describes Moe as `` every jerk I &apos; ve ever known . &apos; &apos;
Both remain unnamed except as `` Mom &apos; &apos; and `` Dad , &apos; &apos; or pet names such as `` honey &apos; &apos; and `` dear &apos; &apos; between themselves .
Moe is the only regular character whose speech is shown in an unusual font : his frequently monosyllabic dialogue is shown in crude , lower-case letters .
Nearly 45 million copies of the 18 Calvin and Hobbes books have been sold .

Because of Dalton &apos; s work , the condition was often called daltonism , although this term is now used for a type of color blindness called deuteranopia .
Many of the genes involved in color vision are on the X chromosome , making color blindness more common in males than in females because males have only one X chromosome , while females have two .
In addition , some color blind people find it easier to distinguish problem colors on artificial materials , such as plastic or in acrylic paints , than on natural materials , such as paper or wood .
Good graphic design avoids using color coding or using color contrasts alone to express information ; this not only helps color blind people , but also aids understanding by normally sighted people .
Third , for some color blind people , color can only be distinguished if there is a sufficient `` mass &apos; &apos; of color : thin lines might appear black while a thicker line of the same color can be perceived as having color .
This is an important possibility to consider when designing , for example , emergency brake handles or emergency phones .
The English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific paper on this subject in 1798 , `` Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colors &apos; &apos; , after the realization of his own color blindness .
Total color blindness is much less common than partial color blindness .
There are many types of color blindness .
The most common are redâ `` green hereditary photoreceptor disorders , but it is also possible to acquire color blindness through damage to the retina , optic nerve , or higher brain areas .
Color blindness is usually classed as a mild disability , but in certain situations , color blind individuals have an advantage over those with normal color vision .

Various species have evolved to not only blend with the foliage , but to mimic it , appearing as either living or withered leaves , sticks , tree bark , blades of grass , flowers , or even stones .
Mantises are camouflaged , and most species make use of protective coloration to blend in with the foliage or substrate , both to avoid predators themselves , and to better snare their victims .
In Europe , the name `` praying mantis &apos; &apos; refers to Mantis religiosa .
Mantises have two grasping , spiked forelegs -LRB- `` raptorial legs &apos; &apos; -RRB- in which prey items are caught and held securely . The first thoracic segment , the prothorax , is commonly elongated and flexibly articulated , allowing for greater range of movement of the front limbs , while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile .
The mantis then lashes out at remarkable speed .
As their hunting relies heavily on vision , they are primarily diurnal , but many species will fly at night .
Some ground and bark species , however , pursue their prey rather quickly .
The majority of mantises are ambush predators , waiting for prey to stray too near .

Zambia , formerly Northern Rhodesia , took a pragmatic approach towards Rhodesia .
Throughout its history , Rhodesia continued to be referred to by the British , who did not recognize the state , as `` Southern Rhodesia &apos; &apos; . Before 1964 , the name `` Rhodesia &apos; &apos; had referred to the territory consisting of Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia which formed the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland .
It consisted of modern Zambia , Zimbabwe , and Malawi ; however , when the former colony of Northern Rhodesia renamed itself Zambia on independence in 1964 , Nyasaland renamed itself Malawi in 1964 , and the colony of Southern Rhodesia changed its name to simply `` Rhodesia &apos; &apos; . However , the change had not yet been officially ratified when Rhodesia declared itself independent , and as a result , the British Government continued to refer to the breakaway colony as `` Southern Rhodesia &apos; &apos; throughout its existence , a stance it maintained regarding the Juneâ `` December 1979 successor state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia .

The cipher is a 32-round substitution-permutation network operating on a block of four 32-bit words .
Like other AES submissions , Serpent has a block size of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128 , 192 or 256 bits .
The Serpent cipher has not been patented .
However , many cryptanalysts believe that once implementation considerations are taken into account the XSL attack would be more expensive than a brute force attack .
This maximizes parallelism , but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on DES .
Hence , Rijndael was selected as the winner in the AES competition .
Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel , using 32 1-bit slices .
Each round applies one of eight 4-bit to 4-bit S-boxes 32 times in parallel .
It is completely in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone .
The XSL attack , if effective , would weaken Serpent -LRB- though not as much as it would weaken Rijndael , which became AES -RRB- .
Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher which was a finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard -LRB- AES -RRB- contest , where it came second to Rijndael .
Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson , Eli Biham , and Lars Knudsen .
Serpent was widely viewed as taking a more conservative approach to security than the other AES finalists , opting for a larger security margin : the designers deemed 16 rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack , but specified 32 rounds as insurance against future discoveries in cryptanalysis .
The 32 rounds means that Serpent has a higher security margin than Rijndael ; however , Rijndael with 10 rounds is faster and easier to implement for small blocks .
Temperatures that people from a hotter climate consider normal can be termed a heat wave in a cooler area if they are outside the normal climate pattern for that area .
A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot weather , which may be accompanied by high humidity .
The term is applied both to routine weather variations and to extraordinary spells of heat which may occur only once a century .
There is no universal definition of a heat wave ; the term is relative to the usual weather in the area .

The area was part of the Cotswolds wool trade from the 13th century , generating much wealth , particularly in the western portions of the county in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds .
Future population growth in the county is hoped to be concentrated around Oxford , Banbury , Bicester , Didcot and Witney , near the South Midlands growth area .
It is divided into five local government districts : Oxford , Cherwell , Vale of White Horse -LRB- after the Uffington White Horse -RRB- , West Oxfordshire and South Oxfordshire .
Other significant settlements are Banbury , Bicester , Kidlington , and Chipping Norton to the north of Oxford ; Witney to the west ; Thame and Chinnor to the east ; and Abingdon , Wantage , Didcot , Wallingford and Henley-on-Thames to the south .
The Vale of the White Horse district and parts of the South Oxfordshire administrative district south of the River Thames were historically part of Berkshire , but were added to the administrative county of Oxfordshire in 1974 .

Austro-Bavarian or Bavarian -LRB- German : Bairisch , autonym Boarisch -RRB- is a major group of Upper German varieties spoken in the south east of the German language area .
In contrast to many other dialects of German , Austro-Bavarian differs sufficiently from Standard German to make it difficult for native Austro-Bavarian speakers to adopt standard pronunciation .
With the spread of universal education , the exposure of speakers of Austro-Bavarian to Standard German has been increasing , and many younger people , especially in the region &apos; s cities , and larger towns speak standard German with only a slight accent .
However , they gradually migrated down the Danube and into the Alps to all those areas where Austro-Bavarian dialects are spoken .
The Austro-Bavarian regiolect has its origins in the Germanic tribe known as the Bavarii , who established a tribal duchy , which covered much of what is today Bavaria and some of Austria in the early Middle Ages and was eventually subdued by Charlemagne .

Paul noted that Brachiosaurus brancai -LRB- on which most popular depictions of Brachiosaurus were based -RRB- showed significant differences from the North American Brachiosaurus , especially in the proportions of its trunk vertebrae and in its more gracile build . Paul used these differences to create a subgenus he named Brachiosaurus -LRB- Giraffatitan -RRB- brancai .
In 1991 , George Olshevsky asserted that these differences were enough to place the African brachiosaurid in its own genus , simply Giraffatitan .
Giraffatitan was one of the largest animals known to have walked the earth .
Jien records that he ruled from the palace of Ukena-no-miya at Katashiro in Kawachi in what will come to be known as Yamato province .
It is undisputed that this identification is Chinese in form and Buddhist in implication , which suggests that the name must have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Annei , possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the Kojiki .
Emperor Annei was either the eldest son or the only son of Emperor Suizei .
This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine -LRB- misasagi -RRB- at Nara .

Even at its peak in 1971 , its daily 650 passengers hardly made the line an economic proposition .
The 1950s saw attempts to improve the service on the branch , and eventually the line was given light electrification in 1957 .
The eastern section of the line , between Epping and Ongar , was always single track , with just one passing loop at North Weald station , and approximately 14 trains each day went as far as the rural station , with the rest terminating at Epping or Loughton .
Units 1616 and 1491 -LRB- formed as an eight-car train -RRB- were purchased in 1996 , and unit 1744 was purchased in 1998 .
The train that ran the final London Underground service on the line , a three-car unit of 1960 stock , has been preserved by Cravens Heritage Trains .
These trains served the North Weald airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening at the aerodrome almost adjacent to the station .
The line , under the running group -LRB- Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society -RRB- , reopened on Sunday 10 October 2004 , providing an hourly service between Ongar and North Weald .
The line employed a Harsco tug unit -LRB- `` Badger &apos; &apos; -RRB- for engineering work .
The line operated two diesel shunters , one a Drewry shunter -LRB- works number 2566 , current number D1995 -RRB- , named `` Heather &apos; &apos; by the railway , and two Ruston 88 shunters -LRB- RH 512572 is in service , RH 398616 is being used for spares and as a static display -RRB- .
The Ongar Railway Preservation Society entered a Â # 325,000 offer for the line , but Pilot Developments convinced London Underground to accept their slightly higher offer after the bidding deadline .
Blake Hall was permanently shut in 1981 ; it is said that the station , before closure , handled six customers a day .
Until this occurred , North Weald was the last section of the London Underground network to be signalled using mechanical semaphore signals .
The line was purchased by Pilot Developments -LRB- later Epping Ongar Railway Ltd . -RRB- in 1998 .
The line was shortly after extended to Coopersale , although no alighting facilities as yet exist here .
The line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of closure -LRB- operating a Sunday and Bank Holiday service using a Class 117 diesel multiple unit -RRB- , running between Ongar and Coopersale .
The steam shuttle was hired by the London Transport Executive from British Rail , as it was felt there was n &apos;t justification for electrification as far as Ongar unless patronage of the branch rose .
Independent politician Martin Bell described the deal as `` the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years &apos; &apos; , alleging a conflict of interest with local politicians .
The through train was operated as an extra train on the normal Central Line timetable but was only four cars long .
North Weald station &apos; s platform one was closed in 1976 , then the passing loop \ / westbound tracks were lifted in 1978 .
However , for two days every year , through trains were run from London , terminating at North Weald .
The service is provided by volunteers who maintain the line as well as run the trains .
The connection to Ongar was made in 1865 by the Eastern Counties \ / Great Eastern Railway .
The land and infrastructure is owned by a separate company , Epping Ongar Railway Ltd .
At the end of 2007 , as a result of the awarding of planning permission for the Ongar residential development -LRB- see below -RRB- , the railway was sold to a new private owner who is committed to bring steam back to the line .
At the time of its closure , it was carrying a mere 80 passengers a day ; local lore had it that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the nuclear bunker at Doddinghurst .
The railway at one point owned at least two trains of 1962 tube stock .
In early 2006 between 22 January and 9 April the line was shut down for engineering works .
The railway also owns four Finnish steam locomotives , and two wooden-bodied Finnish coaches .
This involved general station maintenance , rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance .
Servicability aside , these will not , and can not , be used for passenger services ; they are of a different -LRB- 5 ft -RRB- track gauge to the railway lines .
London Underground tried to close the entire line in 1980 ; instead , a reduced service was implemented , along with Blake Hall tube station being closed on Sundays .
The Epping Ongar Railway operates on a preserved railway along the final section of the old Great Eastern Railway and London Underground Central Line branch line between Epping and Ongar , with an intermediate station at North Weald .
Until this time , access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box still sited on the southbound platform to this day .
On September 30 , 1994 , the line , which was making a loss of seven pounds for each passenger journey and was in need of some expensive maintenance work , was finally closed to the public , the Central Line terminating at Epping Station .
These units were taken away to be cut up for scrap in 1998 and 2003 , respectively , after they were destroyed by vandals .
The Epping-Ongar branch lost its through trains to London , and a shuttle service between Epping -LRB- to connect with trains to London -RRB- and Ongar was implemented ; for a short time , one could see the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side-by-side at Epping .
Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on Sunday 28 May 2006 to passengers , although initially without the use of the station buildings .
The low-cost nature of the electrification meant that the branch could only support special two - or three-car trains -- the power supply was simply not strong enough to support full-size trains , and the short platforms on the branch line would not have been long enough to support eight-car trains .
The station building still survives , sans platform , as a private dwelling .
This remained the case until 1949 , when the London Transport Passenger Board &apos; s New Works scheme extended the Central Line to Epping using electric trains -LRB- taking over the railway from British Rail -RRB- .

Markets for trading commodities can be very efficient , particularly if the division into pools matches demand segments .
In the original and simplified sense , commodities were things of value , of uniform quality , that were produced in large quantities by many different producers ; the items from each different producer were considered equivalent .
This problem was extensively debated by Adam Smith , David Ricardo and Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow among others .
In classical political economy and especially Karl Marx &apos; s critique of political economy , a commodity is any good or service produced by human labor and offered as a product for general sale on the market .
Value and price are not equivalent terms in economics , and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and Marxist economists .
Marx &apos; s analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods , using the labor theory of value .
Some other priced goods are also treated as commodities , e.g. human labor-power , works of art and natural resources , even although they may not be produced specifically for the market , or be non-reproducible goods .
These markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find an equilibrium price and quantity .

According to the Constitution of Russia , oblasts are considered to be subjects of the Federation , which is a higher status than that of administrative units they had within the Russian SFSR before the dissolution of the Soviet Union .
During that period , the country was divided into 33 oblasts .
Since 1997 , Bulgaria has been divided into 28 oblasti , usually translated as provinces .
With a few exceptions , Soviet oblasts were named after their administrative centers .
Oblasts were administrative units of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes between 1922 and 1929 .
Oblasts are a type of administrative division of Belarus , Bulgaria , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia , Ukraine , and the now-defunct Soviet Union .
As any administrative units of this level , oblasts were composed of districts -LRB- raions -RRB- and cities \ / towns directly under oblasts &apos; jurisdiction .
The last translation may lead to confusion , because the subdivision of `` oblast &apos; &apos; is called `` raion &apos; &apos; which is translated as `` region &apos; &apos; or `` district &apos; &apos; , depending on the context .
The word `` oblast &apos; &apos; is a loanword in English , but it is nevertheless often translated as `` area &apos; &apos; , `` zone &apos; &apos; , `` province &apos; &apos; , or `` region &apos; &apos; .
The federal subject status gives the oblasts some degree of autonomy and gives them representation in the Federation Council .
Oblast is a type of administrative division in Slavic countries , including some countries of the former Soviet Union .
These oblasts were later merged into the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the Republika Srpska .
Before , the country was divided into nine bigger units , also called oblast .
The majority of then-existing oblasts were located on the periphery of the country -LRB- e.g. Kars Oblast or Transcaspian Oblast -RRB- or covered the areas where Cossacks lived .
The names of oblasts did not usually correspond to the names of the respective historical regions , as they were created as purely administrative units .
During the Yugoslav Wars , several Serbian Autonomous Oblasts were formed in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
In the Russian Empire , oblasts were considered to be administrative units and were included as parts of Governorates General or krais .
Official terms in successor states of the Soviet Union differ , but some still use a cognate of the Russian term , e.g. voblast -LRB- voblasts , voblasts &apos; , -RRB- is used for provinces of Belarus , and oblys -LRB- plural : oblystar -RRB- for provinces of Kazakhstan .
The consequences of these attacks include blindness and permanent scarring of the face and body .
Acid throwing -LRB- acid attack or vitriolage -RRB- is a form of violent assault .
In 2002 , Bangladesh introduced the death penalty for throwing acid and laws strictly controlling the sales of acids .

Apple licensed the iCal name from Brown Bear Software , who have used it for their iCal application since 1997 .
This issue is specific to Google Calendar users .
Updates to Snow Leopard 10.6.1 and 10.6.2 have not addressed these problems .
iCal &apos; s development has since been transferred to Apple US headquarters in Cupertino .
These problems include alarms not firing ; all alarms being set to one fixed date and time in the past , preventing them from firing ; alarms from repeat events being fired for all historic occurrences of that repeated event , resulting in dozens of alarms for one event .
iCal supports times zones , i.e. : if the function is enabled , and the computerâ s time zone changes , all the events in iCal are shifted to compensate for the time zone difference .
As of today , there is still no fix for this bug .
The release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard introduced several bugs into iCal with regard to alarms .
It has been reported that some users of iCal who have their calendar on a CalDAV server ca n &apos;t view or add events to their calendar .
Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X v10 .4 , Version 3 with Mac OS X v10 .5 and Version 4 as part of Mac OS X v10 .6 .
iCal was the first calendar application for Mac OS X to offer support for multiple calendars and the ability to publish \ / subscribe calendars to WebDAV server .
Originally released as a free download for Mac OS X v10 .2 on September 10 , 2002 , with the release of Mac OS X v10 .3 it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 1.5 .
The bug is that this problem also occurs when the time zone function is disabled , therefore whenever the computerâ s time zone changes , all the events in iCal shift as well .
iCal development is quite different from other Apple software because it was designed independently by a small French team working `` secretly &apos; &apos; in Paris , led by Jean-Marie Hullot , a friend of Steve Jobs .
iCal is a personal calendar application made by Apple Inc. that runs on the Mac OS X operating system .
This change in current with respect to position can be measured itself , or the height , z , of the tip corresponding to a constant current can be measured .
When a conducting tip is brought very near to the surface to be examined , a bias -LRB- voltage difference -RRB- applied between the two can allow electrons to tunnel through the vacuum between them .
Its development in 1981 earned its inventors , Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer -LRB- at IBM ZÃ 1 \ / 4 rich -RRB- , the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 .
A scanning tunneling microscope -LRB- STM -RRB- is an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level .
The STM is based on the concept of quantum tunneling .
These two modes are called constant height mode and constant current mode , respectively .
For an STM , good resolution is considered to be 0.1 nm lateral resolution and 0.01 nm depth resolution .
The benefit to using a constant height mode is that it is faster , as the piezoelectric movements require more time to register the change in constant current mode than the voltage response in constant height mode .
STM can be a challenging technique , as it requires extremely clean and stable surfaces , sharp tips , excellent vibration control , and sophisticated electronics .
On a second vote Mr Tony Brown -LRB- Speaker of the House of Keys -RRB- was nominated unopposed .
The Chief Minister is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor on the nomination of Tynwald after a general election of the House of Keys .
The Chief Minister -LRB- Manx : Ard-choylargh -RRB- is the executive head of the Isle of Man Government .
Before 1980 the Executive Council was chaired by the Lieutenant Governor , but thereafter the chairman was elected by Tynwald , the parliament of the Isle of Man .
The office derives from that of Chairman of the Executive Council .
After the general election in November 2006 , Mr John Shimmin MHK , Mr Stephen Rodan MHK -LRB- Minister for Health and Social Security -RRB- and Mr David Cannan MHK -LRB- former Minister for the Treasury -RRB- sought nomination as Chief Minister , but none received the necessary majority of votes in Tynwald .
He holds office until the next general election -LRB- i.e. , for 5 years -RRB- , and is eligible for re-appointment , but may be removed from office by Tynwald on a vote of no confidence in the Council of Ministers .
The title was changed to `` Chief Minister &apos; &apos; in 1986 .

BÃ gadan is a commune in the Gironde department in south-western France .
In the 1970s , integrated circuit technology and the subsequent creation of microprocessors , such as the Intel 4004 , further decreased size and cost and further increased speed and reliability of computers .
Several developers of ENIAC , recognizing its flaws , came up with a far more flexible and elegant design , which came to be known as the `` stored program architecture &apos; &apos; or von Neumann architecture .
While the technologies used in computers have changed dramatically since the first electronic , general-purpose computers of the 1940s , most still use the von Neumann architecture .
With the evolution of the Internet , personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household .
A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture commenced around this time , the first of these being completed in Great Britain .
The first working prototype to be demonstrated was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine -LRB- SSEM or `` Baby &apos; &apos; -RRB- in 1948 . The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator -LRB- EDSAC -RRB- , completed a year after the SSEM at Cambridge University , was the first practical , non-experimental implementation of the stored program design and was put to use immediately for research work at the university .
Shortly thereafter , the machine originally described by von Neumann &apos; s paperâ &apos; &apos; EDVACâ &apos; &apos; was completed but did not see full-time use for an additional two years .
Nearly all modern computers implement some form of the stored-program architecture , making it the single trait by which the word `` computer &apos; &apos; is now defined .
The 1980s witnessed home computers and the now ubiquitous personal computer .
The length of day and night could be re-programmed to compensate for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year .
The `` castle clock &apos; &apos; , an astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206 , is considered to be the earliest programmable analog computer .
This design was first formally described by John von Neumann in the paper First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC , distributed in 1945 .
In 1801 , Joseph Marie Jacquard made an improvement to the textile loom by introducing a series of punched paper cards as a template which allowed his loom to weave intricate patterns automatically .

Historically , computers evolved from mechanical computers and eventually from vacuum tubes to transistors .
There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology , such as optical computing , DNA computers , neural computers , and quantum computers .
Avant-garde refers to experimental work in art , music , culture , or politics .

Typically one part has a spike at its end , and the other part a pencil , or sometimes a pen .
Circles can be made by fastening one leg of the compasses into the paper with the spike , putting the pencil on the paper , and moving the pencil around while keeping the hinge on the same angle .
A compass is a technical drawing instrument that can be used for inscribing circles or arcs .
The most rigorous definition of this abstract tool is the `` collapsing compass &apos; &apos; ; having drawn a circle from a given point with a given radius , it disappears ; it can not simply be moved to another point and used to draw another circle of equal radius -LRB- unlike a real pair of compasses -RRB- .
Compass and straightedge construction is used to illustrate principles of plane geometry .
The hinge is set in such a way that the distance between the spikes on the map represents a certain distance in reality , and by measuring how many times the compasses fit between two points on the map the distance between those points can be calculated .
The radius of the circle can be adjusted by changing the angle of the hinge .
Although a real pair of compasses is used to draft visible illustrations , the ideal compass used in proofs is an abstract creator of perfect circles .
Compasses are usually made of metal , and consist of two parts connected by a hinge which can be adjusted .
As dividers , they can also be used as a tool to measure distances , in particular on maps .
Distances can be measured on a map using compasses with two spikes , also called a dividing compass .
Compasses can be used for mathematics , drafting , navigation , and other purposes .

Cadmium performs the same function as zinc in other anhydrases , but the diatoms live in environments with very low zinc concentrations and thus they utilize cadmium to perform functions normally carried out by zinc .
Cadmium is a common impurity in zinc ores , and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc . Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4 % of cadmium .
Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide -LRB- CdO -RRB- .
The most common oxidation state of cadmium is + 2 , though rare examples of + 1 can be found .
Hydrochloric acid , sulfuric acid and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride -LRB- CdCl2 -RRB- cadmium sulfate -LRB- CdSO4 -RRB- or cadmium nitrate -LRB- Cd -LRB- NO3 -RRB- 2 -RRB- .
In 2009 , 86 % of cadmium was used in batteries , predominantly in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries .
Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted , or cadmium sulfate is precipitated out of the electrolysis solution .
Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population . It has been estimated that about 10 % of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking .
Cadmium compounds were used to stabilize plastic . With the exception of its use in nickel-cadmium batteries and cadmium telluride solar panels , the use of cadmium is generally decreasing in its other applications .

Passer rating -LRB- known as passing efficiency or pass efficiency in NCAA football -RRB- is a measure of the performance of quarterbacks or any other passers in American football and Canadian football .
Passer rating is calculated using each quarterback &apos; s completion percentage , passing yardage , touchdowns and interceptions .
Aaron Rodgers currently holds the NFL record for the highest career passer rating for any player with at least 1,500 attempts , with a mark of 98.4 . The highest passer rating for a complete season is 121.1 set by Peyton Manning in 2004 -LRB- Manning also has completed four games with a perfect passer rating , another NFL record -RRB- .
The outer layers of the Earth are divided into lithosphere and asthenosphere .
Continental lithosphere is typically ~ 200 km thick , though this also varies considerably between basins , mountain ranges , and stable cratonic interiors of continents .
For a typical distance oceanic lithosphere must travel before being subducted , the thickness varies from about 6 km thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than 100 km at subduction zones ; for shorter or longer distances , the subduction zone -LRB- and therefore also the mean -RRB- thickness becomes smaller or larger , respectively .
Because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards , its thickness is therefore a function of its distance from the mid-ocean ridge where it was formed .
These plates move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries : convergent , or collisional boundaries ; divergent boundaries , also called spreading centers ; and conservative transform boundaries .
One of the most significant correlations found is that lithospheric plates attached to downgoing -LRB- subducting -RRB- plates move much faster than plates not attached to subducting plates .
Earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain-building , and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries .
In the case of the Earth , there are currently seven to eight major -LRB- depending on how they are defined -RRB- and many minor plates .
The two types of crust also differ in thickness , with continental crust being considerably thicker than oceanic -LRB- 35 km vs. 6 km -RRB- .
The lateral relative movement of the plates varies , though it is typically 0 â `` 100 mm annually .
The lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere .
The lithosphere is broken up into what are called `` tectonic plates &apos; &apos; .

Although the Metropolitan Police moved away from Scotland Yard in 1890 , the name New Scotland Yard was adopted for the new headquarters .
In 1967 New Scotland Yard moved to the present building at 10 Broadway , still within Westminster , which was an existing office block acquired under a long-term lease ; the first New Scotland Yard is now called the Norman Shaw -LRB- North -RRB- building , part of which is used as the headquarters for the Metropolitan Police &apos; s Territorial Policing department .
This occurs when the Pluto-Charon orbital plane is edge-on as seen from Earth , which only happens at two intervals in Pluto &apos; s 248-year orbital period .
Subsequent observations of Pluto determined that the bulge was due to a smaller accompanying body .
Later , the development of adaptive optics made it possible to resolve Pluto and Charon into separate disks using ground-based telescopes .
Charon was discovered by astronomer James Christy on June 22 , 1978 , when he was examining highly magnified images of Pluto on photographic plates taken a couple of months earlier .
All doubts were erased when Pluto and Charon entered a five-year period of mutual eclipses and transits between 1985 and 1990 .
Christy noticed that a slight elongation appeared periodically .
The discovery was announced on July 7 , 1978 .
The periodicity of the bulge corresponded to Pluto &apos; s rotation period , which was previously known from Pluto &apos; s light curve .
Later , the bulge was confirmed on plates dating back to April 29 , 1965 .
It was fortuitous that one of these intervals happened to occur so soon after Charon &apos; s discovery .
Charon is the largest satellite of the dwarf planet Pluto .
Images showing Pluto and Charon resolved into separate disks were taken for the first time by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 1990s .

To avoid the variety in subjective -LRB- equivocal -RRB- interpretation of quantifying terms such as `` green &apos; &apos; , `` hot &apos; &apos; , `` large &apos; &apos; , `` considerable &apos; &apos; , and `` negligible &apos; &apos; , scientists strive , where possible , to eliminate human senses by the use of standardized measuring tools like meter sticks , stopwatches , thermometers , electromechanical measuring instruments , spectrometers , voltmeters , timers , oscilloscopes , and gravimeters . This eliminates much of the perceptive variability of individual observers .
To be properly considered objective , the results of measurement must be communicated from person to person , and then demonstrated for third parties , as an advance in understanding of the objective world .
The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units so that everybody else understands them the same way .
Where nominal data must be used , the ideal is to use `` hard &apos; &apos; , objective criteria for assigning the classifications -LRB- see Operational definition -RRB- , such that different classifiers would produce the same assignments .
Such demonstrable knowledge would ordinarily confer demonstrable powers of prediction or technological construction .

The terrain in much of the park is dominated by ridges and valleys running roughly north and south ; many of these ridges peak at an eastâ `` west crest near the park &apos; s northern border which turns more northerlyâ `` southerly towards the park entrance .
The fame of Mesa Verde soon began to spread thanks to the Wetherill ranchers and the archeological work of Gustaf NordenskiÃ ld .
Mesa Verde is best known for cliff dwellings , which are structures built within caves and under outcropping in cliffs â &apos; &apos; including Cliff Palace , which is thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America .
By the late 12th century they began to build the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is famous .
Although explorers from Spain went through the general region in the 18th century , actual sight of the cliffs dwellings by outsiders seems to have first occurred in the latter half of the 19th century .
The Spanish term Mesa Verde translates into English as `` green table . &apos; &apos;
Approximately 600 of the over 4700 archeological sites found in Mesa Verde National Park are cliff dwellings .

: A lively introduction to probability theory for the beginner .
The mathematical theory of probability has its roots in attempts to analyze games of chance by Gerolamo Cardano in the sixteenth century , and by Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century -LRB- for example the `` problem of points &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
If an individual coin toss or the roll of a die is considered to be a random event , then if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain patterns , which can be studied and predicted .
The central objects of probability theory are random variables , stochastic processes , and events : mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion .
: The first major treatise blending calculus with probability theory , originally in French : ThÃ orie Analytique des ProbabilitÃ s .
Two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem .
As a mathematical foundation for statistics , probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data .
Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with analysis of random phenomena .
: The modern measure-theoretic foundation of probability theory ; the original German version -LRB- Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitrechnung -RRB- appeared in 1933 .
Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state , as in statistical mechanics .

The English Language Liturgical Consultation -LRB- ELLC -RRB- is an international ecumenical group whose primary purpose is to provide ecumenically accepted texts for those who use English in their liturgy .
The text is as follows :
The United Methodists commonly incorporate the Apostles &apos; Creed into their worship services .
I believe in the Holy Ghost ; The holy Catholick Church ; The Communion of Saints ; The Forgiveness of sins ; The Resurrection of the body , And the Life everlasting .
This form of the Apostles &apos; Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in The United Methodist Book of Worship , and hence it is growing in popularity and use .
I believe in the Holy Spirit , : the holy catholic Church , : the communion of saints , : the forgiveness of sins , : the resurrection of the body , : and the life everlasting .
In 1988 it produced a translation of the Apostles &apos; Creed , distinguished among other things by its avoidance of the word `` his &apos; &apos; in relation to God .
The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version -LRB- see below -RRB- , which includes `` he descended to the dead . &apos; &apos;
It is also used by Presbyterians , Methodists , and Congregationalists .
Credo in Spiritum Sanctum , sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam , sanctorum communionem , remissionem peccatorum , carnis resurrectionem , vitam aeternam .
This phrase and that on the communion of saints are articles found in the Apostles &apos; Creed , but not in the Old Roman Symbol nor in the Nicene Creed .
Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem , Creatorem caeli et terrae , et in Iesum Christum , Filium Eius unicum , Dominum nostrum , qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto , natus ex Maria Virgine , passus sub Pontio Pilato , crucifixus , mortuus , et sepultus , descendit ad Ã nferos , tertia die resurrexit a mortuis , ascendit ad caelos , sedet ad dexteram Patris omnipotentis , inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos .
: On the third day he rose again ; : he ascended into heaven , : he is seated at the right hand of the Father , : and he will come to judge the living and the dead .
It is widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes , most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition , including the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church , Lutheranism , the Anglican Communion , and Western Orthodoxy .
In the Church of England there are currently two authorized forms of the creed : that of the Book of Common Prayer -LRB- 1662 -RRB- and that of Common Worship -LRB- 2000 -RRB- .
Do you believe in Jesus Christ , His only son , our Lord , who was conceived by the Holy Spirit , and born of the virgin Mary , suffered under Pontius Pilate , was crucified , died and was buried . He descended into hell .
It is notable for omitting the line `` he descended into hell &apos; &apos; , but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version .
I believe in Jesus Christ , God &apos; s only Son , our Lord , : who was conceived by the Holy Spirit , : born of the Virgin Mary , : suffered under Pontius Pilate , : was crucified , died , and was buried ; : he descended into hell .
I believe in God , the Father almighty , : creator of heaven and earth .
The Apostles &apos; Creed -LRB- Latin : Symbolum Apostolorum or Symbolum Apostolicum -RRB- , sometimes titled Symbol of the Apostles , is an early statement of Christian belief , a creed or `` symbol &apos; &apos; .
On the third day he rose again ; he ascended into heaven , he is seated at the right hand of the Father , and he will come to judge the living and the dead .
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit , born of the Virgin Mary , suffered under Pontius Pilate , was crucified , dead , and buried ; the third day he rose from the dead ; he ascended into heaven , and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty ; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead .
This makes it acceptable to many Arians and Unitarians .
The United Methodist Hymnal also contains -LRB- at # 882 -RRB- what it terms the `` Ecumenical Version &apos; &apos; of this creedâ &apos; &apos; a version which is identical to that found in the Episcopal Church &apos; s current Book of Common Prayer .

Because of the haphazard interest in subjects , some famous book , such as Gone with the Wind , might go 7 years with only a hollow article about the book , while a particular comic book might be described in numerous articles , detailing each volume \ / issue published in the set of comics .
A full article , possibly expanded by a nurse or medical student , was hacked to become a partial stub , removing all the related information typically found in a medical encyclopedia : a real hatchet job , but not caught until weeks \ / months later .
Overall , Wikipedia users are divided into 2 groups of editors : the registered users , and the unregistered IP addresses .
Because there are tens of millions of notable subjects in the world , each person can write new articles each week , without always needing to expand some other , older article .
The fundamental problem with justifying deletion , such as by claiming , is that very few Wikipedia policies actually condone such deletions .
Small groups of editors often band together in Wikiprojects , to edit articles that share a common theme or topic .
What seemed to be a reasonable format limitation , years ago , might no longer apply .
Each Wikiproject develops its own rules , and many such groups have struggled to keep going , due to the limited time that the various volunteers can spend in editing so many articles .
For those reasons , some Wikipedia articles may seem quite bizarre , and several so-called `` official &apos; &apos; guidelines are still demanding peculiar rules , years later , with some rules so wiki-spastic they have never been considered in any other multi-user site .
The remaining bulk of Wikipedia contains random articles , added as each subject arises .
Hence , articles should be fixed only as time permits , not in a frantic rush to reach encyclopedic `` perfection &apos; &apos; .
Only a fraction of the total articles have been significantly expanded by multiple people .
Such long-term , multi-hacking of articles is known as `` wiki-rot &apos; &apos; .
Several portions of Wikipedia were created as articles copied from traditional encyclopedias , such as from the 1911 Britannica , or generated from a long list of town population-data , but those articles now represent , at most , maybe 10 % of the current article base .
However , in general , it is a good idea to re-visit older articles , every few months , to check for quality problems that have been added .
But some statistics have estimated the active editors , during a month , to be less than 300,000 people actively editing articles .
However , many of the registered users sometimes edit articles without logging in with their username , instead , just using their IP address .
When detecting excessive text removals , feel free to revert any self-righteous deletions , and try to restore text as intended by the writers , but always mindful of discussions on the talk-page .
The problem is so severe that there is even a policy , &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; -LRB- WP : IAR -RRB- , because many rules might no longer reflect what normal people would willingly follow .
For the majority of articles , Wikipedia has become a vast `` pot-luck dinner &apos; &apos; .
One of the most difficult aspects , for many people to realize , is that Wikipedia is basically `` invented out of thin air &apos; &apos; and people have retro-forced some rules with little regard to actually working with other people .
Even the most crucial problems , such as avoiding potentially private , or libelous , text about a living person , should be handled by mending or modifying , not deleting , the inserted text , per policy since 2007 , as noted in essay .
After several months , many articles tend to be hacked or adjusted , multiple times , in ways contrary to the original writing style , or in ways that introduce many errors .
The number of registered users , with login names , is -LRB- roughly million people -RRB- , with a similar number of unregistered users .
: : : : : -LRB- This is a draft to be expanded , later ... -RRB-
The articles are , mostly , a somewhat random collection of information that many people thought to be worthy of interest .
As with a pot-luck dinner , each individual brings something to the table , so most articles tend to be a one-person contribution .
Many articles about sports teams have been expanded into entire article-sets , with separate articles for each member of the team or coaching staff , or for each play-off season .
Many articles are written by each person acting alone , with each article later modified slightly by perhaps 10 other people , but essentially the viewpoint of one person .
It is not critical to make instant improvements , because many readers have come to expect rampant vandalism in numerous articles .
Expect such rampant deletions and be prepared to reverse them .
Typically , deletion of whole sections , of an article , is considered to be `` blanking &apos; &apos; -LRB- as a form of vandalism -RRB- .
The book \ / movie The Da Vinci Code was expanded into more than 12 articles about that single subject .
In prior years , many people set their personal Wikipedia-watchlists to receive update-alerts when articles had been hacked or changed , so the updates could be fixed or adjusted soon after .
However , such blanking is done , often , and sometimes justified as removing `` POV &apos; &apos; -LRB- slanted point-of-view -RRB- text from the article , while effectively axing entire sections .
After an article has stayed a while -LRB- after several months -RRB- , it might be radically expanded by another person , adding perhaps 30 % -50 % more information .
This essay , WP : Authors of Wikipedia -LRB- or `` Who writes this stuff &apos; &apos; -RRB- describes how articles are developed .

Gari , sweet , pickled ginger is eaten with sushi to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion .
Vitamins and minerals are found in much of the seafood and vegetables used for sushi .
In Japan , and increasingly abroad , sushi is served kaiten zushi -LRB- sushi train -RRB- style . Color coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt ; as the belt passes customers choose as they please .
The common ingredient across all the different kinds of sushi is sushi rice .
Thus , tuna can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in quantity .
As with most foods , sushi is not free from health risks , but these risks are minimized with proper preparation and service .
If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside-down then one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using gari -LRB- sliced ginger -RRB- as a brush . Toppings which have their own sauce -LRB- such as eel -RRB- should not be eaten with soy sauce .
Some large fish , such as tuna -LRB- especially bluefin -RRB- , can harbor high levels of mercury .

The original Delmonico &apos; s began in a rented pastry shop at 23 William Street in 1827 , appearing listed as a restaurant in 1830 .
It is also claimed to be the first to employ a separate wine list . .
Its grand location at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street closed in 1923 as a result of changing dining habits due to Prohibition .
The Tucci incarnation adopted the original menus and recipes , and became distinguished in its own right , continuing to attract prominent politicians and celebrities .
Other Delmonicos have operated in the space from 1981 â `` 1992 and from 1998 to present .
Relocating several times before settling at 2 South William Street for eighty years , it is credited with being the first restaurant in America to allow patrons to order from a menu Ã la carte , as opposed to table dâ hÃ te .

Almost immediately after the closing of the last Delmonico &apos; s , a number of imitators opened `` Delmonico &apos; s &apos; &apos; restaurants .
Beginning in the 1850s , the restaurant hosted the annual gathering of the New England Society of New York which featured many important speakers of the day .
The original and most famous was operated by the Delmonico family during the 19th and early 20th centuries , closing due to a Prohibition-era slowdown in 1923 .
The Delmonico family attempted to retain exclusive rights to the name , but a court ruled that with the closing of the last restaurant the name had passed into the public domain .
In 1981 , a new Delmonico &apos; s was opened at the location by Ed Huber , which operated until 1992 .

The resulting high CPU overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for TCQ .
This is preferable since the drive has the most knowledge of its performance characteristics , and is able to take rotational position into account .
The appropriate driver must be loaded into the operating system to enable NCQ on the host bus adapter .
For NCQ to be enabled , it must be supported and enabled in the SATA host bus adapter and in the hard drive itself .
In fact , newer mainstream Linux kernels support AHCI natively .
ATA &apos; s attempt at integrating TCQ was constrained by the requirement that ATA host bus adapters use ISA bus device protocols to interact with the operating system .
Windows XP requires the installation of a vendor-specific driver even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter .
This can reduce the amount of unnecessary drive head movement , resulting in increased performance -LRB- and slightly decreased wear of the drive -RRB- for workloads where multiple simultaneous read \ / write requests are outstanding , most often occurring in server-type applications .
NCQ and PATA TCQ have a maximum queue length of 32 outstanding commands -LRB- 31 in practice -RRB- .
Native Command Queuing -LRB- NCQ -RRB- is a technology designed to increase performance of SATA hard disks under certain conditions by allowing the individual hard disk to internally optimize the order in which received read and write commands are executed .
Many newer chipsets support the Advanced Host Controller Interface -LRB- AHCI -RRB- , which should allow a generic driver supplied by the operating system to control them and enable NCQ .
Native Command Queuing was preceded by Parallel ATA &apos; s version of Tagged Command Queuing -LRB- TCQ -RRB- .
Mammals include the endangered rodent Bramble Cay Melomys found only on Bramble Cay in the Torres Strait .
The remainder is mostly declared as National Park and managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service .
Cape York Peninsula is a large remote peninsula located in Far North Queensland at the tip of the state of Queensland , Australia , the largest unspoilt wilderness in eastern Australia and one of the last remaining wilderness areas on Earth .
This mountain range is made up of ancient -LRB- 1,500 million year-old -RRB- Precambrian and Palaeozoic rocks .
The largest contiguous rainforest area on the Cape occurs in the McIllwraith Range-Iron Range area .
There is also a new Interpretive Centre from which information on the rock art and local culture is available and tours can be arranged .
Tropical rainforests cover an area of 748,000 ha , or 5.6 percent of the total land area of Cape York Peninsula .
In this way , Australia and New Guinea remained connected until the shallow Torres Strait was last flooded around 8,000 years ago .
Rainforests depend on some level of rainfall throughout the long Dry season , climatic conditions that are mostly found on the eastern slopes of the Capeâ s coastal ranges .
There is no clear demarcation to the south , although the official boundary in the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act 2007 of Queensland runs along approximately 16 Â S latitude .
The floodplains of the Laura Basin , which are protected in the Lakefield and Jack River National Parks , are crossed by the Morehead , Hann , North Kennedy , Laura , Jack and Normanby Rivers .
Cape York Peninsula supports a complex mosaic of intact tropical rainforests , tropical and subtropical grasslands , savannahs , and shrublands tropical savannahs , heath lands , wetlands , wild rivers and mangrove swamps .
Between January and March , however , the median monthly rainfall ranges from about 170mm -LRB- 6.5 inches -RRB- in the south to over 500mm -LRB- 20 inches -RRB- in the north and on the Iron Range .
Weipa is the center for mining .
During the Dry season , those rivers are reduced to a series of waterholes and sandy beds .
Yet , with the arrival of torrential rains in the Wet season , they swell to mighty waterways , spreading across extensive floodplains and coastal wetlands and giving life to a vast array of freshwater and wetland species .
The Peninsulaâ s coastal areas and river estuaries are lined with mangrove forests of kwila and other trees .
The Peninsula Ridge forms the drainage divide between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Coral Sea .
Australiaâ s largest mangrove forest can be found at Newcastle Bay .
in the Iron Range and north of Weipa to about 700 mm .
Torres Strait Islander communities on the mainland are at Bamaga and Seisia .
Major national parks include the Jardine River National Park in the far north , Mungkan Kandju National Park near Aurukun , and Lakefield National Park in the southeast of the bioregion .
To the East and West of the Peninsula Ridge lie the Carpentaria and Laura Basins , themselves made up of ancient Mesozoic sediments .
Tapping those heavy tropical rainfalls , the peninsulaâ s rivers are also of particular importance for replenishing central Australiaâ s Great Artesian Basin .
The Gondwanan flora of this area includes Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae conifers and Arthrochilus , Corybas , and Calochilus orchids .
The Cape is also home to the Eastern brown snake , one of the world &apos; s most venomous snakes .
Long undisturbed by tectonic activity , the peninsula is an extremely eroded , almost level low plain dominated by mighty meandering rivers and vast floodplains , with some very low hills rising to some 800m elevation in the McIlwraith Range on the eastern side around Coen .
Almost all this rain falls between November and April , and only on the eastern slopes of the Iron Range is the median rainfall between June and September above 5mm -LRB- 0.2 inches -RRB- .
As it collided with the Pacific Plate on its northward journey , the high mountain ranges of central New Guinea emerged around 5 million years ago .
Birds of the peninsula include Buff-breasted Buttonquail -LRB- Turnix olivii -RRB- , Golden-shouldered Parrot -LRB- Psephotus chrysopterygius -RRB- , Lovely Fairywren -LRB- Malurus amabilis -RRB- , White-streaked Honeyeater -LRB- Trichodere cockerelli -RRB- , and Yellow-spotted Honeyeater -LRB- Meliphaga notata -RRB- while some such as Pied Oystercatcher are found in other parts of Australia but have important populations on the peninsula .
19 wetlands of national significance have been identified , mostly on the large floodplains and in coastal areas .
Annual rainfall is high , ranging from over 2000 mm .
Land uses include broad acre pastoralism , bauxite and silica sand mining , nature reserves , tourism and fishing .
Although the land is mostly flat and about half of the area is used for grazing cattle , and wildlife is threatened by introduced species and weeds , the relatively undisturbed eucalyptus wooded savannahs , tropical rainforests and other types of habitat are now recognized for their global environmental significance .
On their way , those wild , undisturbed rivers are lined with dense rainforests , sand dunes or mangroves .
Much has been damaged by overgrazing , mining , poorly controlled fires and feral pigs , cane toads , weeds , and other introduced species but Cape York Peninsula remains fairly unspoilt with intact and healthy river systems and no recorded plant or animal extinction since European settlement .
Cape York Peninsula contributes as much as a quarter of Australia &apos; s surface runoff .
These various habitats are home to about 3300 species of flowering plants and almost the entire area of Cape York Peninsula -LRB- 99.6 % -RRB- still retains its native vegetation and is little fragmented .
The road north of Lakeland Downs to the tip of the Peninsula is sometimes cut after heavy rains during the wet season -LRB- roughly December to May -RRB- .
Throughout the Pleistocene epoch Australia and New Guinea have been alternately land-linked and separated by water on a number of occasions .
This eclipse will occur on 13 November 2012 .
The largest islands in the strait include Prince of Wales Island , Horn Island , Moa , and Badu Island .
In the lee of this collision zone , the ancient rock formations of what is now Cape York Peninsula remained largely undisturbed .
The tropical landscapes are among the most stable in the world .
The first known contact between Europeans and Aborigines occurred on the west coast of the peninsula in 1606 but it was not settled by Europeans until the 19th century when fishing communities , then ranches and later mining towns were established .
The wetlands and coastal mangroves are noted for their importance as a fish nursery and crocodile habitat , providing important drought refuge and finally the Great Barrier Reef lies off the east coast and is an important marine habitat .
The mean annual temperatures range from 18 Â C at higher elevations to 27 Â C on the lowlands in the drier south-west .
During periods of glaciation and resulting low sea levels , Cape York Peninsula provided a low-lying land link .
`` The point of the Main , which forms one side of the Passage before mentioned , and which is the Northern Promontory of this Country , I have named York Cape , in honor of his late Royal Highness , the Duke of York . &apos; &apos;
Some of the world &apos; s most extensive and ancient Aboriginal rock painting galleries surround the town of Laura , some of which are available for public viewing .
In all this rainforest contains at least 1000 different plants , including 100 rare or threatened species , and 16 % of Australia &apos; s orchid species .
With little disturbance on both water flows and vegetation cover throughout entire catchments , Cape York Peninsula has been identified as one of the few places where tropical water cycles remain essentially intact .
Around 40 million years ago , the Indo-Australian tectonic plate began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana .
The temperature is warm to hot , with a cooler climate in higher areas .
at the southern border .
The flora of the peninsula includes original Gondwanan species , plants that have emerged since the breakup of Gondwana and species from Indo-Malaya and from across the Torres Strait in New Guinea with the most variety being found in the rainforest areas .
Aboriginal communities are at Hopevale , Pormpuraaw , Kowanyama , Aurukun , Lockhart River , Napranum , Mapoon , Injinoo , New Mapoon and Umagico .
European settlement led to the displacement of Aboriginal communities and the arrival of Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland .
At the tip of the peninsula lies Cape York , the northernmost point on the Australian continent .
Another link existed between Arnhem Land and New Guinea , at times enclosing an enormous freshwater lake -LRB- Lake Carpentaria -RRB- in the center of what is now the Gulf of Carpentaria .
As a result from its geological history , â the flora and fauna of Cape York Peninsula are a complex mixture of Gondwanan relics , Australian isolationists and Asian or New Guinean invadersâ -LRB- p . 41 -RRB- .
It was named by Lieutenant James Cook on 21 August 1770 in honor of Prince Edward , Duke of York and Albany , a brother of King George III of the United Kingdom , who had died three years earlier :
Cattle ranch leases occupy about 57 % of the total area , mostly located in central and eastern Cape York Peninsula .
The rainforests of the Iron Range support species that are also found in New Guinea , including the Eclectus Parrot and Southern Common Cuscus .
The remainder is extremey sparsely populated with about half the population living in very small settlements and cattle ranches .
The west coast borders the Gulf of Carpentaria and the east coast borders the Coral Sea . The peninsula is bordered on three sides -LRB- north , east and west -RRB- .
This article is about the peninsula located in the Australian state of Queensland ; it should not be confused with either Yorke Peninsula in South Australia , or Cape York , Greenland .
A completely sealed inland road links Cairns and the Atherton Tableland to Lakeland Downs and Cooktown .
To the west , a series of large , winding river systems including the Mitchell , Coleman , Holroyd , Archer , Watson , Wenlock , Ducie and Jardine catchments empty their waters into the Gulf of Carpentaria .
Today the peninsula has a population of only about 18,000 , of which a large percentage -LRB- ~ 60 % -RRB- are Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders .
Important wetlands include the Jardine Complex , Lakefield systems and the estuaries of the great rivers of the western plains .
Being almost exclusively untouched , old-growth forests and supporting a disproportionately high biodiversity including flora of Gondwanan and New Guinean origin , the rainforests are of high conservation significance .
The climate on Cape York Peninsula is tropical and monsoonal , with a heavy monsoon season from November to April , during which time the forest becomes almost inhabitable , and a dry season from May to October .
The backbone of Cape York Peninsula is the Peninsula Ridge , part of Australiaâ s Great Dividing Range .
The Peninsulaâ s river catchments are noted for their exceptional hydrological integrity .
The Peninsula is a popular tourist destination in the Dry Season for camping , hiking , birdwatching and fishing enthusiasts .
Many people make the adventurous , but rewarding , drive to the tip of Cape York , the northernmost point of mainland Australia .
On the Eastern slopes , the shorter , faster-flowing Jacky Jacky Creek , Olive , Pascoe , Lockhart , Stewart , Jeannie and Endeavour Rivers flow towards the Coral Sea , providing important freshwater and nutrients to the healthiest section of the Great Barrier Reef .
At the tip of Cape York , there is a sizeable service center on nearby Thursday Island .
The extensive wetlands on Cape York Peninsula are â among the largest , richest and most diverse in Australiaâ .
Although abundant and fully functioning on the peninsula , tropical savannahs are now rare and highly degraded in other parts of the world .
The Cape harbors an extraordinary biodiversity , with more than 700 vertebrate land animal species of which 40 are endemic .
As weather permits , the next total eclipse of the sun should be visible from Cape York , Australia , as well as some northern islands of New Zealand .
Indigenous land comprises about 20 % , with the entire West coast being held under Native title .
Along the Peninsula Developmental Road , there are small service centres at Lakeland , Laura and Coen .
Many of these wetland come into existence only during the Wet season and support rare or uncommon plant communities .
It is some 660 km from the southern border of Cook Shire , to the tip of Cape York .
At the peninsulaâ s widest point , it is 430 km from the Bloomfield River , in the southeast , across to the west coast -LRB- just south of the Aboriginal community of Kowanyama -RRB- .
The `` Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy &apos; &apos; study was commissioned by the Australian government in 1990 to create plans to protect the wilderness and a nomination for World Natural Heritage is currently being considered by the Queensland and Australian Federal governments .
There are several outstanding landforms on the peninsula : the large expanses of undisturbed dunefields at the eastern coast around Shelburne Bay and Cape Bedford-Cape Flattery ; the huge piles of black granite boulders at Black Mountain National Park and Cape Melville ; and the limestone karsts around Palmerston in the Capeâ s far south .
The riverbanks of the lowlands are home to specific wildlife of their own while the rivers including the Jardine , Jackson , Olive , Holroyd and the Wenlock are rich in fish .
Temperatures over 40 Â C and below 5 Â C are rare .
Other rainforest fauna includes 200 species of butterfly including 11 endemic butterflies one of which is the huge Green Birdwing , the Green Tree Python and the Northern Quoll a forest marsupial that is now severely depleted from eating the introduced poisonous cane toads .
The Queensland Government is currently poised to protect 13 of Cape York Peninsulaâ s wild rivers under the Wild Rivers Act 2005 .
Cape York Peninsula also contains one of the highest rates of endemism in Australia , with more than 260 endemic plant species found so far .
North-east Cape York Peninsula supports Australiaâ s largest areas of this highly diverse ecosystem .
The administrative and commercial center for much of Cape York Peninsula is Cooktown , located in its far south-eastern corner while the peninsulaâ s largest settlement is the mining town Weipa on the Gulf of Carpentaria .
Therefore , parts of the Peninsula have been noted for their exceptionally high wilderness quality .
There are extensive deposits of bauxite along the west or Gulf of Carpentaria coast .
Indeed , with only about 2.7 percent of Australia &apos; s land area it produces more run-off than all of Australia south of the Tropic of Capricorn .
On poor , dry soils tropical heathlands can be found .
Most of the Cape York Peninsula is drier than nearby New Guinea which limits the rainforest plants of that island from migrating across to Australia .
Pisanosaurus -LRB- meaning `` Pisano lizard &apos; &apos; -RRB- is a genus of primitive ornithischian dinosaur from the Late Triassic of what is now South America .

Santa Fe de Antioquia is a municipality in the Antioquia Department , Colombia .
Tourism has been , and continues to be one of the more important economic enterprises for the municipality .
The opening of the Tunnel of the West -LRB- which reduces the time and the distance between the locality and MedellÃ n -RRB- in 2006 has allowed hundreds of tourists to arrive each weekend , stimulating the vocation of the vicinity as a summer vacation site .
Founded in 1541 by Jorge Robledo as Villa de SantafÃ on the western bank of the Cauca River , in 1545 it received the coat of arms and the title of City of Antioquia from King Philip II of Spain .
The city is located approximately 50 miles north of MedellÃ n , the department capital .
It has a population of approximately 23,000 inhabitants .
All of the town is a historical site ; the architecture that has survived through the years gives Santa Fe de Antioquia the aspect of a city `` suspended &apos; &apos; in the colonial era , which is the reason the city was declared National monument .
The municipal area is 493 kmÂ , with a mountainous territory within the Central Cordillera of the Andes and watered by the rivers Cauca and Tonusco .
Due to the state of conservation of its colonial architecture , it was declared a national monument in 1960 .
The economy of Santa Fe de Antioquia is based on agriculture : the main products are coffee , maize and beans .
Its cathedral was constructed in 1799 and elevated to Diocese of Antioquia in 1804 by Pope Pius VII .
In 1813 Antioquia was declared a sovereign and independent state with Santa Fe as its capital , a status it maintained until 1826 , when MedellÃ n was chosen as the new departmental seat .
It was a mining town from its beginnings and the gold mining operation has been the base of its economy .
It was elevated to the status of parish in 1547 by the bishop of PopayÃ n . It changed its name in 1584 when it became the capital of Antioquia .

Van Gogh did not begin painting until his late twenties , and most of his best-known works were produced during his final two years .
Van Gogh spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers and traveled between The Hague , London and Paris , after which he taught in England .
An early vocational aspiration was to become a pastor and preach the gospel , and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium .
During this time he began to sketch people from the local community , and in 1885 painted his first major work The Potato Eaters .
He produced more than 2,000 artworks , consisting of around 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings and sketches .
Today many of his piecesâ &apos; &apos; including his numerous self portraits , landscapes , portraits and sunflowersâ &apos; &apos; are among the world &apos; s most recognizable and expensive works of art .
Vincent Willem van Gogh -LRB- , ; ; 30 March 1853 - 29 July 1890 -RRB- was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work had a far-reaching influence on 20th century art for its vivid colors and emotional impact .
Today , he is widely regarded as one of history &apos; s greatest painters and an important contributor to the foundations of modern art .

The 1983 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season in 53 years , with only four tropical storms forming .
The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season .
ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs .
ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 35 knots -LRB- 39 mph , 63 km \ / h -RRB- or tropical storm strength .
The 1983 season had a cumulative ACE of 16.86 -LRB- 17 -RRB- , which is well below normal and currently the least active season on record since the 1914 season , which had an ACE rating of 2.53 .

The word pogrom came from the verb Ð Ñ Ð 3 \ / 4 Ð 1 \ / 4 Ð Ñ Ñ , `` to destroy , to wreak havoc , to demolish violently &apos; &apos; -LRB- in perfective , taking the form Ð Ð 3 \ / 4 Ð Ñ Ð 3 \ / 4 Ð 1 \ / 4 Ð Ñ Ñ -RRB- .
A temporal dimension is a dimension of time . Time is often referred to as the `` fourth dimension &apos; &apos; for this reason , but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension .
The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for the space , i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector . This notion of dimension -LRB- the cardinality of a basis -RRB- is often referred to as the Hamel dimension or algebraic dimension to distinguish it from other notions of dimension .
Time is often referred to as the `` fourth dimension &apos; &apos; for this reason , but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension . A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change .
This may improve performance slightly in a system used by a single user , but may dramatically increase performance in a system with many users making widely varied requests on the disk surface .
A modern elevator processes the requests to stop at floors in the logical order 2 , 4 , and 5 , without unnecessary travel .
The queue is constantly receiving new requests and fulfilling and removing existing requests , and re-ordering the queue according to the current pending read \ / write requests and the changing position of the head .
In order to boost performance , it had to decide the order of the requests based on its own , possibly incorrect , idea of what the hard drive was doing .
With TCQ , the drive can make its own decisions about how to order the requests -LRB- and in turn relieve the operating system from having to do so -RRB- .
Tagged Command Queuing -LRB- TCQ -RRB- is a technology built into certain ATA and SCSI hard drives . It allows the operating system to send multiple read and write requests to a hard drive .
Before TCQ , an operating system was only able to send one request at a time .
If the buttons for floors 5 , 2 , and 4 are pressed in that order with the elevator starting on floor 1 , an old elevator would go to the floors in the order requested .
The exact reordering algorithm may depend upon the controller and the drive itself , but the host computer simply makes requests as needed , leaving the controller to handle the details .
ATA TCQ is not identical in function to the more efficient native command queuing -LRB- NCQ -RRB- used by SATA drives .
SCSI TCQ does not suffer from the same limitations as ATA TCQ .
The result is that TCQ can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly .
For efficiency the sectors should be serviced in order of proximity to the current head position , rather than in the order received .
This queuing mechanism is sometimes referred to as `` elevator seeking &apos; &apos; , as the image of a modern elevator in a building servicing multiple calls and processing them to minimize travel illustrates the idea well .
Non-queueing disk drives service the requests in the order received , like an old elevator ; queueing drives service requests in the most efficient order .

The Hutu are the largest of the three ethnic groups in Burundi and Rwanda ; according to the United States Central Intelligence Agency , 84 % of Rwandans and 85 % of Burundians are Hutu , although other sources have found statistics that differ by several percent .
The Hutu , or Abahutu , are a Central African ethnic group , living mainly in Rwanda and Burundi .
The division between the Hutu and the Tutsi -LRB- the larger of the other two groups -RRB- is based more upon social class than ethnicity , as there are no significant linguistic , physical , or cultural differences between them .
The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced .
Messenger RNA -LRB- mRNA -RRB- is the RNA that carries information from DNA to the ribosome , the sites of protein synthesis -LRB- translation -RRB- in the cell .
Ribosomal RNA -LRB- rRNA -RRB- is the catalytic component of the ribosomes .
The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of tRNA . In prokaryotic cells , which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments , mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA .
Second , while DNA contains deoxyribose , RNA contains ribose -LRB- in deoxyribose there is no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2 &apos; position -RRB- .
Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules : 18S , 5.8 S , 28S and 5S rRNA .
In the cytoplasm , ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome .
This process uses transfer RNA -LRB- tRNA -RRB- molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome , where ribosomal RNA -LRB- rRNA -RRB- links amino acids together to form proteins .
RNA is made within living cells by RNA polymerases , enzymes that act to copy a DNA or RNA template into a new RNA strand through processes known as transcription or RNA replication , respectively . RNA and DNA are both nucleic acids , but differ in three main ways .
The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis .
The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA -LRB- tRNA -RRB- and ribosomal RNA -LRB- rRNA -RRB- , both of which are involved in the process of translation .
Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time .
Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus , and one is synthesized elsewhere .
They are a group bird and have a large range of displays from screams and whistles to grunts and bill clapping .
The Wandering Albatross , Snowy Albatross , or White-winged Albatross , Diomedea exulans , is a large seabird from the family Diomedeidae which has a circumpolar range in the Southern Ocean .

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life , such as morality , she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal .
One biographer has called it `` perhaps the most original book of -LRB- Wollstonecraft &apos; s -RRB- century &apos; &apos; .
Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman hurriedly in order to respond directly to ongoing events ; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it .
A Vindication of the Rights of Woman : with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects -LRB- 1792 -RRB- , written by the 18th-century British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft , is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy .
The Rights of Woman was actually well-received when it was first published in 1792 .
Although it is commonly assumed now that the Rights of Woman was unfavourably received , this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of William Godwin &apos; s Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman -LRB- 1798 -RRB- .
Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage , Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men .

There are Baptist churches where the deacons decide many of the church affairs . There are churches where deacons serve in a family ministry only .
Depending on local tradition , deacons are addressed as either `` Father &apos; &apos; , `` Father Deacon , &apos; &apos; `` Deacon Father , &apos; &apos; or , , if addressed by a Bishop , simply as `` Deacon &apos; &apos; .
In the New Apostolic Church , the deacon ministry is a local ministry . A deacon mostly works in his home congregation to support the priests .
Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece ; however , in 486 BC , his Egyptian subjects revolted , indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition .
The Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11 .
Although historically inaccurate , the legend of a Greek messenger running to Athens with news of the victory became the inspiration for this athletic event , introduced at the 1896 Athens Olympics , and originally run between Marathon and Athens .
After Darius died , his son Xerxes I re-started the preparations for a second invasion of Greece , which finally began in 480 BC .
Stalemate ensued for five days , before the Athenians -LRB- for reasons that are not completely clear -RRB- decided to attack the Persians .
The Battle of Marathon is perhaps now more famous as the inspiration for the Marathon race .
In 490 BC , he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean , to subjugate the Cyclades , and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria .
The Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies on the flanks , before turning inwards to surround the Persian center , which had been more successful against the thin Greek center .
The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece , and the Persian force retreated to Asia .
The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships , and managed to capture seven ships , though the majority were able to successfully launch .
For instance , John Stuart Mill famously suggested that `` the Battle of Marathon , even as an event in British history , is more important than the Battle of Hastings &apos; &apos; .
Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade , Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece .
Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians , the hoplites proved devastatingly effective against the more lightly armed Persian infantry , routing the wings before turning in on the center of the Persian line .
In response to this raid , Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria .
The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis , but were then forced to retreat with heavy losses .
Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the Persian army , protected for the most part by their armor , the Greek line finally collided with the enemy army .
Some , unaware of the local terrain , ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned .
It was fought between the citizens of Athens , aided by Plataea , and a Persian force commanded by Datis and Artaphernes .
The battle ended when the Persian center then broke in panic towards their ships , pursued by the Greeks .
Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization , which has been enduringly influential in western society , the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in European history .
The Battle of Marathon -LRB- , MachÄ `` tou MarathÅ nos -RRB- took place in 490 BC , during the first Persian invasion of Greece .
Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean , the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria .
The Persian force then sailed for Attica , landing in the bay near the town of Marathon .
The first Persian invasion was a response to Greek involvement in the Ionian Revolt , when Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule .
The Athenians had honed their style of fighting in combat with other phalanxes , wooden shields smashing against wooden shields , iron spear tips clattering against breastplates of bronze ... in those first terrible seconds of collision , there was nothing but a pulverizing crash of metal into flesh and bone ; then the rolling of the Athenian tide over men wearing , at most , quilted jerkins for protection , and armed , perhaps , with nothing more than bows or slings .
Holland provides an evocative description : `` The enemy directly in their path ... realized to their horror that -LRB- the Athenians -RRB- , far from providing the easy pickings for their bowmen , as they had first imagined , were not going to be halted ... The impact was devastating .
The Athenians , joined by a small force from Plataea , marched to Marathon , and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon .
It was the culmination of the first attempt by Persia , under King Darius I , to subjugate Greece .
Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield , and it is unknown how many more perished in the swamps .
The hoplites &apos; ash spears , rather than shivering ... could instead stab and stab again , and those of the enemy who avoided their fearful jabbing might easily be crushed to death beneath the sheer weight of the advancing men of bronze . &apos; &apos;
The Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars , showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten ; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at Marathon .

59 people were killed in Sinaloa .
However , when a northward motion became apparent , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Manzanillo , Colima , to Cabo Corrientes and for the Islas Marias .
Damage was heaviest where the hurricane made landfall .
The hurricane maintained its strength as it continued northward , and made landfall on Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa on September 15 .
Convective banding became better organized , and late on September 12 it developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located about 350 m south-southwest of Manzanillo , Colima .
Navy rescue teams and other fishermen searched for days off the Mexican coast to find victims and survivors from the storm .
As a result 52 boats were wrecked , of which 20 sank .
Shortly thereafter , the warning was extended to Los Mochis and issued for the eastern coast of Baja California Sur south of 25 Â N. Ten hours before Ismael made its final landfall , the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning from MazatlÃ n to Los Mochis .
Initially the storm moved to the northwest , though in response to the interaction with an upper-level low over Baja California Ismael gradually turned to the north .
Moisture from the remnants of Ismael extended into southwestern Arizona and southern New Mexico .
Offshore , Ismael produced waves of up to 30 feet -LRB- 9 m -RRB- in height .
Hundreds of fishermen were unprepared for the hurricane , which was expected to move more slowly , and as a result 52 ships were wrecked , killing 57 fishermen .
In one municipality , the passage of the hurricane destroyed 373 cardboard houses and damaged 4,790 others .
Ismael attained hurricane status on September 14 while located 210 miles -LRB- 340 km -RRB- off the coast of Mexico .
The passage of the hurricane left 177 houses without drinking water and left four municipalities without power .
Ismael steadily strengthened as it moved northward , though it failed to organize significantly ; early on September 14 the center remained poorly defined despite winds of 70 m . However , the outflow remained well-organized as it remained over warm waters . Ismael became better organized , and later on September 14 it intensified into a hurricane while located 210 miles -LRB- 340 km -RRB- west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta .
While moving through northwestern Mexico , Hurricane Ismael dropped moderate to heavy rainfall including a state record of 7.76 i in Sinaloa , resulting in the flooding of four municipalities .
In Los Mochis , the winds from Ismael knocked down houses and telephone poles , though no deaths were reported .
Throughout Sonora , the strong winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs of 6,827 homes .
The hurricane also destroyed 107 schools and 2 health centers in the state .
Prior to the arrival of the hurricane , 1,572 people evacuated to five emergency shelters .
The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses , leaving 30,000 people homeless .
On land , Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland Mexico and resulted in $ 26 million in damage -LRB- 1995 USD , $ USD -RRB- .
In addition , about 83 sq . miles -LRB- 215 kmÂ -RRB- of crop lands were impacted .
The depression moved to the northwest , and following an increase in deep convection it intensified into Tropical Storm Ismael early on September 13 .
Severe flooding was reported in Huatabampo .
The hurricane also weakened 2,163 miles -LRB- 3,481 km -RRB- of gravel roads and damaged about 100 miles -LRB- 165 km -RRB- of paved highways .
In addition , there were unofficial estimates of over 10 i . The rainfall led to flooding of roads and buildings .
Hurricane Ismael produced 30 foot -LRB- 9 m -RRB- waves over the Gulf of California and coastal waters off of Mexico .
About 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands , sandbars , or disabled fishing boats .
Ismael rapidly weakened over land , and dissipated on September 16 over northwestern Mexico .
In Lubbock , Texas , the rainfall led to flash flooding , closing many intersections and roads .
Hurricane Ismael was a weak Pacific hurricane that killed over one hundred people in northern Mexico in September of the 1995 Pacific hurricane season .

The keys , in practice , represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link .
Symmetric-key algorithms can be divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers .
Other terms for symmetric-key encryption are secret-key , single-key , shared-key , one-key , and private-key encryption .
Some examples of popular and well-respected symmetric algorithms include Twofish , Serpent , AES -LRB- Rijndael -RRB- , Blowfish , CAST5 , RC4 , 3DES , and IDEA .
Symmetric ciphers have historically been susceptible to known-plaintext attacks , chosen plaintext attacks , differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis .
The encryption key is trivially related to the decryption key , in that they may be identical or there is a simple transformation to go between the two keys .
Blocks of 64 bits have been commonly used . The Advanced Encryption Standard -LRB- AES -RRB- algorithm approved by NIST in December 2001 uses 128-bit blocks .
Stream ciphers encrypt the bits of the message one at a time , and block ciphers take a number of bits and encrypt them as a single unit .

The replication of functional units was only made possible when the die area of a single-issue processor no longer stretched the limits of what could be reliably manufactured .
Since microarchitecture design decisions directly affect what goes into a system , attention must be paid to such issues as :
This is achieved by replicating the state hardware -LRB- such as the register file and program counter -RRB- for each active thread .
On average , every fifth instruction executed is a branch , so without any intervention , that &apos; s a high amount of stalling .
The addition of caches reduces the frequency or duration of stalls due to waiting for data to be fetched from the memory hierarchy , but does not get rid of these stalls entirely .
A further enhancement is simultaneous multithreading .
The pipeline includes several different stages which are fundamental in microarchitecture designs .
As semiconductor manufacturing progressed , more and more of these techniques could be implemented on a single semiconductor chip .
This technique is used in most modern microprocessors , microcontrollers , and DSPs .
The difference is that a multithreaded CPU can do a thread switch in one CPU cycle instead of the hundreds or thousands of CPU cycles a context switch normally requires .
For large corporations , large scale -LRB- 16-256 -RRB- multiprocessors are common .
Even with all of the added complexity and gates needed to support the concepts outlined above , improvements in semiconductor manufacturing soon allowed even more logic gates to be used .
It was not long before improvements in chip manufacturing allowed for even more circuitry to be placed on the die , and designers started looking for ways to use it .
This trend is sometimes known as throughput computing .
Though this does not speed up a particular program \ / thread , it increases the overall system throughput by reducing the time the CPU is idle .
This idea originated in the mainframe market where online transaction processing emphasized not just the execution speed of one transaction , but the capacity to deal with massive numbers of transactions .
The size , latency , throughput and connectivity of memories within the system are also microarchitectural decisions .
Generally speaking , more cache means more performance , due to reduced stalling .
Early processor designs would carry out all of the steps above for one instruction before moving onto the next .
The pipelined datapath is the most commonly used datapath design in microarchitecture today .
Step -LRB- 2 -RRB- often introduces a lengthy -LRB- in CPU terms -RRB- delay while the data arrives over the computer bus .
Previously , it did n &apos;t make much sense to build a pipeline that could run faster than the access latency of off-chip memory .
The design of pipelines is one of the central microarchitectural tasks .
A considerable amount of research has been put into designs that avoid these delays as much as possible .
Some designs , such as Sun Microsystems &apos; UltraSPARC T1 have reverted back to simpler -LRB- scalar , in-order -RRB- designs in order to fit more processors on one piece of silicon .
The instruction issue logic grows in complexity by reading in a huge list of instructions from memory and handing them off to the different execution units that are idle at that point .
Speculative execution is a further enhancement in which the code along the predicted path is not just prefetched but also executed before it is known whether the branch should be taken or not .
The ISA is roughly the same as the programming model of a processor as seen by an assembly language programmer or compiler writer . The ISA includes the execution model , processor registers , address and data formats among other things .
Architectures that are dealing with data parallelism include SIMD and Vectors .
In early designs a cache miss would force the cache controller to stall the processor and wait .
One barrier to achieving higher performance through instruction-level parallelism stems from pipeline stalls and flushes due to branches .
Although any one instruction takes just as long to complete -LRB- there are still four steps -RRB- the CPU as a whole `` retires &apos; &apos; instructions much faster and can be run at a much higher clock speed .
System-level design decisions such as whether or not to include peripherals , such as memory controllers , can be considered part of the microarchitectural design process .
The CPU includes a cache controller which automates reading and writing from the cache , if the data is already in the cache it simply `` appears , &apos; &apos; whereas if it is not the processor is `` stalled &apos; &apos; while the cache controller reads it in .
In the outline above the processor processes parts of a single instruction at a time .
One technique of how this parallelism is achieved is through multiprocessing systems , computer systems with multiple CPUs .
For these reasons , newer generations of computers have started to exploit higher levels of parallelism that exist outside of a single program or program thread .
Over the years , a central goal was to execute more instructions in parallel , thus increasing the effective execution speed of a program .
This technique allows superscalar CPUs to execute instructions from different programs \ / threads simultaneously in the same cycle .
Cache is simply very fast memory , memory that can be accessed in a few cycles as opposed to `` many &apos; &apos; needed to talk to main memory .
These units perform the operations or calculations of the processor .
This would allow up to four instructions to be `` in flight &apos; &apos; at one time , making the processor look four times as fast .
One of the most common was to add an ever-increasing amount of cache memory on-die .
Of course there may be some other instruction in the program whose data is available in the cache at that point .
Register renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions .
Large portions of the circuitry were left idle at any one step ; for instance , the instruction decoding circuitry would be idle during execution and so on .
Initially these techniques could only be implemented on expensive mainframes or supercomputers due to the amount of circuitry needed for these techniques .
With further transistor size reductions made available with semiconductor technology advances , multicore CPUs have appeared where multiple CPUs are implemented on the same silicon chip .
Branch prediction is where the hardware makes educated guesses on whether a particular branch will be taken .
Even personal computers with multiple CPUs have appeared since the 1990s .
Once reserved for high-end mainframes and supercomputers , small scale -LRB- 2-8 -RRB- multiprocessors servers have become commonplace for the small business market .
Techniques such as branch prediction and speculative execution are used to lessen these branch penalties .
Unlike architectural design , where achieving a specific performance level is the main goal , microarchitectural design pays closer attention to other constraints .
The guess allows the hardware to prefetch instructions without waiting for the register read .
Execution units include arithmetic logic units -LRB- ALU -RRB- , floating point units -LRB- FPU -RRB- , load \ / store units , branch prediction , and SIMD .
Some of these stages include instruction fetch , instruction decode , execute , and write back .
Computer programs could be executed faster if multiple instructions were processed simultaneously .
The results are then collected and re-ordered at the end .
Out-of-order execution allows that ready instruction to be processed while an older instruction waits on the cache , then re-orders the results to make it appear that everything happened in the programmed order .
Conceptually , multithreading is equivalent to a context switch at the operating system level .
Caches and pipelines were a perfect match for each other .
Computer architecture is the combination of microarchitecture and instruction set design .
The choice of the number of execution units , their latency and throughput is a central microarchitectural design task .
Additionally , the large transistor counts and high operating frequencies needed for the more advanced ILP techniques required power dissipation levels that could no longer be cheaply cooled .
Using on-chip cache memory instead , meant that a pipeline could run at the speed of the cache access latency , a much smaller length of time .
Initially used in chips targeting embedded markets , where simpler and smaller CPUs would allow multiple instantiations to fit on one piece of silicon .
Computer architects have become stymied by the growing mismatch in CPU operating frequencies and DRAM access times . None of the techniques that exploited instruction-level parallelism within one program could make up for the long stalls that occurred when data had to be fetched from main memory .
This includes decisions on the performance-level and connectivity of these peripherals .
In the same basic example , the processor would start to decode -LRB- step 1 -RRB- a new instruction while the last one was waiting for results .
The pipelined architecture allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution , much like an assembly line .
Execution units are also essential to microarchitecture .
These efforts introduced complicated logic and circuit structures .
From the time that the processor &apos; s instruction decoder has figured out that it has encountered a conditional branch instruction to the time that the deciding register value can be read out , the pipeline needs to be stalled for several cycles , or if it &apos; s not and the branch is taken , the pipeline needs to be flushed .
By the late 1980s , superscalar designs started to enter the market place .
Pipelines improve performance by allowing a number of instructions to work their way through the processor at the same time .
Complicating this simple-looking series of steps is the fact that the memory hierarchy , which includes caching , main memory and non-volatile storage like hard disks , -LRB- where the program instructions and data reside -RRB- has always been slower than the processor itself .
Suppose we have two groups of instruction that will use the same register . One set of instructions is executed first to leave the register to the other set , but if the other set is assigned to a different similar register , both sets of instructions can be executed in parallel .
This is what superscalar processors achieve , by replicating functional units such as ALUs .
By 2005 , semiconductor technology allowed dual high-end desktop CPUs CMP chips to be manufactured in volume .
One of the first , and most powerful , techniques to improve performance is the use of the instruction pipeline .
With transaction-based applications such as network routing and web-site serving greatly increasing in the last decade , the computer industry has re-emphasized capacity and throughput issues .
RISC designs started adding cache in the mid-to-late 1980s , often only 4 KB in total .
In modern designs it is common to find two load units , one store -LRB- many instructions have no results to store -RRB- , two or more integer math units , two or more floating point units , and often a SIMD unit of some sort .
Some architectures include other stages such as memory access .
This number grew over time , and typical CPUs now have at least 512 KB , while more powerful CPUs come with 1 or 2 or even 4 , 6 , 8 or 12 MB , organized in multiple levels of a memory hierarchy .
Another technique that has become more popular recently is multithreading .
In multithreading , when the processor has to fetch data from slow system memory , instead of stalling for the data to arrive , the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute .
What follows is a survey of micro-architectural techniques that are common in modern CPUs .
This allowed the operating frequencies of processors to increase at a much faster rate than that of off-chip memory .

Viacom , which had previously paid Harmonix $ 150 million for their performance behind Rock Band in 2007 , are now seeking to get a `` substantial &apos; &apos; refund on that amount due to the weak sales in 2009 .
To address the changing market , rhythm game developers attempted to introduce new features into their games .
Vib-Ribbon was released by NanaOn-Sha -LRB- the creator of PaRappa the Rapper -RRB- in 1999 , and also eschewed instrument-shaped controllers .
Total sales of rhythm games , having reached $ 1.4 billion in 2008 , reached only $ 700 million in 2009 , with analysts predicting the market will settle at the same `` healthy &apos; &apos; $ 500 â `` 600 million level seen by the Call of Duty series .
Guitar Hero : Warriors of Rock and DJ Hero 2 sold only 86,000 and 59,000 copies in North America during their first week of sales , respectively , a sharp contrast to Guitar Hero III which had seen nearly 1.4 million units in its first week in 2008 .
The game was later released on consoles in the West -LRB- as Taiko Drum Master -RRB- and the franchise continues to receive new installments in Japan .
Despite these new modes , sales of music games faltered in 2010 .
Viacom is also seeking to further reduce costs by negotiating new deals with music publishers to reduce the costs associated with music licensing for the Rock Band series .

It has been called the first rhythm-action game in retrospect .
Analysts suggest that the market for these types of peripheral rhythm games may be stagnant for three to five years after which they may resurge on new consoles or based on different distribution models such as a stronger focus on downloadable content .
As a result , analysts have lowered expectations for future music games ; projections for sales of DJ Hero , a spinoff of Guitar Hero published by Activision , have been reduced from 1.6 million units in the first fiscal quarter of sales in the United Sates to only 600,000 .
Industry pundits believe that as sales of music games requiring peripheral controllers lag , dance-based games , along with surging popularity of pop music , will continue to thrive for some time .
However , these graphical responses are usually in the background , and the avatar is less important to the player than it is to spectators .
Activision scaled back its 2010 Guitar Hero release schedule to just two full games , reducing the number of SKUs from 25 in 2009 to 10 in 2010 .
The weakening market for rhythm video games has created fallout effects impacting both game developers and distributors .
In addition to rhythm , the occasional game may challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button .
Analysts for the video game market considered 2009 to be critical to further success of the genre .
In 1997 , Konami &apos; s Beatmania sparked an emergent market for rhythm games in Japan .
The success of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises widened the console video game market and its demographics , with the popularity of the music game driving increased sales of consoles .
By 2008 , rhythm games were considered to be one of the most popular video game genres , behind other action games .
The Guitar Hero franchise followed suit with Guitar Hero World Tour , developed by Neversoft rather than Harmonix .
The game was inspired by GuitarFreaks , but while the latter had used esoteric -LRB- to Westerners -RRB- Japanese pop music , Guitar Hero featured Western rock music .
Games such as Dance Central , Michael Jackson : The Game , and Child of Eden are all games based on the new motion sensing technology aimed to encourage more engaging dance routines .
Sales of music games were down in the first half of the year , though part was attributed to fewer purchases of the instrument controllers which players had already purchased and could reuse for other games .
With the introduction of motion control to both the Xbox 360 -LRB- through Kinect -RRB- and the PlayStation 3 -LRB- through PlayStation Move -RRB- in 2010 and 2011 , along with existing Wii motion control , some analysts believed the rhythm market would resurges through a new wave of dance-based video games and band-based ones that use platform-agnostic controllers to replicate real-life actions .
One of those successes , GuitarFreaks , featured a guitar-shaped controller .
The game was highly successful not only in Japan but globally , unlike games such as GuitarFreaks , DrumMania and Beatmania -LRB- though the latter had some success in Europe -RRB- .
These courses were generated in a way that depended on the background music and players could load their own music to play along .
The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices .
Though signs of the impact of the late-2000s recession on the video game markets were considered a factor in lower sales , it was also taken as a sign of the waning popularity of the titles , now considered to be saturating the market .
1998 &apos; s Pop ` n Music , a game similar to Beatmania , featuring multiple colorful buttons was also successful .
The game required players to press buttons corresponding to the order they appeared on-screen ; this basic mechanic would form the core of future rhythm games .
Rhythm game , or rhythm action , is a subgenre of action game that challenges a player &apos; s sense of rhythm , and includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and other music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero .
The game was inspired by similar , earlier Japanese games , but Harmonix added rock music aimed at a Western audience .
The company &apos; s music division , Bemani , released a number of music games over the next several years .
Players take turns repeating increasingly-complicated sequences of button presses and the game implemented the `` call and response &apos; &apos; mechanic used by later music video games .
Ultimately , during the third quarter of 2010 , Viacom began seeking a buyer for Harmonix , recognizing they did not have the efficiency and capacity to deal with cost of maintaining a video game developer compared with dedicated video game publishers .
Further contributing to the decline is the lack of innovation in the genre , as such games have not changed their basic play model over their last several iterations , leading to consumers less likely to buy additional titles .
The success of the game revived the genre and spawned two hugely successful franchises in Guitar Hero and the later Rock Band .
The game was a surprise hit , inspiring Konami &apos; s Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game , and to then begin experimenting with other rhythm games over the next few years .
The most successful of these was dance mat game Dance Dance Revolution , which was also the only one to achieve large-scale success outside of Japan .
Unlike most other games in the genre , the game also featured a completely original soundtrack and an acclaimed plot .
In 2001 , Taiko no Tatsujin combined traditional Japanese drums with contemporary pop music , and became highly successful in Japanese arcades .
The game allowed the player to control multiple instruments and gave a greater feeling of creative control .
By the end of 2010 , the rhythm market , initially propped by game bundles with instrument controllers , was considered `` well past its prime &apos; &apos; and has shifted towards downloadable content and potential integration with motion control systems .
While it was praised for its unique style and timeless artistry , its simple vector graphics proved difficult to market and the game was never afforded a release in North America .
Rhythm game , or rhythm action , is a genre of music-themed action video games .
Gitaroo Man featured a guitar-playing protagonist , 4 years before the release of Guitar Hero , though the game employed a conventional rather than guitar-shaped controller .
Both the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises expanded in this year with new games on other gaming platforms including handheld gaming devices and mobile phones and with titles targeted towards specific genres or demographics , such as Band Hero for pop music and Lego Rock Band for younger players .
The genre also includes games that measure both rhythm and pitch , in order to test a player &apos; s singing ability .
Dance Dance Revolution , released in 1998 , was a rhythm game in which players danced on pressure sensitive pads , in the order dictated by on-screen instructions .
Bemani &apos; s Samba de Amigo , released in 1999 and on Dreamcast in 2000 , featured maraca-shaped , motion sensor controllers .
Artists whose works have been featured in the games have also benefited from royalties and increased publicity , in turn generating further sales of their work .
The success of both expanded the console video game market and its demographics , as well as providing a new source of revenue for artists whose music appeared on the soundtracks .
The game was critically acclaimed , but its abstract style did not allow the player to give a `` performance &apos; &apos; as in other games and thus proved difficult to market .
Citing the downturn in rhythm games , Activision shuttered their Guitar Hero division in February 2011 .
These include a variety of controllers which emulate musical instruments , such as guitars , drums , or maracas .
While songs can be sight read without having performed them before , players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings .
Additional songs could be purchased via the internet and added to Guitar Hero and Rock Band games , generating further revenue .
In some rhythm games , the screen will display an avatar who performs in response to the player &apos; s button-presses .
Harmonix , a company formed from a computer music group at MIT in 1995 , released Frequency in 2001 .
The game reinvigorated the rhythm genre which by this time had begun to stagnate , flooded with Dance Dance Revolution sequels and imitators .
Similarly , DrumMania from 1999 used a drum kit controller and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions , several years before the concept appeared in Rock Band .
The game spawned several sequels , with the franchise earning more than $ 1 billion in sales ; the third installment was the best-selling game in North America in 2007 .
While the franchise continues to receive new arcade versions in Japan , it was never strongly marketed outside of the country , allowing Harmonix to capitalize on the formula several years later with the Western-targeted Guitar Hero .
The genre has been traced back to the electronic game Simon , invented by Howard Morrison and Ralph Baer -LRB- the latter also invented the Magnavox Odyssey -RRB- in 1978 .
Activision has also closed some of its in-house developers , including RedOctane , Neversoft &apos; s Guitar Hero division , and Underground Development , bringing the remaining employees and assets under their own control .
The later PaRappa the Rapper has also been credited as the first rhythm game , as well as one of the first music games in general .
The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper has been deemed the first influential rhythm game , whose basic template forms the core of subsequent games in the genre .
However , saturation of the market in 2009 by numerous spin-offs from the core titles led to a nearly 50 % drop in revenue for music game published , causing them to scale-back plans for further expansion in 2010 .
However , though analysis had expected that United States sales of Guitar Hero 5 and The Beatles : Rock Band to be high , close to or exceeding one million units each in the first month of their release , the resulting sales numbers were lower by nearly half of the projections .
Released the same year , Enix &apos; s Bust a Groove revolved around similar dancing themes to Dance Dance Revolution but employed a more conventional input method .
Gitaroo Mans creator , Keiichi Yano , further created Osu !
More conventional inputs , specifically control pads , may be used however .
Games in the genre primarily focus either on dancing or simulating the playing of musical instruments .
Konami &apos; s Beatmania , released in Japanese arcades in 1997 , was a dj-themed rhythm game which featured buttons laid out like a keyboard along with a rubber pad emulating a record .
The game made use of `` social gaming &apos; &apos; , allowing two player gameplay and providing a spectacle for onlookers .
Publishers and distributors have recognized that by 2010 , most consumers likely have one or more sets of instrument controller hardware at their homes , and that further sales would be primarily driven by software sales and additional content .
Dance Aerobics was released in 1987 , and allowed players to create music by stepping on Nintendo &apos; s Power Pad peripheral .
Doing so will cause the game &apos; s protagonist or avatar to dance or play their instrument correctly , thus achieving a greater score .
Donkey Konga , developed by Namco for Nintendo and released in 2003 -LRB- 2004 in North America -RRB- achieved widespread success due to its use of Nintendo &apos; s Donkey Kong franchise .
In this game , players had to maneuver the protagonist through an obstacle course by pressing buttons at the correct time .
Other rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says , where the player must watch , remember , and repeat complex sequences of button-presses .
Viacom completed its sale of Harmonix in late 2010 to an investment-backed group to allow it to continue developing Rock Band and Dance Central on its own .
A dance mat , for use in dancing games , requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads .
The success of PaRappa the Rapper sparked an emergent popularity of the music game genre .
Analysis of music game sales through October 2010 show net sales of around $ 200 million through October , one-fifth of the revenue for music games for the same period in 2008 , and that the market will likely not break $ 400 million by the end of the year .
The game featured competitive one-on-one `` battles &apos; &apos; and also allowed the player a greater degree of freedom than normally found in rhythm games .
Guitar Hero installments based on specific bands , such as Metallica and Aerosmith , were subsequently published .
It provides lower case parameters only .

The MBR usually contains GRUB stage 1 , but can contain another bootloader which can chain boot GRUB stage 1 from another boot sector such as a partition &apos; s Volume boot record .
This could be another boot manager , such as the Microsoft boot menu , allowing further selection of non-Multiboot operating systems .
GNU GRUB -LRB- short for GNU GRand Unified Bootloader -RRB- is a boot loader package from the GNU Project .
When a computer is turned on , the computer &apos; s BIOS finds the primary bootable device -LRB- usually the computer &apos; s hard disk -RRB- and loads the initial bootstrap program from the master boot record -LRB- MBR -RRB- , the first 512 bytes of the hard disk , then transfers control to this code .
In this case , copies of the other system &apos; s boot programs have been saved by GRUB . Instead of a kernel , the other system is loaded as though it had been started from the MBR .
Stage 1.5 can contain any drivers needed and so easily loads Stage 2 .
Once boot options have been selected , GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control to the kernel .
If this is not available , or the user wishes direct control , GRUB has its own command prompt . The user can then manually specify the boot parameters .
Stage 1 can load Stage 2 directly , but it &apos; s normally set up to load Stage 1.5 . GRUB Stage 1.5 is located in the first 30 kilobytes of hard disk immediately following the MBR and before the first partition .
GRUB is the reference implementation of the Multiboot Specification , which provides a user the choice to boot one of multiple operating systems installed on a computer or select a specific kernel configuration available on a particular operating system &apos; s partitions .
GRUB can be set to automatically load a specified kernel after a user defined timeout .
Alternatively , GRUB can pass control of the boot process to another loader , using chain loading . This is the method used to load operating systems such as Windows , that do not support the Multiboot standard .
Once GRUB has loaded , it presents an interface where the user can select which operating system to boot .
Ficheux is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France .
is a 1995 song written by Bryan Adams , Michael Kamen and Robert John `` Mutt &apos; &apos; Lange for the film of the same year Don Juan DeMarco .
The melody is used as a musical motif throughout the film , and the song is featured three times in the movie , twice performed by other artists in Spanish , and finally performed by Adams himself during the closing credits .
Various women &apos; s groups contacted Adams when the song became popular , which led to his publishing a series of books of photos , with all proceeds going to breast cancer research .
The Adams version of the song , which features flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia , is featured on the soundtrack album and also on the album 18 Til I Die .

Though moai are whole-body statues , they are commonly referred to as `` Easter Island heads &apos; &apos; .
Nearly half are still at Rano Raraku , the main moai quarry , but hundreds were transported from there and set on stone platforms called ahu around the island &apos; s perimeter .
This is partly because of the disproportionate size of most moai heads and partly because , from the invention of photography until the 1950s , the only moai standing on the island were the statues on the slopes of Rano Raraku , many of which are buried to their shoulders .

Despite his best efforts at defending himself , the narrator &apos; s `` over acuteness of the senses , &apos; &apos; which help him hear the heart beating in the floorboards , is actually evidence that he is truly mad .
Only when the eye is finally found open on the final night , penetrating the veil of secrecy , is the murder carried out .
The narrator first admits to hearing death watches in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep .
The narrator dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards , making certain to hide all signs of the crime .
Despite this , he says the idea of murder , `` haunted me day and night &apos; &apos; .
The murder of the eye , then , is a removal of conscience .
The story is driven not by the narrator &apos; s insistence upon his innocence but by insistence on his sanity .
It is unclear , however , if the narrator actually has very acute senses or if he is merely imagining things .
The relationship between the old man and the narrator is ambiguous , as are their names , their occupations , and where they live .
One variety of death watch beetles raps its head against surfaces , presumably as part of a mating ritual , while others emit a ticking sound .
The first word of the story , `` True ! &apos; &apos;
Poe was likely paid only $ 10 .
This sparks the narrator &apos; s need to explain himself in great detail .
If his condition is believed to be true , what he hears at the end of the story may not be the old man &apos; s heart but death watch beetles .
The story was first published in James Russell Lowell &apos; s The Pioneer in January 1843 .
His denial of insanity is based on his systemic actions and precisionâ &apos; &apos; a rational explanation for irrational behavior .
According to superstition , death watches are a sign of impending death .
`` The Tell-Tale Heart &apos; &apos; is widely considered a classic of the Gothic fiction genre and one of Poe &apos; s most famous short stories .
`` The Tell-Tale Heart &apos; &apos; was first published in the Boston-based magazine The Pioneer in January 1843 , edited by James Russell Lowell .
It is speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden , judge , newspaper reporter , doctor or psychiatrist .
The narrator , however , begins to hear a faint noise .
Readers during Poe &apos; s time would have been especially interested amidst the controversy over the insanity defense in the 1840s .
Former United States Poet Laureate Richard Wilbur has suggested that the tale is an allegorical representation of Poe &apos; s poem `` To Science &apos; &apos; .
Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder , the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man &apos; s room , right on the very spot where the body is concealed , yet they suspect nothing , as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner about him .
In fact , that ambiguity adds to the tale as an ironic counter to the strict attention to detail in the plot .
In that case , the `` vulture &apos; &apos; eye of the old man is symbolizing parental surveillance and possibly the paternal principles of right and wrong .
The poem shows the struggle between imagination and science .
The narrator may be a servant of the old man &apos; s or , as is more often assumed , his son .
The opening is an in-progress conversation between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way .
The story was slightly revised when republished in the August 23 , 1845 , edition of the Broadway Journal .
This rationality , however , is undermined by his lack of motivation -LRB- `` Object there was none .
In `` The Tell-Tale Heart , &apos; &apos; the old man represents the scientific rational mind while the narrator is the imaginative .
The story starts in medias res , in the middle of the event .
As the noise grows louder , the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards .
Shocked by the constant beating of the heart and a feeling that not only are the officers aware of the sound , but that they also suspect him , the narrator confesses to killing the old man and tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the body .
The old man with whom he lives has a clouded , pale , blue `` vulture-like &apos; &apos; eye which so distresses the narrator that he plots to murder the old man , though the narrator states that he loves the old man , and hates only the eye .
`` The Tell-Tale Heart &apos; &apos; was reprinted several additional times during Poe &apos; s lifetime .
Like many characters in the Gothic tradition , his nerves dictate his true nature .
Passion there was none . &apos; &apos; -RRB- .
The sound increases steadily , though the officers seem to pay no attention to it .
In the indigenous language , participants called it iki haveve , or `` belly-don &apos; t know , &apos; &apos; meaning , roughly , `` dizziness . &apos; &apos;
The Vailala Madness was a social movement in the Papuan Gulf , in the Territory of Papua beginning in the later part of 1919 and petering out after 1922 .
The Vailala Madness acquired its name from observations of the behavior of people who participated in it , which included glossolalia , shaking and psychosomatic symptoms .
Like many other stegosaurians , it had plates all down its back and spikes on its tail .
The name derives from `` Huayang &apos; &apos; , an alternate name for Sichuan -LRB- the province where it was discovered -RRB- , and `` saurus &apos; &apos; , meaning `` lizard &apos; &apos; .
Like Stegosaurus , however , it bore two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of its tail .
Its skull was broader and had premaxillary teeth in the front of its mouth .
Huayangosaurus was one of the smallest known stegosaurians , at just 4.5 meters in length .
Thus they would have been much less effective heat regulators , one of the postulated functions of plates .
The type species is H. taibaii .
These plates rose vertically along its arched back .
Mounted skeletons of Huayangosaurus are on display at the Zigong Dinosaur Museum in Zigong and the Municipal Museum of Chongqing in Sichuan Province in China .
As it is the most basal stegosaurian , it is placed in within its own family Huayangosauridae .
In Huayangosaurus , the plates were more spike-like than in Stegosaurus .
All later stegosaurians lost these teeth .
Found in the Lower Shaximiao Formation , Huayangosaurus shared the local Middle Jurassic landscape with the sauropods Shunosaurus , Datousaurus , Omeisaurus and Protognathosaurus , the ornithopod Xiaosaurus and the carnivorous Gasosaurus .
Huayangosaurus remains from twelve individual animals were recovered from the Dashanpu Quarry near Zigong in Sichuan , and named by Dong , Tang , and Zhou in 1982 .
Its plates were smaller than those of Stegosaurus , with much less surface area .
Like its more famous relative , Stegosaurus , Huayangosaurus bore the distinctive double row of plates that characterize all the stegosaurians .
Like other stegosaurians , Huayangosaurus was a quadrupedal herbivore with a small skull and a spiked tail .
Two large spikes were above its hips , and may have been used for deterring an attack from above -LRB- considering as it was a fairly short in height compared to later stegosaurians -RRB- .
It is also morphologically distinct from later -LRB- stegosaurid -RRB- forms .
At only 4.5 metres long , it was also much smaller than its famous cousin .
Huayangosaurus is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of China .
It lived during the Bathonian to Callovian stages , around 165 million years ago , some 20 million years before its famous relative , Stegosaurus appeared in North America .
In 1866 the gubernia of AugustÃ w was finally renamed to SuwaÅ ki Gubernia .
On May 2 , 1720 , the town rights were approved by King August II , and the town was allowed to organize one fair a week and four markets a year .
The town was renamed to Sudauen and incorporated directly into the German Reich &apos; s East Prussia .
This led to yet another period of prosperity , with the town &apos; s population rising from 16,780 in 1921 to almost 25,000 in 1935 .
Although the Polish language was still banned from official use , new Polish schools were opened , as well as a Polish-language Tygodnik Suwalski weekly and a library .
Finally , in 1917 , local branches of the Polska Organizacja Wojskowa were created .
After the war , SuwaÅ ki remained a capital of the powiat .
Also , production of wood , lumber , tar and iron ore was started .
After the Partitions of Poland in 1794 the area was annexed by Prussia .
Despite the resistance , almost all of the town &apos; s once 7,000-strong Jewish community was murdered in Nazi concentration camps .
After the January Uprising of 1863 , the new administrational reform was passed to unify the Polish lands with Russia completely .
In 1826 an investment plan was passed and new buildings were started by the Russian authorities .
Between 1806 and 1827 the town &apos; s population almost tripled and reached 3,753 people living in 357 houses .
However , the creation of the SuwaÅ ki Special Economic Zone and the proximity of the Russian and Lithuanian borders opened new possibilities for the local trade and commerce .
In 1820 a new church was built and the following year the first synagogue was opened .
After the Great War broke out , heavy fights for the area erupted .
In addition , the town was granted 18.03 square kilometers of forest that was to be turned into arable land .
After the collapse of the Central Powers in November 1918 , the local commander of the Ober-Ost signed an agreement with the Temporary Council of the SuwaÅ ki Region and de facto allowed for the region to be incorporated into Poland .
The town was divided into 300 lots for future houses and its inhabitants were granted civil rights and exempted from taxes for seven years .
Soon afterward the monastic order built its headquarters in Wigry , where a monastery and a church were built .
In addition , a coat of arms was approved , depicting Saint Roch and Saint Romuald .
In addition , the ecologically clean region started to attract many tourists from all around the world .
In 1796 the monastery in Wigry was dissolved and its property confiscated by the Prussian government .
The status of a powiat capital was briefly withdrawn , but it was reintroduced on January 16 , 1816 , when the AugustÃ w Voivodeship was created and its government was gradually moved to SuwaÅ ki .
During the later stages of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 the town was briefly captured by the Red Army .
In 1835 the government of Tsar Nicholas I decided not to move the capital of the voivodeship to AugustÃ w . Two years later the Voivodeships of Poland were re-designated as gubernias and the town became the capital of the AugustÃ w Gubernia .
By the end of the 18th century , SuwaÅ ki had 1,184 inhabitants and 216 houses .
In 1857 it had 11,273 inhabitants and in 1872 almost 20,000 .
In 1829 a permanent post office was opened in SuwaÅ ki .
Soon SuwaÅ ki became the fourth most populous town in the Kingdom of Poland .
The village was founded by Camaldolese monks , who in 1667 were granted the area surrounding the future town by the Grand Duke of Lithuania and the King of Poland John II Casimir .
To change the town &apos; s architecture and break with its rural past , the town council passed a decree banning the construction of new wooden houses in 1847 .
This period came to an end in 1975 , when a new administrative reform was passed and SuwaÅ ki yet again became the capital of a separate SuwaÅ ki Voivodeship .
19th Century In 1807 SuwaÅ ki became part of the newly formed Duchy of Warsaw and one of the centres of the department of Å omÅ 1 \ / 4 a . After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Congress of Vienna , the area was incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland .
czek financed the paving of most of the town &apos; s streets .
The new owners of the area started fast economic exploitation and development of the forests and brought enough settlers -LRB- mainly from overpopulated Masovia -RRB- to build several new villages in the area .
The war ended on the insistence of the Entente in mid-September -LRB- negotiations took place in SuwaÅ ki in early October -RRB- .
This led to the outbreak of the Sejny Uprising on August 23 , 1919 .
A large part of the population was Jewish .
In addition , between 1840 and 1849 the main Catholic church was refurbished by many of Poland &apos; s most notable architects of the era , including Piotr Aigner , Antonio Corazzi and Enrico Marconi .
To secure the town , the following day the first regular units of the Polish Army entered SuwaÅ ki .
Although most of them were at first destroyed by the Gestapo , by 1942 the area had one of the strongest ZWZ and AK networks .
Newly built factories needed workers and these were brought from all over the world .
During the November Uprising of 1831 the town &apos; s population took part in the struggles against Russia , but the town was pacified by the Russian army on February 11 , 1830 .
Also , in 1931 the new water works and a power plant were built .
However , on October 12 of the same year the Soviets withdrew and transferred the area to the Germans , in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet Alliance .
The number of inhabitants rose rapidly and by the end of the 1970s it was over 36,000 .
The fights for the town and its environs lasted for several days and took the lives of almost 5,000 Soviet soldiers .
In 1835 a police station was built , in 1844 a new town hall and Orthodox and Protestant churches were completed .
Soon afterwards the older town hall was demolished and replaced with a new one , and General JÃ zef ZajÄ
Soon afterward a new marketplace was opened , as well as St. Peter &apos; s and Paul &apos; s hospital and a gymnasium .
During the Polish-Bolshevik War the town was captured by the Communists and after the Battle of Warsaw it was again passed to the Lithuanians , but it was retaken by the Polish Army with negligible losses soon afterwards .
On October 23 , 1944 , the town was captured by the forces of the Soviet 3rd Belarusian Front .
A short Polish-Lithuanian War erupted and for several days limited fights were fought for the control over SuwaÅ ki , Sejny and other towns in the area .
In February 1919 the local inhabitants took part in the first free elections to the Polish Sejm , but soon afterwards the German commanders changed their mind and expelled the Polish military units from the area and in May passed it to Lithuanian authority .
However , the newly built Warsaw-Petersburg railway passed by SuwaÅ ki and the town &apos; s prosperity diminished .
By the end of July the Paris Peace Conference granted the town to Poland and the Lithuanians withdrew from the town , but some of the Polish-inhabited lands were left on the Lithuanian side of the border while several Lithuanian villages were left on the Polish side of the so-called Foch Line .
Finally in 1915 , the Germans broke the Russian front and SuwaÅ ki was put under German occupation .

The film and the documentary about the making of the film , The Balano and the Bark Canoes , give a remarkable testimony to the indigenous struggle to keep their culture alive - or rather revive it in the wake of considerable relative modernization and influence of white -LRB- ` balano &apos; -RRB- cultural imposition .
Northeast Arnhem Land is home to the indigenous Yolngu people , one of the largest Indigenous groups in Australia , and one who have succeeded in maintaining a vigorous traditional indigenous culture .
Its administrative center is the town of Nhulunbuy , the fourth-largest population center in the Northern Territory .
The climate of Arnhem Land is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season .
They also depict axes , and detailed paintings of aircraft and ships .
Gove is the site of large-scale bauxite mining with an associated alumina refinery .
The Malays and Macassans are believed to have had contact with the coastal Aboriginal groups and traded with them prior to European settlement of Australia .
One remote shelter , several hundred kilometres from Darwin , has a painting of the wharf at Darwin , including buildings and boats , and Europeans with hats and pipes , some apparently without hands -LRB- which they have in their trouser pockets -RRB- .
This was a legacy of Yolngu trade links with the people of Makassar on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi .
The major centres are Jabiru on the Kakadu National Park border , Maningrida at the Liverpool River mouth , and Nhulunbuy -LRB- also known as Gove -RRB- in the far north-east , on the Gove Peninsula .
Some of these record the early years of European explorers and settlers , sometimes in such detail that Martini-Henry rifles can be identified .
The 2006 film Ten Canoes captures life in Arnhem Land through a story tapping into the aboriginal mythic past ; it was co-directed by one of the indigenous cast members .
The community of Gunbalanya -LRB- previously known as Oenpelli -RRB- in Western Arnhem Land is also notable for bark painting .
It is located in the north-eastern corner of the territory and is around 500 km from the territory capital Darwin .
The Aboriginal community of Yirrkala , just outside Nhulunbuy , is internationally known for bark paintings , promoting the rights of Indigenous Australians , and as the origin of the yidaki , or didgeridoo .
Arnhem Land is also notable for Aboriginal rock-art , some of the finest examples of which can be found at Ubirr Rock , Injalak Hill , and in the Canon Hill area .
The area extends from Port Roper on the Gulf of Carpentaria around the coast to the East Alligator River , where it adjoins Kakadu National Park .
Near the East Alligator River crossing , a figure was painted of a man carrying a gun and wearing his hair in long pigtails down his back ; the latter identified him historically as a Chinese labourer brought to Darwin in the late 19th century .
The explorer Matthew Flinders named the region after the Dutch ship Arnhem , which was used to explore the coast in 1623 .
Declared an Aboriginal Reserve in 1931 , it remains one of the largest Aboriginal Reserves in Australia and is perhaps best known for its isolation , the art of its people , and the strong continuing traditions of its Indigenous inhabitants .
The region has an area of 97,000 kmÂ which also covers the area of Kakadu National Park , and a population of 16,230 .
One Yolngu prehistoric stone arrangement at Maccasans Beach near Yirrkala shows the layout of the Macassan praus used for trepang -LRB- sea cucumber -RRB- fishing in the area .
Temperatures do not fluctuate widely throughout the year , though it can range from overnight lows of 15 degrees Celsius in the dry season -LRB- April to September -RRB- to daily highs of 33 degrees Celsius in the wet season -LRB- October to March -RRB- .
The Arnhem Land Region is one of the five regions of the Northern Territory of Australia .
The trading relationship predated European settlement by some 200 years .
Data integrity is data that has a complete or whole structure .
Normally , a plain box table -LRB- with no `` class = &apos; &apos; -RRB- can be sized to any width up to `` 100 % &apos; &apos; without triggering a bottom scrollbar .
Note that a full-screen table of width = 101 % -LRB- or higher -RRB- , always triggers a bottom scrollbar , as expected , because 101 % -RRB- 100 -LRB- the full window width -RRB- .
A similar complex issue is the use of subheaders -LRB- &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; -RRB- inside a template , and determining which page contains that labeled section for editing , because appearing on a formatted page does not mean the heading exists inside that page , just inside the template displayed for that page .
When sized to 99 % or 100 % , those class = infobox formats have triggered a bottom scollbar -LRB- since 2008 , as of March 2009 -RRB- , appearing along the bottom of the window .
Normally , a plain table -LRB- with no `` class = &apos; &apos; -RRB- can be sized to any width up to `` 100 % &apos; &apos; without triggering a bottom scrollbar .
To avoid this situation , use :
The over-wide display has been caused by automatic extra-margin padding , as either : wider margin-right for class = wikitable , or wider margin-left for infoboxes .
One man &apos; s bug is another man &apos; s `` clever feature &apos; &apos; when the padding is added inside other tables , when formatting a table-within-a-table , etc .
A plain table -LRB- with no `` class = &apos; &apos; -RRB- can be resized up to 100 % without triggering a bottom scrollbar .
These problems of nesting are related to side-effects of recursion .
To avoid this situation , use : : : : class = wikitable style = `` width : 99 % ; margin-right : 0 &apos; &apos; The option for `` margin-right : 0 &apos; &apos; removes the right-side margin padding outside the box , rather than having a margin of 1em or 20px , or such .
The problem of over-wide tables occurs at the top level , when 100 % is the entire window , with no `` outside space &apos; &apos; to have padded .
: : : class = infobox style = `` width : 99 % ; margin-left : 0 &apos; &apos; The option for `` margin-left : 0 &apos; &apos; removes the left-side margin padding outside the infobox , rather than having a margin of 1em or 20px , or such .
The problem does not occur for other tables , without the keyword `` class = &apos; &apos; .
Instead , the table padding generated by the template is the same , whether viewing the template in stand-alone mode , or when transcluded into another page .
The issue of determining `` top-level tables &apos; &apos; is complicated by the use of templates : a table coded inside a template might seem to be a top-level table .
Perhaps the full-name of the essay could be : `` 98-percent table-width anomaly triggering bottom scroll-bars for top-level , CSS-class tables &apos; &apos; .
However , the various styles for `` class = infobox &apos; &apos; add an implicit left-side margin-left padding that fits okay up to 98 % width .
This issue is about the top-level tables on a page , not about tables -LRB- with width = 100 % -RRB- inside other tables .
However , if the template were invoked inside an outer table , then the result would generate nested tables .
As a final reminder : The scrollbar problem only occurs for top-level tables in CSS classes , such as class = wikitable or class = infobox .
Although some might wish to consider the default limitation of CSS-class tables -LRB- to width = 98 % -RRB- as a bug , when tables are nested within other tables , then a wikitable of 100 % - width will still add the same right-side padding as at width 50 % , 80 % or 98 % .
However , the styles for `` class = wikitable &apos; &apos; or `` wikitable sortable &apos; &apos; have added an implicit right-side margin-right padding that fits okay up to 98 % width .
This essay , WP : 98 percent table width anomaly addresses the issue of some tables -LRB- since 2008 , as of June 2009 -RRB- , with class = wikitable or class = infobox triggering the bottom scroll bar when width is set above 98 % .
Because of the relative viewpoint , the situation is termed an `` anomaly &apos; &apos; .
When sized to 99 % or 100 % , those class = wikitable formats have triggered a bottom scollbar -LRB- since 2008 , as of June 2009 -RRB- , appearing along the bottom of the window .
It came into existence in the 12th century as the Margraviate of Baden and subsequently split into different lines , which were unified in 1771 . It became the much-enlarged Grand Duchy of Baden through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803 â `` 06 and remained a sovereign country until it joined the German Empire in 1871 , remaining a Grand Duchy until 1918 when it became part of the Weimar Republic as the Republic of Baden .
The northern half of the old Baden was combined with northern WÃ 1 \ / 4 rttemberg as part of the American military zone and formed the state of WÃ 1 \ / 4 rttemberg-Baden .
This southern half of Baden was declared in its 1947 constitution to be the true successor of the old Baden .
Due to the traditional rivalry between the populations of Baden and WÃ 1 \ / 4 rttemberg , there was a strong opposition in Baden -LRB- predominantly in the South -RRB- against the unification of the two initially independent LÃ nder .
In 1952 Baden merged with WÃ 1 \ / 4 rttemberg-Baden and WÃ 1 \ / 4 rttemberg-Hohenzollern -LRB- southern WÃ 1 \ / 4 rttemberg and the former Prussian exclave of Hohenzollern -RRB- to form Baden-W Ã 1 \ / 4 rttemberg .
After World War II in 1945 , the French military government created the state of Baden -LRB- originally known as `` South Baden &apos; &apos; -RRB- out of the southern half of the former Baden , with Freiburg as capital .
The U.S. State of North Carolina is divided into 100 counties .
The other , hidden sex organs are referred to as the secondary genitalia or internal genitalia .
The Latin term genitalia , sometimes anglicized as genital area , is used to describe the externally visible sex organs , known as primary genitalia or external genitalia : in males , the penis and scrotum ; and in females , the clitoris and vulva .
They were described in 1936 by Alan Turing .
A Turing machine that is able to simulate any other Turing machine is called a universal Turing machine -LRB- UTM , or simply a universal machine -RRB- .
The `` Turing &apos; &apos; machine was described by Alan Turing in 1936 , who called it an `` a -LRB- utomatic -RRB- - machine &apos; &apos; .
Common equivalent models are the multi-tape Turing machine , multi-track Turing machine , machines with input and output , and the non-deterministic Turing machine -LRB- NDTM -RRB- as opposed to the deterministic Turing machine -LRB- DTM -RRB- for which the action table has at most one entry for each combination of symbol and state .

Freedom of information may also refer to the right to privacy in the context of the Internet and information technology .
Freedom of information is an extension of freedom of speech , a fundamental human right recognized in international law , which is today understood more generally as freedom of expression in any medium , be it orally , in writing , print , through the Internet or through art forms .
Freedom of information may also concern censorship in an information technology context , i.e. the ability to access Web content , without censorship or restrictions .
Freedom of information -LRB- or information freedom -RRB- refers to the protection of the right to freedom of expression with regards to the Internet and information technology -LRB- see also , digital rights -RRB- .
As with the right to freedom of expression , the right to privacy is a recognized human right and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right .
This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content , but also the means of expression .
Sturt &apos; s Desert Pea -LRB- described as Clianthus formosus -RRB- was adopted as the floral emblem of the state of South Australia on 23 November 1961 . The iconic status of Sturt &apos; s Desert Pea in Australia , and particularly in South Australia , has ensured its use as a popular subject in artwork and photography , as well as a decorative motif , and in a range of commercial uses .
Eukelade belongs to the Carme group , made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165 Â .
Eukelade is about 4 kilometres in diameter , and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,484 Mm in 735.200 days , at an inclination of 164 Â to the ecliptic -LRB- 165 Â to Jupiter &apos; s equator -RRB- , in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2829 .
It was named in March 2005 after Eukelade , described by some Greek writers as one of the Muses , and thus a daughter of Zeus -LRB- Jupiter -RRB- .

According to Christopher Witcombe , `` the ironic identification of these figurines as ` Venus &apos; pleasantly satisfied certain assumptions at the time about the primitive , about women , and about taste &apos; &apos; .
They are collectively referred to as Venus figurines , although they pre-date the mythological figure of Venus by millennia .
The nickname , urging a comparison to the classical image of `` Venus , &apos; &apos; causes resistance in some modern analyses .
The Venus of Willendorf , also known as the Woman of Willendorf , is an 11 c high statuette of a female figure estimated to have been made between 24,000 and 22,000 BCE .
`` Venus of Willendorf &apos; &apos; is part of the collection of the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna .
Since this figure &apos; s discovery and naming , several similar statuettes and other forms of art have been discovered .
It was discovered in 1908 by archaeologist Josef Szombathy at a paleolithic site near Willendorf , a village in Lower Austria near the city of Krems .
The word derives from the Persian word bÄ zÄ r , the etymology of which goes back to the Middle Persian word baha-char -LRB- Ø Ù Ø Ú Ø Ø -RRB- , meaning `` the place of prices &apos; &apos; .

Many Italian Futurists supported Fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural , archaic South .
This committed them to a `` universal dynamism &apos; &apos; , which was to be directly represented in painting .
`` Ironman &apos; &apos; -RRB- films ; Marinetti &apos; s legacy is also obvious in philosophical ingredients of transhumanism , especially in Europe .
After the Second World War , many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime .
The founder of Futurism and its most influential personality was the Italian writer Filippo Tommaso Marinetti .
Ridley Scott consciously evoked the designs of Sant ` Elia in Blade Runner .
They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation , praised originality , `` however daring , however violent &apos; &apos; , bore proudly `` the smear of madness &apos; &apos; , dismissed art critics as useless , rebelled against harmony and good taste , swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art , and gloried in science .
The Futurists &apos; association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work , especially in architecture .
He was soon joined by the painters Umberto Boccioni , Carlo CarrÃ , Giacomo Balla , Gino Severini and the composer Luigi Russolo .
Futurism was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century .
Futurism influenced many other twentieth century art movements , including Art Deco , Vorticism , Constructivism , Surrealism and Dada .
Marinetti launched the movement in his Futurist Manifesto , which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in La gazzetta dell &apos; Em ilia , an article then reproduced in the French daily newspaper Le Figaro on 20 February 1909 .
Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party -LRB- Partito Politico Futurista -RRB- in early 1918 , which was absorbed into Benito Mussolini &apos; s Fasci di combattimento in 1919 , making Marinetti one of the first members of the National Fascist Party .
Currently , there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in Chicago , New York , and Montreal .
Like the Fascists , the Futurists were Italian nationalists , radicals , admirers of violence , and were opposed to parliamentary democracy .
Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old , especially political and artistic tradition .
The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic program , which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting .
Futurism has produced several reactions , including the literary genre of cyberpunk â &apos; &apos; in which technology was often treated with a critical eye â &apos; &apos; whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the Internet , such as Stelarc and Mariko Mori , produce work which comments on futurist ideals .
The Futurists admired speed , technology , youth and violence , the car , the airplane and the industrial city , all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature , and they were passionate nationalists .
A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement began in 1988 with the creation of the Neo-Futurist style of theater in Chicago , which utilizes Futurism &apos; s focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theater .

The cascade is composed of many plasma proteins , synthesized in the liver , primarily by hepatocytes .
Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection or irritation .
The innate system is thought to constitute an evolutionarily older defense strategy , and is the dominant immune system found in plants , fungi , insects , and in primitive multicellular organisms .
The flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth .
This means that the cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in a generic way , but unlike the adaptive immune system , it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host .
The complement system is a biochemical cascade of the immune system that helps , or â complementsâ , the ability of antibodies to clear pathogens or mark them for destruction by other cells .
Inflammation is stimulated by chemical factors released by injured cells and serves to establish a physical barrier against the spread of infection , and to promote healing of any damaged tissue following the clearance of pathogens .
Also , mucus traps infectious agents .
Chemical factors produced during inflammation -LRB- histamine , bradykinin , serotonin , leukotrienes also prostaglandins -RRB- sensitize pain receptors , cause vasodilation of the blood vessels at the scene , and attract phagocytes , especially neutrophils .
Innate immune systems provide immediate defense against infection , and are found in all classes of plant and animal life .
In the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract , movement due to peristalsis or cilia helps removing infectious agents .
Neutrophils then trigger other parts of the immune system by releasing factors that summon other leukocytes and lymphocytes .
The proteins work together to :
Elements of the complement cascade can be found in many nonmammalian species including plants , birds , fish and some species of invertebrates .
The innate immune system comprises the cells and mechanisms that defend the host from infection by other organisms , hi in a non-specific manner .
The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that is very impermeable to most infectious agents , acting as the first line of defense against invading organisms .
The gut flora can prevent the colonization of pathogenic bacteria by secreting toxic substances or by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients or attachment to cell surfaces .

Joseph Carey Merrick -LRB- 5 August 1862 â `` 11 April 1890 -RRB- , sometimes incorrectly referred to as John Merrick , was an English man with severe deformities who was exhibited as a human curiosity named the Elephant Man .
Nevertheless , he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on Whitechapel Road .
Merrick wrote to Torr , who came and visited him at the workhouse . Torr decided that he could make money exhibiting Merrick , although to retain Merrick &apos; s novelty , he would have to be a traveling exhibit .
In Belgium , Merrick was robbed by his road manager and abandoned in Brussels .
When he was 11 , his mother died and his father soon remarried .
He became well known in London society after he went to live at the London Hospital .
Rejected by his father and stepmother , he left home . In late 1879 , aged 17 , Merrick entered the Leicester Union workhouse .
Frederick Treves first met Merrick that November at a private viewing , before Norman opened the shop for the day .
In 1884 , after four years in the workhouse , Merrick contacted a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him .
Soon after Merrick &apos; s visits to the hospital , Tom Norman &apos; s shop was closed by the police and Merrick &apos; s managers sent him to tour in Europe .
Merrick left school at 12 , and had difficulty finding employment .
Treves came and took Merrick back to the London Hospital .

During the Middle Ages organizations such as the Hanseatic League , aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade , also became increasingly prominent .
With the advent of modern times , commercial activity shifted from the major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation states .
This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international free trade agreements , which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions .
Maritime trade along the Spice route became prominent during the Middle Ages ; nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route .
Europe &apos; s early trading routes included the Amber Road , which served as a dependable network for long distance trade .
Historically , the period from 1250 BCE -- 153 CE saw the Western Asian , Mediterranean , Chinese and Indian societies develop major transportation networks for trade .

This forces reproduction to be suppressed in all but the alpha-male and - female ; this way , the non-reproducing members of the pack can focus all of their care on one litter rather than several unsuccessful ones .
The path to each of these stages of sociality is highly varied between different groups of animals .
Examples include canines that live in packs , numerous insects , especially hymenoptera , humans , many birds , chimpanzees , and many other animals that display social behavior .
However , modern sociobiology has been able to explain many cases of social behavior .
Among the Vespidae , it is thought that the pressures of predators and parasites selected subsocial behavior ; that is , when the mother wasp stays in her brood cell to watch over her larva , it becomes less likely that parasites will be successful in preying on the nest .
Sociality itself can be seemingly contrary to the theory of Darwinian evolution .
Presociality is a phenomenon in which animals exhibit more than just sexual interactions with members of the same species , but fall short of qualifying as eusocial .
Other pressures can force the evolution of presociality .
A lack of resources available to pack-wolves makes it possible to raise only one litter , even with the aid of the pack .
Presocial behavior is much more common in the animal kingdom than complete eusociality .
Darwin saw the phenomenon as a serious challenge for his theory to overcome .
That is , presocial animals can display communal living , cooperative care of young , or primitive reproductive division of labor , but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals , those being

Monophysitism and Eutyches were again rejected at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 .
Monophysitism &apos; s theological point of view is also rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Churches , but was widely accepted in Syria , Egypt and the Levant , leading to many tensions in the Coptic period of the Byzantine Empire .
After Nestorianism , taught by Nestorius , Archbishop of Constantinople , was rejected at the First Council of Ephesus , Eutyches , an archimandrite at Constantinople , emerged with diametrically opposite views .
Later , monothelitism -- the belief that Christ was 2 natures in 1 person except that he only had a divine will and no human will -- was developed as an attempt to bridge the gap between the monophysite and the Chalcedonian position , but it too was rejected by the members of the Chalcedonian synod , despite at times having the support of the Byzantine emperors and once escaping the condemnation of a Pope of Rome , Honorius I. Some are of the opinion that monothelitism was at one time held by the Maronites , but the Maronite community , for the most part , dispute this , stating that they have never been out of communion with the Catholic Church .
Miaphysitism , the christology of the Oriental Orthodox churches , is considered by Chalcedonian churches as a variant of monophysitism , but these churches view their theology as distinct from monophysitism and anathematize Eutyches .

Eucalyptus regnans is the tallest of all flowering plants , and possibly the tallest of all plants , although no living specimens can make that claim .
The wood is easy to work and the grain is straight with long , clear sections without knots .
They grow very quickly , at more than a metre a year , and can reach 65 m in 50 years , with an average life-span of 400 years .
Seedling densities of up to 2.5 million per hectare have been recorded after a major fire .
The tallest measured living specimen , named Centurion , stands 99.6 metres tall in Tasmania .
If , however , no fires regenerate an area , the trees die off after about 400 years and are replaced by other species .
It occurs in cool , deep soiled , mostly mountainous areas to 1000 m altitude with high rainfall of over 1200 m per year .
The wood works reasonably well for steam-bending .
Competition and natural thinning eventually reduces the mature tree density to about 30 to 40 individuals per hectare .
Because it takes roughly 20 years for seedlings to reach sexual maturity , repeated fires in the same area can cause local extinctions .
The seeds are released from their woody capsules -LRB- gumnuts -RRB- by heat and for successful germination the seedlings require a high level of light , much more than reaches the forest floor when there is a mature tree canopy .
16 living trees in Tasmania have been reliably measured in excess of 90 m .
Eucalyptus regnans , known variously by the common names Mountain Ash , Victorian Ash , Swamp Gum , Tasmanian Oak or Stringy Gum , is a species of Eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia , in Tasmania and Victoria .

Severe fires can kill all the trees in a forest , prompting a massive release of seed to take advantage of the nutrients in the ash bed .
Primary uses are sawlogging and woodchipping .

Her marriage to the Duke of Chartres took place at the Palace of Versailles on 5 April 1769 in a lavish ceremony which all of the princes du sang attended .
The day before his father and brothers were arrested in France , the duc de Chartres rushed to Tournai , near the French border , where his sister AdÃ laÃ de and Mme de Genlis had been living since Philippe Ã galitÃ had made them emigrate in November 1792 .
Louise Marie AdÃ laÃ de de Bourbon , -LRB- 13 March 1753 -- 23 June 1821 -RRB- , was the daughter of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon , Duke of PenthiÃ vre and of Maria Teresa d &apos;Este .
Later , the two were transferred to the prison of Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille , where they were soon joined by the duc de Montpensier who had been arrested while serving as an officer in the Army of the Alps .
Styled Mademoiselle d &apos;Ivoy initially and , as a young girl , until her marriage , Mademoiselle de PenthiÃ vre -LRB- derived from the duchy inherited by her father -RRB- .
Although Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de was much in love with her OrlÃ ans cousin , Louis XV warned PenthiÃ vre against such a marriage because of the reputation of the young Duke of Chartres as a libertine .
On 5 April 1791 , Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de left her husband , and went to live with her father at the chÃ cents teau de Bizy overlooking the town of Vernon in Normandy .
After legal battles which lasted until her death , the bulk of her inheritance was eventually recovered .
Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de , Rouzet and the OrlÃ ans exiled in Spain returned to France in 1814 at the time of the first Bourbon Restoration .
Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de was born on 13 March 1753 at the HÃ tel de Toulouse , the family residence in Paris since 1712 , when her grandfather , the Count of Toulouse , bought it from Louis PhÃ lypeaux de La VrilliÃ re .
She died in her castle at Ivry-sur-Seine on 23 June 1821 , after having suffered from breast cancer .
Rouzet accompanied them to the Spanish border and managed to secretly join them in Barcelona where he became her chancellor , and she obtained for him the title of comte de Folmont .
Siding with the radical group called The Mountain -LRB- La Montagne -RRB- , he was from the very beginning suspect in the eyes of the Girondists -LRB- Girondins -RRB- , who wanted all the Bourbons to be banished from France .
Upon the execution of her husband , Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de , now known as `` Veuve Ã galitÃ &apos; &apos; -LRB- Widow Ã galitÃ -RRB- , was incarcerated at the Luxembourg Palace , which had been transformed into a prison during the Revolution .
She married Louis Philippe II , Duke of OrlÃ ans , the regicide Philippe Ã galitÃ , and was the mother of France &apos; s last king , Louis Philippe I , King of the French .
They both appreciated her intelligence and , in July 1779 , she became the governess of the couple &apos; s twin daughters born in 1777 .
There she met the man who was to become the `` love of her life &apos; &apos; , a former member of the National Convention named Jacques-Marie Rouzet , who had been imprisoned at the fall of the Girondins .
The style of Mademoiselle de PenthiÃ vre had been previoulsy borne by her sister `` Marie Louise de Bourbon &apos; &apos; -LRB- 1751 â `` 1753 -RRB- who died six months after Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de &apos; s birth .
After the romantic affair was over , FÃ licitÃ remained in the service of Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de at the Palais-Royal , a trusted friend to both Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de and Philippe .
After their arrest in Paris , Philippe Ã galitÃ and his son , the comte de Beaujolais , were imprisoned in the Abbey prison -LRB- prison de l &apos;Abbaye -RRB- in Paris .
Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de was exiled to Spain , as was her sister-in-law Bathilde d &apos;Orl Ã ans , the last princesse de CondÃ .
However , the OrlÃ ans &apos; mind changed when the prince de Lamballe &apos; s death left his sister sole heiress to the family fortune .
Passionate at first , the liaison cooled within a few months and , by the spring of 1773 , was reported to be `` dead &apos; &apos; .
The fate of the OrlÃ ans family was sealed when Marie-Ad Ã laÃ de &apos; s eldest son , the duc de Chartres , `` GÃ nÃ ral Ã galitÃ &apos; &apos; in the Army of the North commanded by Charles FranÃ ois Dumouriez , sought political asylum from the Austrians in March 1793 .
After Rouzet , who after his liberation had become a member of the Council of Five Hundred , succeeded , in 1796 , to secure her liberation and that of her two sons still imprisoned in Marseille , the two always remained together and lived in Paris until 1797 , when a decree banished the remaining members of the House of Bourbon from France .
Her marriage to Louis Philippe Joseph d &apos;Orl Ã ans , Duke of Chartres , son of the Duke of OrlÃ ans , had been envisaged earlier and , while the Duke of PenthiÃ vre saw in it the opportunity for his daughter to marry into the family of the First Prince of the Blood , the OrlÃ ans did not want a union with an illegitimate branch of the royal family .
During the first few months of their marriage , the couple appeared devoted to each other , but the duke went back to the life of libertinage he had led before his marriage .
It is during the summer of 1772 , a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter , that began Philippe &apos; s secret liaison with one of her ladies-in-waiting , StÃ phanie FÃ licitÃ Ducrest de St-Albin , comtesse de Genlis , the niece of Madame de Montesson , the morganatic wife of Philippe &apos; s father .
In September 1792 , having sided with the Revolution , the Duke of OrlÃ ans was elected to the National Convention under the name of Philippe Ã galitÃ .
At the death of her brother , Louis Alexandre de Bourbon , prince de Lamballe , she became the wealthiest heiress in France prior to the French Revolution .
On 6 April , all the members of the OrlÃ ans family still remaining in France were arrested .

On the morning of 30 January 1933 , Hindenburg swore Hitler in as Chancellor at the Presidential Palace .
When the budget was defeated in July 1930 , BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning arranged for Hindenburg to sign the budget into law by invoking Article 48 .
The ceremony at the Kroll Opera House had the effect of reassuring many Germans , especially conservative Germans , that life would be fine under the new regime .
Though Hindenburg was in increasingly bad health , the Nazis made sure that whenever Hindenburg did appear in public it was in Hitlerâ s company .
Though 84 years old and in poor health , Hindenburg was persuaded to run for re-election in 1932 , as he was considered the only candidate who could defeat Adolf Hitler .
Hindenburg retired again in 1919 , but returned to public life one more time in 1925 to be elected as the second President of Germany .
At the opening of the new Reichstag on 21 March 1933 , at the Kroll Opera House , the Nazis staged an elaborate ceremony , in which Hindenburg played the leading part , appearing alongside Hitler during the event , that was meant to mark the continuity between the old Prussian-German tradition and the new Nazi state .
On 23 March 1933 , Hindenburg signed the Enabling Act of 1933 into law , which gave decrees issued by the cabinet -LRB- in effect , Hitler -RRB- the force of law .
Under a `` Presidential &apos; &apos; government the head of government -LRB- in this case , the chancellor -RRB- , is responsible to the head of state , and not a legislative body .
Hitler &apos; s first act as Chancellor was to ask Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag so that the Nazis and DNVP could increase their number of seats and pass the Enabling Act . Hindenburg agreed to this request .
On 31 May 1932 , Hindenburg dismissed BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning as Chancellor and replaced him with the man that Schleicher had suggested , Franz von Papen .
The day before Hindenburg &apos; s death , Hitler flew to Neudeck and visited him .
The only time Hindenburg ever objected to a Nazi bill occurred in early April 1933 when the Reichstag had passed a Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service that called for the immediate dismissal of all Jewish civil servants at the Reich , Land , and municipal levels .
After refusing Hitlerâ s demands for the Chancellorship , Hindenburg had a press release issued of his meeting with Hitler that implied that Hitler had demanded absolute power and had his knuckles rapped by the President for making such a demand .
Schleicher and Papen both believed that the Nazis would win the majority of the seats and would support Papen &apos; s government .
In the `` Government of National Concentration &apos; &apos; headed by Hitler , the Nazis were in the minority .
In the September 1930 elections the Nazis achieved an electoral breakthrough , gaining 17 percent of the vote , up from 2 percent in 1928 .
Paul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg , known universally as Paul von Hindenburg -LRB- ; 2 October 1847 â `` 2 August 1934 -RRB- was a German field marshal , statesman , and politician , and served as the second President of Germany from 1925 to 1934 .
Hindenburg refused to sign this bill into law until it had been amended to exclude all Jewish veterans of World War I , Jewish civil servants who served in the civil service during the war and those Jewish civil servants whose fathers were veterans .
Hindenburg , old and senile as well as bedridden from being very sick , thought he was meeting Kaiser Wilhelm II , and he called Hitler `` Your Majesty &apos; &apos; when Hitler first walked into the room .
The first blow occurred in May 1932 , when Schleicher had Hindenburg dismiss Groener as Defense Minister in a way that was designed to humiliate both Groener and BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning .
In the first round of the election held in March 1932 , Hindenburg emerged as the frontrunner , but failed to gain a majority .
He was aided by the support of the Bavarian People &apos; s Party -LRB- BVP -RRB- , which switched its support from Marx , and the refusal of the Communist Party of Germany -LRB- KPD -RRB- to withdraw its candidate , Ernst ThÃ lmann .
The `` 25 / 48 / 53 formula &apos; &apos; referred to the three articles of the Constitution that could make a `` Presidential government &apos; &apos; possible :
After the November elections , there ensued another round of fruitless talks between Hindenburg , Papen , Schleicher on the one hand and Hitler and the other Nazi leaders on the other .
To break the political stalemate , Papen proposed that Hindenburg declare martial law and do away with democracy via a presidential coup . Papen won over Oskar Hindenburg with this idea and the two persuaded Hindenburg for once to forgo his oath to the Constitution and go along with this plan .
The younger Hindenburg served as his father &apos; s aide-de-camp and controlled politicians &apos; access to the President .
However , the pressure from MeiÃ ner , Papen and the younger Hindenburg was relentless and by the end of January , the President had decided to appoint Hitler Chancellor .
After the 1930 elections , BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning continued to govern largely through Article 48 ; his government was kept afloat by the support of the Social Democrats who voted not to cancel his Article 48 bills in order not to have another election that could only benefit the Nazis and the Communists .
Schleicher &apos; s idea was to have Hindenburg appoint a man of Schleicher &apos; s choosing as chancellor , who would rule under the provisions of Article 48 .
After the presidential elections had ended , Schleicher held a series of secret meetings with Hitler in May 1932 , and thought that he had obtained a `` gentleman &apos; s agreement &apos; &apos; in which Hitler had agreed to support the new `` presidential government &apos; &apos; that Schleicher was building .
The famed zeppelin Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire in 1937 was named in his honor , as was the Hindenburgdamm , a causeway joining the island of Sylt to mainland Schleswig-Holstein that was built during his time in office .
Papen won over Oskar Hindenburg with this idea and the two persuaded Hindenburg for once to forgo his oath to the Constitution and go along with this plan .
BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning &apos; s first official act was to introduce a budget calling for steep spending cuts and steep tax increases .
In response , Papen had Hindenburg dissolve the Reichstag for elections in November 1932 .
By this time , Schleicher had decided that BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning had become an obstacle to his plans and was already plotting BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning &apos; s downfall .
The upshot of these intrigues was the fall of MÃ 1 \ / 4 llerâ s government in March 1930 and Hindenburg &apos; s appointment of BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning as Chancellor .
Largely because of his status as Germany &apos; s greatest war hero , Hindenburg won the election in the second round of voting held on April 26 , 1925 .
It was he who came up with the idea of Presidential government based on the so-called `` 25 / 48 / 53 formula &apos; &apos; .
In the runoff election of April 1932 , Hindenburg defeated Hitler for the Presidency .
Following Hindenburg &apos; s death , Hitler merged the presidency with the office of Chancellor under the title of Leader and Chancellor -LRB- FÃ 1 \ / 4 hrer und Reichskanzler -RRB- , making himself Germany &apos; s Head of State and Head of government , thereby completing the progress of Gleichschaltung .
In early February 1933 , Papen asked for and received an Article 48 bill signed into law that sharply limited freedom of the press .
According to the minutes :
Besides Hitler , the only other Nazi ministers were Hermann GÃ ring and Wilhelm Frick .
Hindenburg played a supporting but key role in the Nazi Machtergreifung -LRB- Seizure of Power -RRB- in 1933 .
After the Reichstag fire , Hindenburg , at Hitler &apos; s urging , signed into law the Reichstag Fire Decree .
Hitler for his part , remained adamant that Hindenburg give him the Chancellorship and nothing else .
Schleicher , who had come to see Papen as a threat , blocked the martial law move by unveiling the results of a war games exercise that showed if martial law was declared , the Nazi SA and the Communist Red Front Fighters would rise up , the Poles would invade and the Reichswehr would be unable to cope .
In 1925 , Hindenburg had no interest in running for public office .
Hindenburg remained in office until his death at the age of 86 from lung cancer at his home in Neudeck , East Prussia on 2 August 1934 -LRB- exactly two months short of his 87th birthday -RRB- .
When the Reichstag voted to repeal the budget , BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning had Hindenburg dissolve the Reichstag , just two years into its mandate , and reapprove the budget through the Article 48 mechanism .
During 1933 and 1934 , Hitler was very aware of the fact that President Hindenburg was his only superior as well as the Supreme Commander-In-Chief of the German armed forces , and given that Hindenburg was a revered figure in the German Army , that if the President decided to remove Hitler as Chancellor , there was little doubt that the Reichswehr would side with Hindenburg .
During the winter of 1929 â `` 1930 , however , Schleicher had more success . After a series of secret meetings attended by MeiÃ ner , Schleicher , and Heinrich BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning , the parliamentary leader of the Catholic Center Party -LRB- Zentrum -RRB- , Schleicher and MeiÃ ner were able to persuade BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning to go along with the scheme for `` presidential government &apos; &apos; .
Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , one of the leaders of the DNVP , visited Hindenburg and urged him to run .
In response , Papen had Hindenburg dissolve the Reichstag for elections in November 1932 . The second Reichstag elections saw the Nazi vote drop from 37 percent to 32 percent , though the Nazis once again remained the largest party in the Reichstag .
Hindenburg died the following year , after which Hitler declared the office of President vacant and , as `` FÃ 1 \ / 4 hrer und Reichskanzler &apos; &apos; , made himself head of state .
The first attempt to establish a `` presidential government &apos; &apos; had occurred in 1926 â `` 1927 , but foundered for lack of political support .
The Communist Party of Germany also made striking gains , albeit not so great .
Hitler was enraged by this press release .
The minutes of the meeting were kept by Otto MeiÃ ner , the Chief of the Presidential Chancellery .
These advisers included his son , Oskar , Otto MeiÃ ner , General Wilhelm Groener , and General Kurt von Schleicher .
`` The Government of Barons &apos; &apos; , as Papen &apos; s government was known , openly had as its objective the destruction of German democracy .
Hindenburg was originally buried in the yard of the castle-like Tannenberg Memorial near Tannenberg , East Prussia -LRB- today : StÄ bark , Poland -RRB- , on 7 August 1934 during a large state funeral , five days after his death .
In a meeting between Hindenburg and Hitler held on 13 August 1932 , in Berlin , Hindenburg firmly rejected Hitler &apos; s demands for the Chancellorship .
In accordance with Schleicher &apos; s `` gentleman &apos; s agreement &apos; &apos; , Hindenburg dissolved the Reichstag and set new elections for July 1932 .
Though Hindenburg ran during the second round of the elections as a non-party independent , he was generally regarded as the conservative candidate .
Like BrÃ 1 \ / 4 ning &apos; s government , Papen &apos; s government was a `` presidential government &apos; &apos; that governed through the use of Article 48 .
If the Reichstag should threaten to annul any laws so passed , Hindenburg could counter with the threat of dissolution .
When the Reichstag convened in September 1932 , its first and only act was to pass a massive vote of no-confidence in Papenâ s government .

On the far right , Duke was pressed hard by columns of attacking Union soldiers .
The next day , Stoneman and his cavalry went into camp at Glade Spring , Virginia , which was approximately 13 m west of Marion .
Breckinridge &apos; s forces consisted of Colonel Henry Giltner &apos; s brigade -- formed from the soldiers of the 4th Kentucky Cavalry and the 10th Kentucky Cavalry Battalions -- the 11th Kentucky Mounted Rifles -- later renamed the 13th Kentucky Cavalry Battalion -- and the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantry .
Stoneman ordered Burbridge to bring his division of 4,200 cavalrymen through the Cumberland Gap to join Stoneman and Gillem at Knoxville , Tennessee , where Gillem was refitting his own command into a picked force of 1,500 men .
By about 4 a.m. , they reached the main road near Seven Mile Ford , Virginia where Breckinridge halted to wait for daylight before continuing .
On December 14 , the Union regiments began to push Duke &apos; s cavalry back toward Abingdon , Virginia .
This gained the approval of Maj. Gen. John Schofield on December 6 , 1864 .
There Gillem captured 84 prisoners , including Col. Richard C. Morgan and the brigade &apos; s supply train .
Breckinridge &apos; s front regiment was the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles , under the command of Col. Benjamin Caudill .
Breckinridge sent Witcher and his men of the 34th on ahead of the main force and ordered them to harass the Union forces .
The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks , yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so .
On December 12 , Stoneman &apos; s force flanked and forced back Confederate Brig . Gen. Basil W. Duke &apos; s cavalry at Rogersville , Tennessee .
Although the vastly outnumbered Confederates had inflicted casualties and slowed the Union advance on Saltville , they were incapable of halting it .
The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry .
They then continued to retreat toward Marion .
Union forces defeated and scattered Confederate troops the next day at Kingsport , Tennessee .
At about 3 a.m. , Breckinridge and his small company began to cross Walkers Mountain .
Saltville fell to a night attack on December 20 -- 21 and the salt works were destroyed by the Union forces .
Before Giltner &apos; s reinforcements arrived , Duke and his men counterattacked the Union line -- routing it and forcing a withdrawal .
The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works .
The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops to a point that he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines .
On the night of December 18 , Breckinridge and his troops moved out of Saltville , Virginia , in an effort to stem Stoneman &apos; s advance .
Stoneman did not reveal the objectives of the expedition to his subordinates until three days after they had departed Knoxville on December 10 .
Alvan Gillem and Stephen Burbridge , including the 5th and the 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry Regiments -- both of which had participated in the previous attempt to destroy the salt works during the First Battle of Saltville .
Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Union &apos; s extreme left flank , inflicting significant damage on a Union colored regiment .
Caudill &apos; s men dismounted and fired into the Union cavalry , inflicting minor casualties .
Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling ; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece .
The rest of Giltner &apos; s Brigade also joined in the charge , routing the Union soldiers and allowing the Confederate forces to use the defensive positions themselves .
With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman &apos; s troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon , there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future .
On December 16 , Stoneman &apos; s cavalry advanced towards Marion , destroying infrastructure and public buildings in their path .
Taking the regular troops with him , Breckinridge left Col. Robert Preston in charge of the 500 militia men to defend the salt works .
The Battle of Marion -LRB- December 17 -- 18 , 1864 -RRB- was a military engagement fought between units of the Union Army and the Confederate Army during the American Civil War near the town of Marion , Virginia .
Around noon of December 17 , 1864 , Breckinridge &apos; s men mounted their horses and rode towards Marion .
As the rest of Breckinridge &apos; s troops began to arrive on the scene , Stoneman &apos; s soldiers secured elevated positions overlooking the river .
Breckinridge ordered his field officers to inspect the troops and to report back with the condition of his troops .
Burbridge &apos; s front regiment easily pushed back Witcher &apos; s small regiment , who stopped just so they could fire a volley into the Union cavalry .
Finding their own path to Saltville &apos; s defenses blocked , Breckinridge and his men retreated further south , while a Union company advanced .
Stoneman also sent two regiments of cavalry to destroy the lead mines and smelting facilities that were located about 10 m from Wytheville .
Stoneman and Burbridge continued on toward Marion where they encountered Witcher and his men .
Witcher sent a courier to inform Breckinridge that they were coming to join them at Marion .
It also included Basil Duke &apos; s cavalry , Brig . Gen. George Cosby &apos; s cavalry , and Col. Vincent Witcher &apos; s 34th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry .
Meanwhile , Stoneman sent some of his Tennessee regiments to Wytheville to destroy anything that looked valuable .
Seeing this , Col. Giltner sent his regiment to reinforce Duke .
In the last few days before the march , 4 i of rain had fallen , leaving the roads muddy and travel difficult .

It is now thought that the first passerines evolved in Gondwana at some time in the Paleogene , maybe around the Late Paleocene some 60 â `` 55 mya .
However , the early fossil record is poor because the first Passeriformes were apparently on the small side of the present size range , and their delicate bones did not preserve well .
QM specimens F20688 -LRB- carpometacarpus -RRB- and F24685 -LRB- tibiotarsus -RRB- from Murgon , Queensland are fossil bone fragments clearly recognizable as passeriform ; they represent two species of approximately 10 and 20 cm in overall length and prove that some 55 mya , barely into the Early Eocene , early perching birds were recognizably distinct .

Its relative major is D-flat major , and its parallel major is B-flat major .
The old valveless horn was barely capable of playing in B-flat minor ; the only example found in 18th century music is a modulation that occurs in the first minuet of Franz Krommer &apos; s Concertino in D major , Opus 80 .
Some important oboe solos in this key in the orchestral literature include the second movement of Tchaikovsky &apos; s Symphony No. 4 , which depicts `` the feeling that you get when you are all alone &apos; &apos; , in Tchaikovsky &apos; s words . Tchaikovsky &apos; s Piano Concerto No. 1 is also in B-flat minor .
B-flat minor is traditionally a ` dark &apos; key . &apos; &apos;

The song has since been regarded as the centerpiece track on the album .
Not long after , despite not taking the song seriously , Martin &apos; s idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse .
They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste .
The song was well-received from critics .
A Billboard magazine review said , `` After one single -LRB- ` Yellow &apos; -RRB- and its accompanying album -LRB- Parachutes ... -RRB- , Coldplay have already been anointed heir to the Brit-rock throne . &apos; &apos;
The single includes the songs `` Help Is Round the Corner &apos; &apos; and `` No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground &apos; &apos; , the third taken from the band &apos; s first EP , Safety .
Billboard said that `` every time that electric-guitar riff barges in , you &apos; re hooked all over again . &apos; &apos;
To improve the song , they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar .
While composing the song &apos; s lyrics , however , Martin could not find the right words .
The reaction was chiefly positive and even the newly-revitalized BBC Radio 2 played the track repeatedly .
The melody `` started off a lot slower &apos; &apos; , according to drummer Will Champion , and it sounded like a Neil Young song .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; is a song by English alternative rock band Coldplay .
It has also became a sing-along number at various British clubs , pubs and sporting events ; the song is consistently played during home games at English Championship club Watford .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; won Best Single at the 2001 NME Carling Awards .
The drawing of a line refers to Martin &apos; s habit of writing lists , and underlining those important things on the list .
The song opens with an acoustic guitar part , backed by a mimicking electric guitar , then forwards to the lead guitar line .
It was pressed to 1,000 copies , and was issued only to fans and journalists .
Despite its lyrical theme , however , most people have considered `` Yellow &apos; &apos; as a happy song .
The band released a limited-edition CD of `` Trouble &apos; &apos; , the third single off Parachutes , which features a remix of `` Yellow &apos; &apos; .
The former was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000 .
According to Champion , &apos; &apos; ... it was really difficult to record , because it worked at about five or six different tempos .
The song &apos; s lyrics are a reference to band vocalist Chris Martin &apos; s unrequited love , and its musicscape is built on a varied instrumentation .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; features Martin &apos; s falsetto , and nearly spoken-word whispers .
In the United States , however , the song was released as the lead single off the album .
This heavy rotation continued for months after its release , eventually ending as 2000 &apos; s most-aired song .
The band and Nelson produced the track .
In the US , after it was being used in promos of ABC , the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001 .
According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplay &apos; s second album , A Rush of Blood to the Head , for Spin magazine , the band is still known in the United States for their `` surprise smash ` Yellow &apos; &apos; &apos; .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; was written in a Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle , where Coldplay began working on their debut album , Parachutes .
The song was also used as the theme music for The Cancer Council Australia &apos; s `` Daffodil Day &apos; &apos; , in recognition of that organization &apos; s official flower &apos; s yellow hue .
It was nominated at the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal .
Nelson used an analog 2-inch type tape in recording most of the tracks in the album .
Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone magazine has noted `` Yellow &apos; &apos; is `` unrepentantly romantic &apos; &apos; , adding that `` the band creates a hypnotic slo-mo otherworld where spirit rules supreme &apos; &apos; .
It then goes back to the acoustic section .
The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle .
Outside , there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and `` just amazing &apos; &apos; , according to the song &apos; s co-producer , Ken Nelson .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; was initially recorded upstairs in the project studio , basically a demo room in Liverpool &apos; s Parr Street Studios .
At first , Martin did not take it seriously `` as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice &apos; &apos; .
Martin has explained of the song : &apos; &apos; ` Yellow &apos; refers to the mood of the band .
A month after the album was released in the United States via record label Nettwerk , `` Yellow &apos; &apos; was used as the theme song for ABC autumn television promotions .
Nelson was acquainted with the band &apos; s music through the former &apos; s manager .
One night after finishing recording `` Shiver &apos; &apos; , the lead single of the album , the band took a break and went out of the studio .
Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line `` Look at the stars &apos; &apos; .
He was thinking of a specific word , which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics , to fit the song &apos; s concept .
That night , having quickly composed the song , the band recorded it .
It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play , because sometimes it sounded too rushed , and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging ... &apos; &apos; The band was trying to get the right tempo , according to Nelson , `` because a beat either side of the tempo we picked did n &apos;t have the same groove &apos; &apos; .
When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas , they had created the riff , `` and it sort of got a bit heavier &apos; &apos; .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; and `` Shiver &apos; &apos; were initially released as EPs in the spring of 2000 .
So Nelson used Pro Tools `` to get the feel of -LRB- the track -RRB- just right &apos; &apos; ; once all takes were recorded into the computer , `` we then put it down to the 2-inch , which I found was a great way to do it &apos; &apos; , according to Nelson .
Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone magazine has deemed the song a career-making record .
Martin , after the song &apos; s mixing , felt that his voice was `` too subdued , too quiet &apos; &apos; .
He looked around the studio and found the telephone directory Yellow Pages , which happened to be situated nearest to him .
The references in some of the song &apos; s lyrics , including the swimming and drawing a line , `` are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion &apos; &apos; .
Nelson and the band encountered problems in producing some aspects of the song .
Helped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions , the song thrust the band into massive popularity .
Roach has claimed in his book , Coldplay : Nobody Said It Was Easy , that although `` Shiver &apos; &apos; earned the band their debut UK Top 40 single , it was `` Yellow &apos; &apos; that has changed `` everything &apos; &apos; , and that it `` exemplifies so much of what had made Coldplay so popular &apos; &apos; .
Martin has said , `` The song had the word ` stars &apos; and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice . &apos; &apos;
Nelson &apos; s manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay , and showed interest in working with them after seeing the band perform live .
As recording progressed , `` Yellow &apos; &apos; was one of a couple of songs that they `` could n &apos;t quite get on analog &apos; &apos; .
They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output .
The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating .
The song was released in June 2000 as the second single off Parachutes , following `` Shiver &apos; &apos; , and the lead single in the United States .
Brightness and hope and devotion . &apos; &apos;
The single reached number four in the UK Singles Chart , giving the band their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom .
`` Yellow &apos; &apos; has since been covered by various recording artists worldwide , and remains one of the band &apos; s most popular songs .
In October 2000 , the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets .
Martin has commented that the song is about devotion , referring to his unrequited love -LRB- Martin was single at the time he wrote the song -RRB- .
He quipped , `` In an alternate universe , this song could be called ` Playboy . &apos; &apos;&apos;
The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson for their debut album , Parachutes -LRB- 2000 -RRB- .
Its instrumentation is varied , including the drums , cymbals , and the occasional hi-hat and ascending bass guitar .
The single , accompanied by its TV reception through its music video , received massive radio airplay , particularly at BBC Radio 1 .
He told the band to look at the stars , which they did .
Martin later titled the song `` Yellow &apos; &apos; as a reference to the directory .
Vocalist Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song &apos; s main melody , consisting of a chord pattern , popped into his head .

Because the material is very small , it becomes suspended in river water making the water appear cloudy , which is sometimes known as glacial milk .
Rock flour , or glacial flour , consists of fine-grained , silt-sized particles of rock , generated by mechanical grinding of bedrock by glacial erosion or by artificial grinding to a similar size .
His ideas were not taken up due to technical limitations and , according to proponents of his method , because of opposition from the champions of conventional fertilisers .
If the river flows into a glacial lake , the lake may appear turquoise in color as a result .
An early experimenter was the German miller , Julius Hensel , author of Bread from Stones , who reported successful results with steinmehl -LRB- stonemeal -RRB- in the 1890s .

It was a lethal biological with an anticipated fatality rate of 40 to 60 percent .
UL was streptomycin resistant .
Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall .
The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern , being sensitive to sun light , and losing virulence over time after release .
Over the following summers , Martha &apos; s Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing .

In the US , practical research into using rabbit fever as a bioweapon took place in 1954 at Pine Bluff Arsenal , Arkansas , an extension of the Camp Detrick program .
In 2004 , three researchers at Boston University Medical Center were accidentally infected with F. tularensis , after apparently failing to follow safety procedures .
Tularemia -LRB- also known as Pahvant Valley plague , rabbit fever , deer fly fever , Ohara &apos; s fever -RRB- is a serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis .
An outbreak of tularemia occurred in Kosovo in 1999-2000 .
It was viewed as an attractive agent because :
No vaccine is available to the general public .
A former Soviet biological weapons scientist , Kenneth Alibek , has alleged that an outbreak of Tularemia among German soldiers shortly before the siege of Stalingrad was due to the release of F. tularensis by Soviet forces , but this claim is rejected by others who have studied the outbreak .
In 2005 , small amounts of F. tularensis were detected in the Mall area of Washington , DC the morning after an anti-war demonstration on September 24 , 2005 .
The best way to prevent tularemia infection is to wear rubber gloves when handling or skinning lagomorphs -LRB- such as rabbits -RRB- , avoid ingesting uncooked wild game and untreated water sources , wear long-sleeved clothes , and use an insect repellent to prevent tick bites .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regard F. tularensis as a viable bioweapons agent , and it has been included in the biological warfare programs of the USA , USSR and Japan at various times .
When the 425 strain was standardized as agent JT -LRB- an incapacitant rather than lethal agent -RRB- , the Schu S4 strain &apos; s symbol was changed again to SR .
In the summer of 2000 , an outbreak of tularemia in Martha &apos; s Vineyard resulted in one fatality , and brought the interest of the CDC as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized Francisella tularensis .
The Schu S4 strain was standardized as Agent UL for use in the U.S. M143 bursting spherical bomblet .
In July 2007 , an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of Castile and LeÃ n and traced to the plague of voles infesting the region .

These are known as small morph adults .
These large larvae are usually known as waterdogs , and are used extensively in the fishing bait and pet trade .
One of the largest threats to Tiger Salamander populations is wetland -LRB- habitat -RRB- destruction and \ / or alteration .
Adults are rarely seen in the open and often live in burrows that are usually 2 feet from the surface .
Large-scale captive breeding of Tiger salamanders has not been accomplished , for unknown reasons .
Some larvae , especially in seasonal pools and in the north , may metamorphose as soon as feasible .
Genetic studies made it necessary to break up the original A. tigrinum population , even though there is some hybridization between groups .
The California Tiger Salamander -LRB- Ambystoma californiense -RRB- , the Barred Tiger Salamander -LRB- Ambystoma mavortium -RRB- , and the Plateau Tiger Salamander -LRB- Ambystoma velasci -RRB- , were all once subspecies of A. tigrinum , but are now considered separate species .
While remaining locally common in many regions , Tiger Salamander numbers have declined compared with historical levels .
Tiger salamanders are almost entirely terrestrial as adults , and usually only return to the water to breed .
Nearly all such salamanders are wild-caught .
The effect of agricultural pesticides in endocrine disruption has also been researched .
Other larvae , especially in ancestral pools and warmer climates , may not metamorphose until fully adult size .
The Axolotl is also a relative of the Tiger Salamander .
These are the neotenes , and are particularly common where terrestrial conditions are bad .
Since they tend to breed in semipermanent wetlands , larval Tiger Salamanders often experience mass mortality in association with pond drying .
The larvae are entirely aquatic , and are characterized by large external gills and a prominent caudal fin that originates just behind the head .
However , Tiger Salamanders are only listed as endangered in Delaware , New York , New Jersey and Maryland ; protected in Arizona ; and of special concern in both North and South Carolina .
They also like to swim , even if they are terrestrial .
Axolotls live in a neotenous state , retaining most characteristics of their larval stage for their entire lifespan .
They also are good swimmers .
The proper common name is the Eastern Tiger Salamander , to differentiate from other closely related species .
While they never metamorphose under natural conditions , metamorphosis can be induced in them , resulting in a form very similar to the Mexican Tiger Salamander .
-LRB- http : / / www.amphibiaweb.org -RRB- In November 2001 , the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Great Lakes population of the Tiger Salamander as being extirpated , and the Southern Mountain population in British Columbia &apos; s Okanagan as endangered in Canada .
The Tiger Salamander -LRB- Ambystoma tigrinum -RRB- is a species of Mole Salamander .
However , a single tiger salamander has only a 50 % chance of breeding more than once in its lifetime .
Males nudge a willing female to initiate mating , and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom .
Introduced fishes have also been known to reduce , and levels they also experience reduced growth and longer larval periods .
Tiger salamander adults are also often sold as pets , or used in research .
Like all ambystomatids , they are extremely loyal to their birthplace , and will travel long distances to reach it .
This is not , however , their natural condition , and dramatically shortens their lifespan .
Some populations may not metamorphose at all , and become sexually mature while in their larval form .
The female picks up the packet and deposits the now-fertilized eggs on vegetation .
All of these issues have collectively influenced Tiger Salamander populations .
But also they partly live in both land and water .

Its key signature has five sharps .
For orchestration of piano music , some theorists recommend transposing the music to G minor or A minor .

These bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of around 120,000 people and more over time , because of the nuclear radiation .
The driving reaction may be nuclear fission , nuclear fusion or a multistage cascading combination of the two , though to date all fusion based weapons have used a fission device to initiate fusion , and a pure fusion weapon remains a hypothetical device .
The second event occurred three days later when , again , the United States dropped a plutonium implosion-type device code-named `` Fat Man &apos; &apos; on the city of Nagasaki .

That the excommunication of Henry IV was simply a pretext for the opposition of the rebellious German nobles is transparent .

The Taung Child is believed to have been about 3 years old at the time of its death .
Examinations of the Taung Child fossil compared to that of an equivalent 9-year-old child suggest that A. africanus had a growth rate to adolescence more similar to that of modern apes like chimpanzees -LRB- genus Pan -RRB- than to that of modern Homo sapiens .
It was discovered in 1924 by quarrymen working for the Northern Lime Company in Taung , South Africa .
It was a creature standing 3 &apos; 6 &apos; &apos; -LRB- 105 cm -RRB- and weighing about 20 â `` 24 pounds -LRB- 9 â `` 11 kg -RRB- .
The Taung Child â &apos; &apos; or Taung Baby â &apos; &apos; is the fossilized skull of a young Australopithecus africanus individual .
Raymond Dart -LRB- 1893 â `` 1988 -RRB- , an anatomist at the University of Witwatersrand , received the fossil , recognized its importance and published his discovery in the journal Nature in 1925 , describing it as a new species .
However , intermediate species such as Homo ergaster \ / Homo erectus are thought to have gone through growth rates intermediate between modern humans and apes .
This conclusion was reached by noting similarities in the damage to the skull and eye sockets of the Taung Child with damage to the skulls of modern primates known to have been killed by eagles .
The British scientific establishment was at the time enamored with the hoax Piltdown Man , which had a large brain and ape-like teeth â `` the exact opposite of the Taung Child â `` and Dart &apos; s interpretation was not appreciated for decades .
The fossil consists of most of the face and mandible with teeth and , uniquely , a natural endocast of the braincase .
In early 2006 it was announced that the Taung Child was probably killed by an eagle or similar large predatory bird .
It had a cranial capacity of 340 cc and lived mainly in a savanna habitat .
This conclusion has mostly been based on the Turkana Boy fossil discovered in 1984 .

In many states there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court .
The body of precedent is called `` common law &apos; &apos; and it binds future decisions .
Additionally , even before the separate courts were merged together , most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity , though under potentially different procedural law . Nonetheless , the historical distinction between `` law &apos; &apos; and `` equity &apos; &apos; remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following :
The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred , with the growing importance of jurisprudence -LRB- almost like case law but in name -RRB- in civil law countries , and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries .

Most of the gastropods of the Palaeozoic era belong to primitive groups , a few of which still survive today .
By the Carboniferous period many of the shapes we see in living gastropods can be matched in the fossil record , but despite these similarities in appearance the majority of these older forms are not directly related to living forms .
In rocks of the Mesozoic era , gastropods are slightly more common as fossils , their shells are often well preserved .
Rocks of the Cenozoic era yield very large numbers of gastropod fossils , many of these fossils being closely related to modern living forms .
The taxonomy of the Gastropoda as shown in various texts can differ in major ways , and on-going revisions of the higher taxonomic levels are to be expected in the near future .
The first gastropods were exclusively marine , with the earliest representatives of the group appearing in the Late Cambrian -LRB- Chippewaella , Strepsodiscus -RRB- .
It was during the Mesozoic era that the ancestors of many of the living gastropods evolved .
The `` Purbeck Marble &apos; &apos; of the Jurassic period and the `` Sussex Marble &apos; &apos; of the early Cretaceous period , which both occur in southern England , are limestones containing the tightly packed remains of the pond snail Viviparus .
By the Ordovician period the gastropods were a varied group present in a range of aquatic habitats .
In one large group of sea slugs , the gills are arranged as a rosette of feathery plumes on their backs , which gives rise to their other name , nudibranchs .
This coiled shell usually opens on the right-hand side -LRB- as viewed with the shell apex pointing upward -RRB- .
Some nudibranchs have smooth or warty backs and have no visible gill mechanism , such that respiration may likely take place directly through the skin .
The diversity of the gastropods increased markedly at the beginning of this era , along with that of the bivalves .
Their fossils occur in ancient beds deposited in both freshwater and marine environments .
Commonly , fossil gastropods from the rocks of the early Palaeozoic era are too poorly preserved for accurate identification .
Fossil gastropods were less common during the Palaeozoic era than bivalves .
Still , the Silurian genus Poleumita contains fiftean identified species .
Numerous species have an operculum , which in many species acts as a trapdoor to close the shell .
In the land slugs , the shell is reduced or absent , and the body is streamlined .
One of the earliest known terrestrial -LRB- land-dwelling -RRB- gastropods is Maturipupa , which is found in the Coal Measures of the Carboniferous period in Europe , but relatives of the modern land snails are rare before the Cretaceous period , when the familiar Helix first appeared .
Gastropods are one of the groups that record the changes in fauna caused by the advance and retreat of the Ice Sheets during the Pleistocene epoch .
The taxonomy of the Gastropoda is under constant revision , and more and more of the old taxonomy is being abandoned as the results of DNA studies slowly become clearer .

For example , in the multiset the multiplicities of the members a , b , and c are respectively 2 , 3 , and 1 , and the cardinality of the multiset is 6 .
In mathematics , a multiset -LRB- or bag -RRB- is a generalization of a set .
A quadratic equation , for example , has two solutions .
A related example is the multiset of solutions of an algebraic equation .
The number of times an element belongs to the multiset is the multiplicity of that member .
The total number of elements in a multiset , including repeated memberships , is the cardinality of the multiset .
which gives the multiset .
Thus the multiset of solutions of the equation could be , or it could be .
In the latter case it has a solution of multiplicity 2 .
However , in some cases they are both the same number .
One of the simplest and most natural examples is the multiset of prime factors of a number n . Here the underlying set of elements is the set of prime divisors of n . For example the number 120 has the prime factorization

More than a thousand of them represented species new to science .
It was praised by scientists such as Darwin -LRB- to whom the book was dedicated -RRB- , and Charles Lyell , and by non-scientists such as the novelist Joseph Conrad , who called it his `` favorite bedside companion &apos; &apos; and used it as source of information for several of his novels , especially Lord Jim .
He also believed that the raison d &apos; Ã tre of the universe was the development of the human spirit .
Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism , notably William Crookes , were subject to much criticism from the press , with The Lancet as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh .
Alfred Russel Wallace , OM , FRS -LRB- 8 January 1823 â `` 7 November 1913 -RRB- was a British naturalist , explorer , geographer , anthropologist and biologist .
Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as The Malay Archipelago .
The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals .
He was also profoundly influenced by Robert Chambers &apos; work Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation , a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system , the earth , and living things .
It strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as Henry Bates , Thomas Huxley , and even Darwin , who felt he was overly credulous .
And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in mankind .
From 1854 to 1862 , age 31 to 39 , Wallace traveled through the Malay Archipelago or East Indies -LRB- now Malaysia and Indonesia -RRB- , to collect specimens for sale and to study nature .
He could only save part of his diary and a few sketches .
At about the same time , he began to maintain that natural selection can not account for mathematical , artistic , or musical genius , as well as metaphysical musings , and wit and humor .
On 12 July 1852 , Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig Helen .
All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship , the vast majority of what he had collected during his entire trip , were lost .
Wallace collected more than 125,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago -LRB- more than 80,000 beetles alone -RRB- .
Wallace continued charting the Rio Negro for four years , collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography , flora , and fauna .
After 28 days at sea , the ship &apos; s cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship .
He eventually said that something in `` the unseen universe of Spirit &apos; &apos; had interceded at least three times in history .
Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig Jordeson , which was sailing from Cuba to London .
He is best known for independently proposing a theory of evolution due to natural selection that prompted Charles Darwin to publish his own theory .
Wallace &apos; s very public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defense of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the 1870s damaged his scientific reputation .
The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter .
Others , such as the physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter and zoologist E. Ray Lankester became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue .

As such , fire and disease outbreaks are constant concerns .
For sanitary reasons , military tent cities place toilet , shower , and laundry facilities at least 50 f from living quarters .
Depending on the branch of service and the length of time the tent city has been in place , the living space may be equipped with most modern amenities .
Tent cities set up by homeless people may be similar to shanty towns , which are informal settlements in which the buildings are made from scrap building materials .
Since the late 1990s , Saudi authorities have started using fireproof tents to reduce the risks of a major fire .
In early January 2007 , city officials noted city codes that prohibit living in tents and gave the society one week to evict the occupants of the tent city .
As well , state governments or military organizations set up tent cities to house refugees , evacuees , or soldiers .
Displaced residents are only expected to stay for three to six months .

Umbriel , along with another Uranian satellite , Ariel , was discovered by William Lassell on October 24 , 1851 .
Umbriel is a moon of Uranus discovered on October 24 , 1851 , by William Lassell .
So far the only close-up images of Umbriel have been from the Voyager 2 probe , which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986 .
The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 at the request of Lassell .
At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of Umbriel -LRB- like those of the other moons -RRB- was pointed towards the Sun , so the northern -LRB- dark -RRB- hemisphere could not be studied .
Umbriel is the ` dusky melancholy sprite &apos; in Alexander Pope &apos; s The Rape of the Lock , and the name suggests the Latin umbra , meaning shadow .

In fact , Li Bai was part of the group of Chinese scholars during his time in Chang ` an , called the `` Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup &apos; &apos; , as mentioned in a poem by fellow poet Du Fu -RRB- .
A pot of wine , under the flowering trees ; I drink alone , for no friend is near .
Further translations into French were accomplished by Marquis d &apos;Hervey de Saint-Denys in his 1862 PoÃ sies de l &apos; Ã poque des Thang .
Raising my cup I beckon the bright moon , For her , with my shadow , will make three people .
Yet with the moon as friend and the shadow as slave I must make merry before the Spring is spent .
While we were sober , three shared the fun ; Now we are drunk , each goes their way .
The moon , alas , is no drinker of wine ; Listless , my shadow creeps about at my side .
Li Bai is influential in the West partly due to Ezra Pound &apos; s versions of some of his poems in the collection ` Cathay &apos; .
To the songs I sing the moon flickers her beams ; In the dance I weave my shadow tangles and breaks .
A dozen of Du Fu &apos; s poems to or about Li Bai survive , while only one from Li Bai to Du Fu remains .
It is the main reason for milk &apos; s extended shelf life . High Temperature Short Time -LRB- HTST -RRB- pasteurised milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks , whereas ultra pasteurised milk can last much longer , sometimes two to three months .
These agencies require milk to be HTST pasteurized in order to qualify for the `` pasteurization &apos; &apos; label .
Pasteurization methods are usually standardized and controlled by national food safety agencies -LRB- such as the USDA in the United States and the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom -RRB- .
Instead pasteurization aims to reduce the number of viable pathogens so they are unlikely to cause disease -LRB- assuming the pasteurized product is stored as indicated and consumed before its expiration date -RRB- .
There are different standards for different dairy products , depending on the fat content and the intended usage .
For example , the pasteurization standards for cream differ from the standards for fluid milk , and the standards for pasteurizing cheese are designed to preserve the phosphatase enzyme , which aids in cutting .
Researchers have developed more sensitive diagnostics , such as real-time PCR and improved culture methods that have enabled them to identify pathogens in pasteurised milk .
Milk pasteurization has been subject to increasing scrutiny in recent years , due to the discovery of pathogens that are both widespread and heat resistant -LRB- able to survive pasteurization in significant numbers -RRB- .
Unlike sterilization , pasteurization is not intended to kill all micro-organisms in the food .
Commercial-scale sterilization of food is not common because it adversely affects the taste and quality of the product .
Milk simply labeled `` pasteurised &apos; &apos; is usually treated with the HTST method , whereas milk labeled `` ultra-pasteurised &apos; &apos; or simply `` UHT &apos; &apos; has been treated with the UHT method .
There are two main types of pasteurization used today : High Temperature \ / Short Time -LRB- HTST -RRB- and `` Extended Shelf Life -LRB- ESL -RRB- &apos; &apos; treatment . Ultra-high temperature -LRB- UHT or ultra-heat treated -RRB- is also used for milk treatment .

Most bisexual porn is made by small production companies rather than the major studios .
A common way that these are depicted in a single scene is with one woman and two men performing together .
Content featuring male bisexuality has been a growing trend since the advent of internet pornography .

It is named after Calliope , the Greek Muse of epic poetry .
Kalliope has one known natural satellite , Linus , or -LRB- 22 -RRB- Kalliope I Linus .
Kalliope &apos; s rotation is then slightly retrograde .
It is quite large , being about 28 km in diameter , and would be a sizeable asteroid by itself .
Kalliope also has a low radar albedo , which is inconsistent with a purely metallic surface .
Lightcurve analysis indicates that Kalliope &apos; s pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates -LRB- Î , Î &apos; &apos; -RRB- = -LRB- â &apos; 23 Â , 20 Â -RRB- with a 10 Â uncertainty , which gives Kalliope an axial tilt of 103 Â .
Kalliope is somewhat elongated , approximately 166 km in diameter , and slightly asymmetric , as evidenced by resolved images taken with the VLT at the European Southern Observatory .
Linus was discovered on August 29 , 2001 by Jean-Luc Margot and Michael E. Brown , while another team led by William Merline also independently detected the moon 3 days later .
22 Kalliope is a large main belt M-type asteroid discovered by J. R. Hind on November 16 , 1852 .
It orbits about 1100 km from the center of Kalliope , equivalent to about 13.2 Kalliope radii .
Spectroscopic studies have shown , however , evidence of hydrated minerals and silicates , which indicate rather a stony surface composition .

Water wheels in China found practical uses such as this , as well as extraordinary use .
Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi , a passage of his writing gives hint that the water wheel was in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China -LRB- Wade-Giles spelling -RRB- :
Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears ; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load .

Other times the secret would be about something they were there to do .
The panel was introduced at the start of each episode by the host , usually with a series of descriptive puns .
The show was originally hosted by radio and television personality Garry Moore .
After several months of an ever-changing panel , the show settled down to include game show host Bill Cullen , acerbic comedian Henry Morgan , TV hostess Faye Emerson , and actress Jayne Meadows .
Following the revelation of a guest &apos; s secret , either by guessing or by the host &apos; s revelation once the game was over , the host typically either interviewed the contestant about their secret , or , if applicable , the contestant did some kind of demonstration of their secret .

It quoted a familiar melody widely associated with schoolyard taunts , to which the words `` I &apos; ve got a secret ! &apos; &apos;
Increasingly later in the run , the panelists were sometimes buzzed out when they were getting too close to the secret , were suspected to be about to get it , or simply at a point that would get a laugh ; this was precipitated in part by the fact that , like What &apos; s My Line , the top payoff never increased with inflation , and the money eventually became somewhat secondary to the gameplay , with the cash awards not even mentioned at all by the end of the series .
It was hosted by newsreader Don Secombe , and like its American inspiration , featured regular celebrity panelists including Ron Cadee , Babette Stevens and Joy Chambers -LRB- future wife of Australian game show impresario Reg Grundy -RRB- .

In more accurate terms , it is the intersection of the celestial sphere with the ecliptic plane , which is the geometric plane containing the mean orbit of the Earth around the Sun .
The present ecliptic plane is inclined to the invariable plane by about 1.5 Â . -RRB-
-LRB- The ecliptic plane should be distinguished from the invariable plane of the solar system , which is perpendicular to the vector sum of the angular momenta of all planetary orbital planes , to which Jupiter is the main contributor .
As the rotational axis of the Earth is not perpendicular to its orbital plane , the equatorial plane is not parallel to the ecliptic plane , but makes an angle of about 23 Â 26 &apos; , which is known as the axial tilt -LRB- or obliquity of the ecliptic -RRB- .
The ecliptic is the apparent path that the Sun traces out in the sky during the year , appearing to move eastwards on an imaginary spherical surface , the celestial sphere , relative to the -LRB- almost -RRB- fixed stars .
The name ecliptic arises because eclipses occur when the full or new Moon is very close to this path of the Sun .

It is possible to have more than one kind of supersymmetry transformation .
In four dimensions , a spinor has four degrees of freedom and thus the minimal number of supersymmetry generators is four in four dimensions and having eight copies of supersymmetry means that there are 32 supersymmetry generators .
Another advantage of supersymmetry is that supersymmetric quantum field theory can sometimes be solved . Supersymmetry is also a feature of most versions of string theory , though it can exist in nature even if string theory is incorrect .

The salts pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate are found in many over-the-counter preparations either as a single ingredient or , more commonly , in combination with antihistamines , guaifenesin , dextromethorphan , paracetamol -LRB- acetaminophen -RRB- , and \ / or NSAIDs -LRB- e.g. , aspirin , ibuprofen , etc . -RRB- .
Ducy-Sainte-Marguerite is a commune in the Calvados department in the Basse-Normandie region in northwestern France .
Although excavations by German archaeologist Robert Koldewey are thought to reveal its foundations , many historians disagree about the location , and some believe it may have been confused with gardens in Nineveh .
The soldiers marched under the walls through the lowered water .
Whether the gardens did exist is a matter of dispute .
Under Nabopolassar , Babylon threw off the Assyrian rule in 612 BC and became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian Chaldean Empire .
The famed walls of Babylon were indeed impenetrable , with the only way into the city through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates , which ebbed beneath its thick walls .
All that was ever found of the Original Ishtar gate was the foundation and scattered bricks .
The early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk , but by the reign of Darius III , over-taxation and the strains of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon &apos; s main shrines and canals , and the disintegration of the surrounding region .
In Achaemenid Persia , the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalised and flourished , and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations .
In 539 BC , the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great , king of Persia , with an unprecedented military engagement known as the Battle of Opis .
Claiming to be the successor of the ancient Eridu , Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the `` holy city &apos; &apos; of Mesopotamia around the time Hammurabi first unified the Babylonian Empire , and again became the seat of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 612 to 539 BC .
Cyrus -LRB- or his generals -RRB- devised a plan to use the Euphrates as the mode of entry to the city , ordering large camps of troops at each point and instructed them to wait for the signal .
Awaiting an evening of a national feast among Babylonians -LRB- generally thought to refer to the feast of Belshazzar mentioned in Daniel V -RRB- , Cyrus &apos; troops diverted the Euphrates river upstream , causing the Euphrates to drop to about ` mid thigh level on a man &apos; or to dry up altogether .
Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius the Great , Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy -LRB- Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north -RRB- , as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement .
The city was the administrative capital of the Persian Empire , the preeminent power of the then known world , and it played a vital part in the history of that region for over two centuries .
In 689 BC , its walls , temples and palaces were razed , and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu , the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south .
Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era .
The town flourished and attained prominence and political repute with the rise of the First Babylonian Dynasty .
With the recovery of Babylonian independence , a new era of architectural activity ensued , and his son Nebuchadnezzar II -LRB- 604 â `` 561 BC -RRB- made Babylon into one of the wonders of the ancient world .
Î &apos; &apos; Ï Î 1 \ / 2 , BabylÅ n -RRB- was an Akkadian city-state of ancient Mesopotamia , the remains of which are found in present-day Al Hillah , Babil Province , Iraq , about 85 kilometers -LRB- 55 mi -RRB- south of Baghdad .
Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds , including rebuilding the Etemenanki ziggurat and the construction of the Ishtar Gate â &apos; &apos; the most spectacular of eight gates that ringed the perimeter of Babylon .
Available historical resources suggest that Babylon was at first a small town which had sprung up by the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC .
Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people , including the Jews , to return to their own land -LRB- as explained in the Old Testament -RRB- , to allow their temple to be rebuilt back in Jerusalem .
Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon -LRB- one of the seven wonders of the ancient world -RRB- , said to have been built for his homesick wife Amyitis .
All that remains of the original ancient famed city of Babylon today is a mound , or tell , of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers .
This act shocked the religious conscience of Mesopotamia ; the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his sons was held to be in expiation of it , and his successor Esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city , to receive there his crown , and make it his residence during part of the year .
Despite three attempts at rebellion in 522 BC , 521 BC and 482 BC , the land and city of Babylon remained solidly under Persian rule for two centuries , until Alexander the Great &apos; s entry in 331 BC .
During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria , Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt , led by Mushezib-Marduk , and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon .

They have two sons -- Milo Arthur -LRB- born 1995 -RRB- and Theodore Apollo -LRB- born 1999 -RRB- -- and two daughters -- Lara Lettice -LRB- born 1993 -RRB- and Cassia Peaches -LRB- born 1997 -RRB- .

In September 2007 he was selected as the Conservative candidate for the 2008 Mayor of London election .
Johnson was dismissed from these high-profile posts in November , 2004 over accusations that he lied to Michael Howard about a four-year extramarital affair with Petronella Wyatt , The Spectators New York correspondent and former deputy editor .
Press releases said that the ban would apply to `` stations across the capital &apos; &apos; , but did not specify whether this included National Rail stations - especially those stations not served by the TfL lines on which alcohol is banned .
He was educated at the European School in Brussels , at Ashdown House School and at Eton College , where he was a King &apos; s Scholar .
In reference to his cosmopolitan ancestry , Johnson has described himself as a `` one-man melting pot &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; with a combination of Muslims , Jews and Christians comprising his great-grandparentage .

The Wheeler and Johnson families have known each other for decades , and Marina Wheeler was at the European School in Brussels at the same time as her future husband .
Johnson derided these allegations as `` an inverted pyramid of piffle &apos; &apos; , but Howard sacked Johnson because he believed press reports showed Johnson had lied , rather than for the affair itself .
On his father &apos; s side , Johnson is a great-grandson of Ali Kemal Bey , a liberal Turkish journalist and the interior minister in the government of Damat Ferid Pasha , Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire , who was murdered during the Turkish War of Independence .

The ban initially applied on the London Underground , Buses , DLR and Croydon Trams .
Subsequently , in a speech at the University of Exeter concerning student finance , he allegedly made comical remarks about his gratitude to the audience for not `` raising other issues &apos; &apos; during the talk , which may have been a reference to the allegations .
He read Classics at Balliol College , Oxford , as a Brackenbury scholar and was elected President of the Oxford Union at his second attempt .
During World War I , Boris &apos; s grandfather and great aunt were recognized as British subjects and took their grandmother &apos; s maiden name of Johnson .

Early research appeared to show that Nix was reddish like Pluto and unlike the other moons , but more recent reports have been that it is gray like the remaining satellites .
The moons were provisionally designated S \ / 2005 P 1 -LRB- Hydra -RRB- and S \ / 2005 P 2 -LRB- Nix -RRB- .
Nix is slightly fainter than Hydra , suggesting that it is somewhat smaller in size .

The known-plaintext attack -LRB- KPA -RRB- is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has samples of both the plaintext , a crib , and its encrypted version -LRB- ciphertext -RRB- . These can be used to reveal further secret information such as secret keys and code books .
Encrypted file archives such as ZIP are prone to this attack .
For example , an attacker with an encrypted ZIP file needs only one unencrypted file from the archive which forms the `` known-plaintext &apos; &apos; .
Classical ciphers are typically vulnerable to known-plaintext attack .
For example , a Caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely .
Then using some publicly available software they can quickly calculate the key required to decrypt the entire archive .

Despite the name &apos; s pejorative meaning , however , it contains a double meaningâ &apos; &apos; what is called tevriyye -LRB- Ø Ù Ø Ù Ù -RRB- in Ottoman Divan poetryâ &apos; &apos; as FuzÃ &apos; &apos; lÃ himself explains : `` I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary fuzÃ &apos; &apos; l -LRB- ï &apos; &apos; `` ï &apos; &apos; ï &apos; &apos; Ù -RRB- is given as a plural of fazl -LRB- ï &apos; &apos; `` ï &apos; &apos; ï &apos; &apos; ; ` learning &apos; -RRB- and has the same rhythm as â ulÃ &apos; &apos; m -LRB- ï &apos; &apos; ï &apos; &apos; ï &apos; &apos; Ù

Though his poetry flourished during his time among the Ottomans , the loss of his stipend meant that , materially speaking , FuzÃ &apos; &apos; lÃ never became secure .
Although his Turkish works are written in the Azeri dialect of Turkish , he was well-versed in both the Ottoman and the Chagatai Turkic literary traditions as well .
He was also well versed in mathematics and astronomy .
FuzÃ &apos; &apos; lÃ is generally believed to have been born around 1483 in what is now Iraq , when the area was under Ak Koyunlu Turkmen rule ; he was probably born in either KarbalÄ â or an-Najaf .
He died during a plague outbreak in 1556 , in KarbalÄ â , either of the plague itself or of cholera .
Though FuzÃ &apos; &apos; lÃ &apos; s ancestors had been of nomadic origin , the family had long since settled in towns .
Eventually , he decided upon the Arabic word fuzÃ &apos; &apos; lÃ â &apos; &apos; which literally means `` impertinent , improper , unnecessary &apos; &apos; â &apos; &apos; because he `` knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else &apos; &apos; .
Ù ; `` Complaint &apos; &apos; -RRB- , FuzÃ &apos; &apos; lÃ spoke out against such bureaucracy and its attendant corruption :
Often considered one of the greatest contributors to the DÃ vÃ cents n tradition of Azerbaijani literature -LRB- Turkish literature -RRB- , FuzÃ &apos; &apos; lÃ in fact wrote his collected poems -LRB- dÃ vÃ cents n -RRB- in three different languages : Azerbaijani Turkic , Persian , and Arabic .

Sinope -LRB- , or as in Greek Î # Î Î 1 \ / 2 Ï Ï Î -RRB- is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Lick Observatory in 1914 , and is named after Sinope of Greek mythology .
The most distant moon of Jupiter now known is .
However , given its mean inclination and different color , Sinope could be also an independent object , captured independently , unrelated to the collision and break-up at the origin of the group .
They are continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations .
The orbital elements are as of January 2000 .
Sinope did not receive its present name until 1975 ; before then , it was simply known as &apos; .
Its infrared spectrum is similar to D-type asteroids also different from Pasiphae .
Sinope orbits Jupiter on a high eccentricity and high inclination retrograde orbit .
It was sometimes called `` Hades &apos; &apos; between 1955 and 1975 .
These dissimilarities of the physical parameters suggest a different origin from the core members of the group .
It is often believed to belong to the PasiphaÃ `` group .
Sinope was the outermost known moon of Jupiter until the discovery of Megaclite in 2000 .
Sinope has an estimated diameter of 38 km -LRB- assuming an albedo of 0.04 -RRB- The satellite is red -LRB- color indices B-V = 0.84 , R-V = 0.46 -RRB- . unlike Pasiphae which is gray .

The seventh mode contains the intervals semitone , semitone , semitone , tone , semitone , semitone , semitone , semitone , tone , semitone - it has six transpositions , like the tritone , and five modes .
Any scale having the same number of modes as notes is not a mode of limited transposition .
C major consists of C , D , E , F , G , A , B , and the scale a semitone higher -LRB- D major -RRB- consists of D , E , F , G , A , B , C. When transposing a mode of limited transposition this is not the case . For example , the mode of limited transposition that Messiaen labeled `` Mode 1 &apos; &apos; , which is the whole tone scale , contains the notes C , D , E , F , G , A ; transposing this mode up a semitone produces C , D , F , G , A , B. Transposing this up another semitone produces D , E , F , G , A , C. Since transposing the mode up a whole tone produces the same set of notes , mode 1 has only 2 transpositions .
The sixth mode has the intervals tone , tone , semitone , semitone , tone , tone , semitone , semitone - it has six transpositions , like the tritone , and four modes .
There are two complementary ways to view the modes : considering their possible transpositions , and considering the different modes contained within them .
One of stratigraphy &apos; s basic concepts is codified in the Law of Superposition , which simply states that , in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence , the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence .
It is primarily used in the study of sedimentary and layered volcanic rocks .
Smith , known as the Father of English Geology , created the first geologic map of England , and first recognized the significance of strata or rock layering , and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata .
This timescale remained a relative scale until the development of radiometric dating , which gave it and the stratigraphy it was based on an absolute time framework , leading to the development of chronostratigraphy .
It provides strong evidence for formation -LRB- speciation -RRB- of and the extinction of species .
The first practical large scale application of stratigraphy was by William Smith in the 1790s and early 19th century .
Biologic stratigraphy was based on William Smith &apos; s principle of faunal succession , which predated , and was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for , biological evolution .
The geologic time scale was developed during the 19th century based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession .
It deals with the physical lithologic , or rock type , change both vertically in layering or bedding of varying rock type and laterally reflecting changing environments of deposition , known as facies change .
Stratigraphy , a branch of geology , studies rock layers and layering -LRB- stratification -RRB- .
The theoretical basis for the subject was established by Nicholas Steno who re-introduced the law of superposition and introduced the principle of original horizontality and principle of lateral continuity in a 1669 work on the fossilization of organic remains in layers of sediment .

At the same time , neither recognition is enough to create a state , nor does its absence abolish it . &apos; &apos;
The European Union , in the principal statement of its Badinter Committee , follows the Montevideo Convention in its definition of a state : by having a territory , a population , and a political authority .
The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications : -LRB- a -RRB- a permanent population ; -LRB- b -RRB- a defined territory ; -LRB- c -RRB- government ; and -LRB- d -RRB- capacity to enter into relations with the other states .
Some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient , as they allow less-recognized entities like the Republic of China -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- to claim full status as states .
The convention sets out the definition , rights and duties of statehood .
The committee also found that the existence of states was a question of fact , while the recognition by other states was purely declaratory and not a determinative factor of statehood .
At the conference , United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull declared the Good Neighbor Policy , which opposed U.S. armed intervention in inter-American affairs .
The convention was signed by 19 states .
According to the alternative constitutive theory of statehood , a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by other states .
It should not be confused with the Estrada doctrine .
Some non-territorial entities , notably the Sovereign Military Order of Malta , are indeed considered subjects of international law , but these do not aspire to statehood .
Most well-known is article 1 , which sets out the four criteria for statehood that have sometimes been recognized as an accurate statement of customary international law :
This is known as the declarative theory of statehood .
Founders of non-territorial micronations commonly assert that the requirement in the Montevideo Convention of a defined territory is in some way wrong-headed , for largely unspecified reasons .
Furthermore , the first sentence of article 3 explicitly states that `` The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states . &apos; &apos;
Switzerland , although not a member of the European Union , adheres to the same principle , stating that `` neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state , nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one .
There have also been attempts to further broaden the convention &apos; s definition , although they have gained less support .
The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States was a treaty signed at Montevideo , Uruguay , on December 26 , 1933 , during the Seventh International Conference of American States .
