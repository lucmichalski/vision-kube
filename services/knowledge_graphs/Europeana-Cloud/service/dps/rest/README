Metadata and Content Service REST API.

This application should be deployed on servlet container and has been tested on Tomcat 7.0.
Default profile uses in-memory implementation of services. 

In order to use Cassandra/OpenStack Swift/Solr services, the application must be built with "persistent" profile. 
This implementation relies on external services and all connection details must be provided as jndi properties in Tomcat. 
See META-INF/context.xml for a list of properties that are used by the application in persistent mode.
