# S3weed
S3-like proxy for Weed-FS

# Status

*Alpha*
It needs some more work, test cases, and so on, and maybe the interface will change too!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tgulacsi/s3weed.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tgulacsi/s3weed)

# Goals

Provide a proxy for Weed-FS (and possibly for other stores) which makes
it usable with a general S3 client.

# Code structure
The interface definition is under `s3intf`:

* `Storage` is the interface for the storage (store and retrieve),
* `Owner` is the object's owner (authentication)

`s3srv.Service` is an implementation of the HTTP server which acts as an S3 server;
it requires the host:port to listen on, and an implementation of `s3intf.Storage`.

See [s3impl/main.go](s3impl/main.go).

At the moment, there are two implementations are in this repo of `s3intf.Storage`:

## `s3impl/dirS3`
is a very-very simple implementation which stores everything
in files under the given root. The first level of subdirectories are the `Owner`s,
the next are the buckets, and under this are the files -
another level of subdirectories should be implemented for smaller directory
sizes, if this would be a proper implementation, not just a toy!

## `s3impl/weedS3`
is an implementation which stores metadata
(object name - file id (and file name, size and md5)) locally in
`basedir/owner/bucket.kv` files (using [kv](https://github.com/cznic/kv) for database),
and uses [Weed-FS](https://code.google.com/p/weed-fs) for file data storage.

This does not have any authentication (**uses empty password**) ATM.

### Dump
Some functions are lift up to [weedutils](s3impl/weedS3/weedutils) to be able
to dump the metadata:

    s3impl -db=/tmp/weedS3 dump

Example:

    find /tmp/weedS3 -ls
```

```

    ./s3impl/s3impl -db=/tmp/weedS3 dump

# Usage

    go build github.com/tgulacsi/s3weed/s3impl
    mkdir -p /tmp/weedS3/anowner
    s3impl -db=/tmp/weedS3 -weed=http://localhost:9333 -http=s3.localhost:80

  Some testing with [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) is in
  [s3cmd-test.sh](s3cmd-test.sh)

## Caveeats
I've tested with s3cmd, but that seems to implement only the DNS-named buckets
(you set the bucket name in the server name: testbucket.s3.localhost).
Thus you need to resolve the "bucketname".fqdn to fqdn - add

    127.0.0.1   localhost   s3.localhost    testbucket.s3.localhost

to your /etc/hosts file, for example.

I couldn't find (yet) why no filename is transferred with s3cmd.

# TODO

  * authorization - `.pwd` file under `basedir/owner`? Or in `basedir/auth.kv`?
  * calculate how much overhead does this `kv` database imposes
  * testing with real-world S3 clients
  * tests
  * more tests
